[Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. ","We ask that you note that elements of this presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We also identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning, we'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011, as well as share with you our updated guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012 and, of course, allow time for your questions. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had another great quarter marked by terrific execution with continued growth in most of our end markets. And then yielded earnings per share above the high end of the previous range. Our reported sales were $9.5 billion, up 8% reported or 7% organic, reflecting continued advancement in our new products and the focus on high-growth regions. We ended the year with segment margins of 15.1%, expanding 90 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year. Then pro forma earnings per share were $1.05, up 21% over last year. Free cash flow was an impressive $1.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting 169% net income conversion prior to a $250 million cash pension contribution. Our 2011 performance underscored our balanced portfolio mix and strength of execution. New products, geographic expansion and traction on key process initiatives, all translated to record organic growth, margin expansion, high-quality earnings performance and strong free cash flow generation. And we did all this while continuing to maintain our seed-planting for the future. ","In the fourth quarter, we had another quarter of robust new product launches and big wins starting with Process Solutions, who was awarded a highly competitive 15-year $90 million contract to completely overhaul the technology controlling the massive Los Angeles wastewater treatment system, ousting the incumbent in the process. Building Solutions & Distribution expanded their Smart Grid wins internationally with a project that will help connect up the 30 commercial and industrial buildings in the Thames Valley area, west of London. This will help alleviate the potential for future bottlenecks as the peak demand for energy grows. Honeywell is helping to create a more agile grid, without the public disruption or expense of major infrastructure upgrades. ","UOP, as you might expect, also did well within the quarter. National Refinery Limited awarded UOP a major Uniflex project in Pakistan. As a reminder, Uniflex is the process technology that maximizes the conversion of crude residues. Think of it is as the bottom of the barrel to high-quality transportation fuel. Uniflex technology can significantly increase refinery margins $2 to $4 a barrel over other conventional technologies, and that's a big competitive advantage for our customers. ","The emerging regions are continuing strong and now comprise approximately 20% of our total sales. We're seeing the biggest increases in Turbo, Commercial Aerospace, UOP and Process and Building Solutions, with sales up approximately 20% again in the fourth quarter for China, India and the Middle East combined. ","Turning to 2012. We still think the high probability outcome is for slow growth economic environment. That said, our developed market order rates are mixed with continued growth in the U.S., partially offset by weakness in Europe short-cycle businesses. We still expect these businesses to grow but at a more moderate rate in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the commercial Aero aftermarket remains robust with spares and R&O continuing to outpace flight hours. And our longer-cycle businesses like commercial Aero OE, Process Solutions and UOP are increasing backlog with our total book-to-bill rate above 1.2. ","Dave will walk you through an updated view by business when he discusses the outlook for the first quarter of 2012. But from an overall Honeywell perspective, we remain confident in our ability to sustain good growth, while continuing to expand margins over the course of 2012. So once again, 2011 is further proof that our strategies are working, and we think we've got a balanced plan for 2012 that incorporates the current economic realities, as well as the benefits derived from our continued seed-planting initiatives. ","And finally, we think that puts us in excellent position to achieve our 2014 sales and margin commitments. Having great positions in good industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving every year in each of our 5 initiatives, it really makes a difference. ","So with that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David James Anderson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So let's start off on Slide #4, and I'll take you through the fourth quarter highlights, just adding to Dave's comments. As you can see, reported sales of $9.5 billion, up 8%, 7% underlying organic growth in the quarter, so continued strong organic growth and a finish for 2011. Acquisitions contributed about 2% of growth, and we had about a currency of 1% headwind in the quarter. On a regional basis, as expected, Europe was lower in growth. However, we saw strong organic continued growth from the Americas, up about 7%. The Middle East, China and India combined were up almost 20%. ","Segment profit growth was 15% in the fourth quarter. Margins increased by 90 basis points to 15.1%. We had margin expansion in all 4 business segments. Price, productivity, net of inflation continue obviously to be the key drivers of profitable growth for us. ","Moving below the line, all items were in the range of their quarterly run rates. Tax, we had a 27.5% effective tax rate on pro forma earnings. That's as expected and as we guided, but of course, ahead of our usual 26.5%, and that's the ETR, where we finished the year, again, consistent with the guidance that we gave you in July. Pro forma earnings per share, that is excluding the impact of the fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment, $1.05, 21% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. And by the way, that 2010 fourth quarter included $0.03 for discontinued operations from CPG. So, if we really adjust it on a continuing operations basis, we're up 25% EPS fourth quarter. ","Now the reported EPS included $1.8 billion of pension mark-to-market adjustment, taking reported earnings actually to a loss of $0.40 per share in the quarter. Free cash flow prior to pension contributions, finished strong, $1.4 billion. Working capital was a strong source of cash in the quarter, driven by operational improvements across the board. ","So let's now go to the next slide and go through the full year numbers. Slide #5. Sales for the year up 13% to $36.5 billion. That includes, by the way, and reflects record 8% organic growth for Honeywell. Acquisitions contributed 3%. Foreign exchange was a tailwind of approximately 2% for the full year. Segment profit increased 19%. Margins expanded 80 basis points to 14.7%. And, Dave, I think that's a record for us as well. This was another strong year for profit growth and margin expansion, which clearly demonstrates our ability to deliver productivity from operations while also providing value from a sales and marketing excellence. ","Pro forma earnings, $4.05, a remarkable 35%, or $1.05, increase versus 2010. And again, below-the-line expenses, excluding the ongoing pension expense, were relatively flat year-over-year, when you consider that onetime gains were deployed. That's pretty impressive when you consider the number onetime gains that we successfully deployed that will fund repositioning and other items over the course of the year. And then, of course, also reflects the loss of CPG earnings in the second half of the year. ","Now, as a reminder, we funded approximately $350 million of repositioning in 2011. All of it offset by gains. In addition to funding a number of other projects and considerable investment in R&D, new product introductions, which, of course, sets us up nicely for 2012, 2013 and beyond. Reported EPS was $2.61, up slightly over 2010. That, of course, includes the MTM  adjustment I mentioned earlier. Free cash flow was $3.7 billion and that's prior to pension contributions, 115% net income conversion. ","So now let's go through the highlights of each of the segments, and I'll reference fourth quarter as well as full year numbers, starting with Aero on Slide 6. ","As you can see, Aerospace sales up 8% in the quarter, 6% organic. Commercial sales were up 20%, driven by continued momentum in the commercial aftermarket as well as strong shipments to OEs. And of course, that was partially offset in the quarter by lower Defense sales. Commercial OE sales grew by 18%, 12% organic, excluding the EMS acquisition. We saw growth in Boeing and Airbus deliveries driven by the ramp-up in production rates, partially offset by lower regional jet deliveries. Business Aviation OE is continuing to benefit from shipments of high-value Honeywell content on new production aircraft, 16% organic growth, taking into account lower launch contributions versus 2010, as well as the EMS acquisitions. ","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 21% in the quarter. We saw growth of spares and R&O. Those trended differently, as you know, over this recovery cycle. We had strong growth in both in the quarter, and the aftermarket levels are now above prior peak levels, and that's measured in absolute terms. Spares were up 28%, and, by the way, up 28% also for the full year, reflecting continued strong demand globally. The commercial R&O was up 18% over last year, although roughly flat over the third quarter level. So based on the high utilization of existing fleets, we expect continued growth in 2012, although at a slower pace as the quarter-over-quarter comps get tougher. ","Just a quick minute to go through a couple of the details here. In air transport and regional flight hours, those were up approximately 3.4% in the quarter, and we expect that kind of moderated pace to continue through 2012. Layering on top of the flight hour growth, we've seen older aircraft, which need, obviously, more spare parts and repair and overhaul, return to service and we're benefiting from that. We're also seeing increased sales of newly launched, enhanced safety and navigation software upgrades. Just to give you a couple of examples, a couple specifics of that. Primus Epic and synthetic vision cockpit upgrades, SmartRunway and SmartLanding for airport and runway awareness and Flight Management System upgrades for next-generation Air Traffic Management. Additionally, our high-speed satellite communications packages are doing well, as customers desire more global connectivity solutions. And as you all know, these are high margin contributors that continue to expand our product portfolio, and all of this bodes well for the aftermarket segment of Aerospace in 2012. ","Now as expected, Defense and Space sales were down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by program completions and also program ramp-downs. Our service contract completions, ramp-down of funding for the T-Hawk micro air vehicle, partially offset by growth in our short-cycle aftermarket sales in Defense. Now as a reminder, international aftermarket sales were particularly strong in the fourth quarter of 2010. They contributed to a very difficult comp in the quarter, and as we've discussed with you in numerous occasions, we continue to plan for further U.S. Defense budgetary pressures and reprogramming, and we're planning for modest declines in Defense and Space overall in 2012. ","Now Aero's segment profit was up 40 basis points in the quarter to 18.8%, due to strong commercial aftermarket volume that I referenced, as well as productivity benefits, net of inflation. These were partially offset by higher R&D investments, net of launch payment favorability and the dilution associated with the EMS acquisition. So on an apples-to-apples basis, sales conversion for Aerospace was up just over 30% in the quarter. Now as 2012 unfolds, we'll continue to monitor the macro indicators, obviously, in Aerospace, as well as -- and by segment, as well as by region. But as we sit here today, we expect aftermarket growth to outpace flight hours, and we expect good sales conversion and margin expansion within the Aerospace segment throughout the year. ","Let's go now to Slide 7, ACS. Sales for ACS were up 4% in the quarter. We had favorable impact of acquisitions, offsetting negative foreign currency translation. ACS continued to see good growth globally, with pockets of anticipated softness in Europe, where sales were down mid-single digits. The emerging markets remained strong for ACS, with double-digit sales growth in India and the Middle East. Growth in China for the quarter was a little bit muted, but continued softness in the residential and industrial sectors for EPC, as well as for Life Safety. ","Now for ESS, the Energy Safety and Security business. Sales were up 3% organic, driven primarily by strength in scanning mobility but also in security and sense of control. HPS sales in the quarter were up 2% organic, as they lapped a very strong fourth quarter of 2010. And you'll recall last year is a very robust recovery in Field Devices. We actually had 30% growth in that business segment of HPS in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now orders for HPS were strong in the quarter, up 11%, adding over $900 million of new wins. Dave mentioned earlier, HPS has been awarded fairly highly competitive projects in 2011, and we're planning for accelerated revenue growth in HPS in 2012. ","BSD, or the Building Solutions & Distribution business of ACS. 6% organic sales growth. We had strong security distribution sales in the Americas. We also had improving backlog conversion on several large public-private partnerships, as well as energy efficient -- efficiency projects in the Solutions side. The commercial retrofit activity in these markets continues to show modest signs of life. ACS did softer order books in October and November in their trade and distribution channels, as well as the slowing in China, namely on the HVAC side and ECP but also in the fire products and Life Safety side. However, December exit rates showed improvement, so it's something, obviously, we'll continue to watch closely over the coming months. Now as expected, segment margins for ACS expanded very nicely in the quarter, up 130 basis points to 14.4%. It reflects primarily, obviously, higher organic growth and volume leverage but also very good execution on acquisition integration and good cost controls. ACS also benefited by lapping the headwinds associated with last year's M&A accounting for the Sperian acquisition. ","So for the full year, ACS sales were up 13%. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points, to 13.4%. And we expect ACS margins to continue this expansion for us in 2012, and feel confident in their ability to reach that 15% to 16% target that we've set for them by 2014. ","Let's go now to Slide #8, look at Performance Materials & Technologies, PMT. So PMT had double-digit growth at both UOP and Advanced Materials in the fourth quarter. Sales were up 24% and, by the way, we guided it to 21% to 26% for PMT in the quarter, so it's sort of at the -- little towards the high end of that guidance. 17% organic, and segment margin was up 80 basis points to 15.6%, which included the dilutive impact of the phenol plant acquisition that closed in late July. ","Now sales at UOP were up an impressive 36% in the quarter, delivering upside with refining and specialty catalysts sales of almost 40%, as well as growth in projects and services. Demand fundamentals for UOP remained robust. UOP exited the year with record backlog, a book-to-bill ratio above 1.3. And in the quarter, UOP signed significant contracts for new technologies. They also benefited from the feed portion of their large Petrobras project, and they were selected by Petrobras in the quarter to provide gas separation technology for other offshore processing units. So that just continues to be a good news story. UOP is also well positioned for another strong growth year in 2002 (sic) [ 2012 ] with higher sales conversion driven by favorable project and the catalyst mix, which will offset most of the pricing headwinds that we expect and we've guided you to in Advanced Materials in the first half of 2012. ","Turning to Advanced Materials. Sales were up 18% in the quarter, 7% organic, with continued favorability in terms of pricing in RNC [ph], offsetting slower demand in Fluorine. And as a reminder, and really it's very notable with that 18% reported, 7% organic, the phenol acquisition obviously contributed importantly in the quarter, but was $80 million in revenues compared to about $120 million that we'd included in our original guidance. And that's just the function of the flow-through of a reduction in commodity costs, no real change in volume there, just a reduction in both phenol and acetone pricing in the quarter. Now Fluorines in the quarter continued to see price declines due to increased availability of supply of refrigerants globally. We've seen signs of global demand slowing for resins and specialty products, with some inventory destocking as a result, partially offset by continued uptake from new product applications. So overall, obviously, a great year for PMT, record margins of 18.4%. Clearly, a credit to the work that Andreas and the team have done  capitalizing on the strengths of their businesses, with a lot of emphasis on new technologies, products, as well as new applications. ","Let's turn now to Slide 9, Transportation Systems. In the quarter, TS sales were up almost 10%, driven by volume increases primarily in Turbo, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro. Now turbocharger sales continued to outperform the industry macros. European light vehicle production was roughly flat in the quarter year-over-year, and European diesel penetration expanded 3 points to a record 62%. Sales for TS for the full year were up 21%. Turbo unit shipments exceeded prior peak levels that we had recorded in 2011. And that reflects our high win rate on both gas and diesel platforms, as well as obviously increased Turbo penetration globally. ","Sales in Europe for TS have moderated, consistent with slowing vehicle production rates. Sales in the emerging regions, however, improved with sequential improvement in China, despite commercial vehicle sales for the year being down due to reduced government incentives. India continued strong in the quarter, with increased demand from local OEs. Now segment profit was up 14% in the quarter for TS. Expanding margins 40 basis points, they had strong productivity gains, partially offset by inflation and negative mix from some softer aftermarket sales. So for the year, segment profit for TS was solid, expanding 150 basis points to 12.6%. ","So with that review of the 4 business segments, let's go to Slide 10 and transition to 2012 and talk about our preview for the first quarter. ","Turning to Slide 10. In total, we're planning for first quarter total company sales in the range of $9 billion to $9.2 billion, up 4% to 6% from last year, assuming a euro rate of 1.30. And I think last year, first quarter, Elena, we had a euro rate average of about 1.40. So at EPS, we're looking at $0.93 to $0.98, up 6% to 11% on a reported basis, 8% to 14% on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the earnings, the $0.02 from discontinued operations, which is, of course, the CPG. And of course, and just as a reminder, that not only that $0.02 impact of not having CPG in the first quarter, we'll have that also for the second quarter, given the timing, as you recall, of July 2011 sale of CPG. ","So let's just take a minute and walk through the rest of the first quarter and talk about those business segments. So in Aerospace, for the first quarter, we expect a continuation of more than -- more of the same, commercial OEM aftermarket momentum lifting the segment higher, partially offset by a relatively flattish outlook in Defense. So as a result, we expect sales to be up for Aero, 7% to 9%, with margins expanding nicely despite the bigger role that an unfavorable mix will play in 2012. And as a reminder, specifically, what I mean by that is, we're expecting commercial OE sales to grow at approximately double the rate of aftermarket growth for Aerospace in 2012. ","For ACS, for the first quarter, we expect revenue growth in the 2% to 4% range. Now that includes the impact of slower growth due to weak European and residential markets affecting our short cycle ESS businesses. In addition, we expect foreign exchange headwinds to more than offset the net benefit from acquisitions, so about 2%. However, on the other side, we anticipate acceleration in Process and Building Solutions growth given the expected strong backlog conversion. So as a result, we expect ACS margins to be up approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter over 2011 and on track to their outlook for the full year. ","At Performance Materials, we anticipate sales up a strong 12% to 15%, growth driven by robust sales at UOP and favorable impact of the phenol acquisition, which would add about 8% to 9% and moderate growth, organic growth in Advanced Materials. From a margin standpoint, we would expect PMT to be down of their record 21% margin that they had in the first quarter of 2011, but still in the range of the first quarter of 2012, in the range of their full year 2011 segment margin rates. So still very attractive, very impressive. ","Transportation System sales are expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter. It reflects an 8% decline in the Western European light vehicle production, coupled with foreign currency headwind of approximately 3 points, offset by robust new launches and an expected increase in European diesel penetration year-over-year. And I referenced that 62% diesel penetration in Western Europe where we ended the year. And in light of the current demand expectations, we expect the first quarter 2012 margins for TS to be in line with how they exited 2011. ","So in summary, we're looking for another good growth quarter in the first quarter of '12 despite a more challenging economic backdrop, and we're obviously anticipating nice income conversion. ","So let's now go to Slide 11, the full year 2012 financial guidance summary. And as you can see, nothing really new to report here. We reaffirmed our financial outlook for 2012 that we gave you mid-December of 2011. We anticipate sales for Honeywell in total to be in the range of 4% to 7%, up this year $37.8 billion to $38.9 billion on a reported basis, up 4% to 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Segment margins to grow 15% to 15.3% for the year, up from 2011's 14.7%. And of course, EPS, $4.25 to $4.50. It reflects 5% to 11% increase over the $4.05 base just completed for 2011. ","Now again, the guidance assumes a flat effective tax rate year-over-year of 26.5%. Share count roughly equivalent to our fourth quarter exit rate. We're also assuming a de minimis amount of repositioning charges consistent with our approach to fund repositioning with onetime nonoperating gains. ","On cash, we're planning for around 100% cash flow conversion. So translating to free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion. Importantly, before any potential NARCO trust funding or further voluntary pension funding. And on pension, our guidance assumes level contributions over the course of 2012 of $200 million to $250 million per quarter, but we'll actually do that as the year unfolds and we'll manage that, measure it as the year unfolds. ","Now we finished the year approximately 83% funded globally, with the U.S. portion slightly better on a year-over-year basis. The 2012 ongoing pension expense will be favorable by about $50 million versus 2011, which for now will appear to offset the potential for further foreign currency downside. So think of that, if you will, as added contingency, some of which is reflected in that first quarter guidance that we gave you. ","And again, on the bottom of the page, you could see some of the variables that may influence our performance in the year and form the basis for our guidance range. So the 5 outcomes as we talked about mid-December on the left, would cause the earnings to be closer to the low end of the range and, obviously, those on the right would cause earnings to be at the higher end of the range. And we feel, again, the range is broad enough to incorporate these varying outcomes, as well as just the overall macro uncertainty that exists in today's environment. ","So Slide 12, a terrific year for Honeywell. Just to recap before turning it over to Elena for your Q&A. Capping off an impressive 10-year transformation at Honeywell. Our performance track record over that time, underpins the operational and financial disciplines that you've come to expect from us. And while we've come a long way, we obviously feel even better about our future. ","That said, based on all we're seeing and hearing, 2012 will be a more challenging overall environment. While order rates remain positive overall, we've seen some weaknesses, as I've cited, in Europe and China, in energy, safety and security, as well as in our Advanced Materials. On balance, our long-cycle businesses, those orders continue to show a healthy pace and they'll contribute to very good growth for Honeywell in 2012. ","We're expecting sales in the developed regions, primarily the U.S. and Europe to moderate but still outpace GDP over the course of 2012 through increase penetration, new product introductions, as well as market share gain. Everything we're seeing says, we're going to be living through an economic downturn in Europe through the first half of 2012, which is reflected in our orders and our sales outlook. The good news here is that with approximately 40% of our European sales not affected by the near-term macro uncertainty, as we continue to convert the long cycle backlog of Commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions at UOP, and continue to enjoy the robustness of the commercial aftermarket -- commercial Aerospace aftermarket. ","Now we're expecting strong operating performance again in '12, increasing our sales conversion, whether it's our relentless focus on cycle time both commercial and R&D effectiveness, controlling our fixed costs through OES, layering in the benefits from ongoing repositioning actions. And we'll continue to deliver another year of continued margin expansion and 100% free cash flow conversion. ","And, of course, we plan to update you on our long-term outlook at our upcoming Annual Investor Conference in New York City, Wednesday, March 7. You'll hear more from Dave about how the diligent deployment of our key process initiatives over the last decade has set us up for an even better future. And we'll showcase the evolution of those initiatives that underscore the organization's ability to be a top-tier performer with a balanced portfolio, short- and long-cycle businesses and a disciplined playbook focused on smart cost management. Again, positioning Honeywell for top-tier performance again in 2012, as well as beyond. ","So with that, Elena, let's go to -- turn it over to you for Q&A with our audience.","Elena Doom","Thank you. Stephanie, if you can now open the line, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just want to ask about -- first, let me just start with the first quarter versus the rest of the year. What risk do you see or how much are you relying on that sort of second half pickup macro in Europe? And how much is in your control, do you think, to -- versus not -- I mean, in terms of the degree to which you're covered at the low end of that range?","David M. Cote","Well, it's always tougher, of course, because you have to make some kind of forecast about the economy. So we're not assuming global recession, for example. And then all bets would be off if that were true. So it's a little tougher to answer that way. I would just say, I feel pretty confident that our ability to deliver at this point, with most of it being within our control. And we're not counting on that much for the second half in Europe improving that much there, because who knows. It's kind of tough to say, it's going to go dip but only for 6 months. We hope that's the case. But we're not counting on that. We're kind of just assuming that it's a slow growth, global economy, the whole year. Dave, anything you want to add?","David James Anderson","I would just say that the -- one little added color, Dave, I would give to that is, at ACS, we're going to see a stronger Process and Building Solutions first half based on the backlog that we have. We'll see a little stronger on a relative basis, we're going to see a stronger second half ESS and, if you will, Products for ACS. We'll actually see some of that benefit over the course of the year just in terms of margin rates and margin rate build for ACS.","Elena Doom","In addition to the...","David M. Cote","So it's not driven by macro...","David James Anderson","No.","David M. Cote","So much as it is we had about heating season, for example, and we don't expect a bad cooling -- we're not assuming a bad cooling season on top of a bad heating season.","David James Anderson","Exactly.","David M. Cote","Does that make sense, Steve?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It does. And then just digging into the ACS points that you raised. We know -- there's obviously always the mix impact between the product and the -- or the new product definition and the solutions definition. But as I recall, you'd been making very strong headway within HBS and within HPS on margins, dramatically, over the last decade. I mean, so how much lift is that giving you continued or has that sort of -- are you at the point of diminishing returns on the margin front within each of those businesses?","David M. Cote","I'm not a believer that margins have ever peaked in the Honeywell portfolio. I'd say, in every business, we still have pretty good runway, that's not just limited to Process or Building Solutions.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But specifically, within those, because those were the ones that were obviously lower by nature. How are those progressing?","David M. Cote","They're progressing fine. I would say, if you said, in Building Solutions, will we evolved to a 20% margin at some point? The answer would be no. That's not going to happen. But we could still grow from where we are. There's still runway there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And that, as I recall, was just low double digits, in that range?","David M. Cote","It is on the low side, yes.","Elena Doom","The Building Solutions and Distribution is a mid-single digit margin business, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The Process, I meant.","Elena Doom","The Process is double digit. It's actually low teens.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, okay. All right.","David James Anderson","But there is a point though that we will see that favorability in terms of margin rate as we see that shift in terms of stronger products.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on pricing versus inflation, because I've been looking at that. It looks to me like the trends are starting to reverse -- to become more positive on that front. Are you guys -- how are you anticipating that developing over the year?","David M. Cote","Well, we've actually always done pretty well there, because as you know where we drive most a pricing improvement is from new products that add a lot more value to the customer. I know that's an overused word out there, but it can be true, and we've been doing that. So we don't expect that to change all that much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch from Bank of America.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask about your guide for the year. I mean, I realize your history, Dave, is pretty conservative. But it just seems a little, almost too conservative. Like a lot of companies are sort of calling out this week first quarter, given the European issues, given the compares. The midpoint of your first quarter guide of up 11% is the high end of your annual guide of up 11%, and your 4% to 6% revenue midpoint, right? The midpoint is the low end of your -- I guess, I'm just trying to understand. I heard a little bit of some of this color, but is there a way to just sort of think about first half, second half and why up 5% EPS this year is even on the table?","David James Anderson","Well, I think, Steve -- or John rather, I'm sorry. There's a couple of things, I think, in that first quarter. Number 1, I think, we've referenced that we've got foreign currency headwind of a couple of points. We've got also the CPG continuing operations comparison, which is about $0.02. And as you said, if you look at the midpoint of our guide for the first quarter, that translates into a very nice full year, when you look at it in terms of our historic linearity. And frankly, when we look at the numbers on a full year basis, both the implied organic growth in our guidance, as well as the EPS growth in our guidance, those trends tend to be very much in line -- in the ballpark.","David M. Cote","We feel we're at the high end of the ballpark, actually.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What -- I'm sorry, what's the high end of the ballpark?","David M. Cote","The guidance that we've provided.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Meaning you -- you're meaning, you're suggesting that the midpoint is the high end of what you think is reasonable? I'm sorry, I don't mean to...","David M. Cote","When we look at the range that we think we've provided for guidance in what's an uncertain economic environment, we think, compared to everybody else out there, we tend to be more towards the high side. And we don't like being too bullish on what we think the economy or currency is going to do or count on anything like that, because we just don't think those things can turn against you too easily.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's fair. Dave Cote, do you have contingency plans if things do turn down and the 5% which, again, doesn't seem realistic. But if it comes more into the realm of possibility, do you have contingency plans from what you would do vis-a-vis restructuring may not -- you obviously did a lot last year, I'm just -- how do you think about this year in that basis?","David M. Cote","Well, given what's going on over the last 4 years, we always think in terms of having flexibility in both directions. Because You just don't know. And things could be better than what we think they're going to be, and you need to be able to respond to upside also. But conversely, things could be worse. And we need to be able to be prepared to respond that way. So the big message at our Leadership Conference this year, for example, was the same as it has been for the last couple of years, and that's flexibility. You've got to be able to have flexibility in both directions. Be very careful about how you hire, but also be very careful about never going too far, because you just don't know which way things are going to go. And you have to be prepared. You got to be on your toes. You just don't know.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just lastly, what do you think normalized organic growth is at ACS? I mean, I realized you see -- did 4% this quarter, you got difficult resi and you've got the European issues. But then you've got booming energy markets and you guys have done a great job with the new product introductions. I mean, if you were to kind of normalize a lot of factors, how do you think about growth over the trend line in that business, in that segment, sorry?","David M. Cote","It's another one where it depends on what's the economy that's the backdrop to that. So it's a tough one to answer. And that's why the way we tend to always talk about it, John, is that we feel that given the end markets that we are in, we can outperform our peers in any economic conditions. Because we think we've done all the work that we need to, to have great positions in good industries, the One Honeywell, 5 initiatives, we keep working that. That's put us in a better position to outperform. But it is tough to say, so what's the natural growth dynamic of the business, because it depends on what global GDP is going to be.","David James Anderson","I think one of the things, Dave, just to add to what you said is, Roger has always said, and I think we've seen numbers that bear this out, at around 2x GDP, in terms of the underlying growth rate of the business. So that translates into pretty...","David M. Cote","So we'll work to make that 2.5x GDP, 3x GDP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, can we get an update on cost cuts and where we have headwinds and tailwinds, things like ERP and other kind of discretionary or project-related costs. Just to get a sense of where the tailwinds and headwinds are.","David M. Cote","Boy, I have a tough time thinking beyond what we already listed on -- We don't expect material inflation to be particularly onerous. We don't expect labor inflation to be particularly onerous. When it comes to any kind of major projects that we have, there's no one that's so big that it drives the thinking of the company. So I'm hard-pressed to think of anything that I find troublesome right now.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Even ERP?","David James Anderson","No. I think we're at run rate on ERP. I think, kind of back to an earlier question, Dave, I think pricing will offset inflation. We've got productivity, obviously, is a key driver in terms of our net margin expansions. So we talk about margin expansion range for the company, and we think it's going to be pretty attractive this year. That's really driven by net productivity. And there's no single item, Scott, that stands out. R&D, we've talked about R&D year-over-year 2010 to 2011 for Aerospace. But as we talked about, that really to moderate and if it goes up in absolute dollars, it's steady as a percent of revenues in 2012. So there's no single item I don't think I would point to.","David M. Cote","In ERP, we're close to done.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that's more of a 2013, that rolls off and it gets easier then, is that what you're saying?","David M. Cote","No, you're saying that where there's a big benefit from not having to put -- continuing to invest in ERP?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. And spending on duplicate systems derived.","David M. Cote","I think we'll see some of that. Again, I wouldn't point to those something that's going to make our year, for example.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. No, I understand. I'm just trying to get a sense of the puts and takes. But let's move on. Defense and Space, this may be perceived as kind of a strange question. But does Defense and Space going down hurt margins or help margins when you think about the overall segment? I guess, what I'm saying is, you've got the fixed cost coverage issue with some contracts, but you may be rolling off some lower margin contracts. So when you think about Defense and Space down, let's say down 4% or 5% in 2012, does that -- is that a tailwind to overall margins or a headwind?","David M. Cote","In my view, it's -- because of the way pricing works there, things tend to stay flat. So good or bad, it kind of stays where it is. It's just part of the pricing model. So I wouldn't expect to see a big boost or a big negative going in either direction.","David James Anderson","Dave, I would just say, just in a word that it's summarizing and agreeing with what you said, it's really neutral in terms of Aerospace margins. And as I said earlier, Scott, we're going to see some margin lift, obviously, in Aerospace in the first quarter, as well as for the full year 2012 despite -- we continue to anticipate it. I think, we've got it 4% to 5% down revenues for the year.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, just a quick one. I mean, your incremental margins in transportation I think were about 16% or so. When I think about Turbo back in kind of the \"glory days,\" if you will, the last cycle, margins were higher, kind of 17%, I think, it was something that was talked about back -- a ways back and now, a little bit lower. What can get you there? I mean, is it a different price environment, where you just can't print that kind of margin anymore? Or can you get the volume pull-through to get back to those kind of glory day margins at some point in the next few years?","David M. Cote","Well, we have -- there's another business in Transportation Systems.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure, yes. I understand that. But given how important Turbo is, there's no way the Turbo margins could be -- well, I guess there is a way, but...","David James Anderson","We had -- to Dave's point though, we did have headwinds in the quarter from our Friction business, which encountered a pretty significant commodity cost increase. And it's the type of business and the kind of environment where it just -- you just can't pass through or pass through as much clearly as what you are impacted by, so you need to absorb that. So really, most of what we've talked about, Scott, in terms of that phenomena of what you would expected in conversion of the business versus historic is really explained by Friction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","We will move onto our next question. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to get some more color on some of the key geographies, you touched on this in the prepared remarks, both between Europe and China. And for Europe, you first started talking about this in September with some of the softer signs of destocking in the Building Solutions Distribution. How has that played out and beyond just the European Auto, lower production expectations?","David M. Cote","So you're just talking about Auto or...","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No. Just broadly the conditions in Europe. Because at first you talked about the softness was in September, where you first started to seeing some of the destocking. It sounds like that's the same conditions that you've been facing in the fourth quarter and just at the margin how has that played out?","David M. Cote","Yes. The way I would describe it is if we went back to that August-September time frame, we actually saw Europe orders dip, go negative for about 2 weeks. So we start to get really concerned, and that it bounced right back. At this time, I'd say it's been negative for about 6 to 7 weeks in a row. So if it were me, I'm not an economist, but I would say they're in a recession now. It might not be a big one, like we all hope it won't be. But I would say they're in recession now and that's the way we're thinking about it. We're thinking about the whole year as being a slight recession in Europe.","David James Anderson","Deane, if I could add just a little bit to Dave's comments on Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we've got some important differences, obviously, when you look across the portfolio because Aerospace, Dave, as you know, the commercial aftermarket business is...","David M. Cote","They're doing fine.","David James Anderson","Is doing very well. So that's very important to know. The other thing is in Transportation Systems because of -- in Turbo, because of the strength of our position and our wins and new platforms, we actually continue to see volume, good volume growth there.","Elena Doom","Strong double digits.","David James Anderson","Strong double digits. So what Dave is really referencing, which is really correct in kind of where you started, Deane, with your question, is really when you look at some of the traditional energy, kind of Life Safety and Security segments of the business, that's where we're seeing it most pronounced.","David M. Cote","Well, maybe I misunderstood your question, Deane. I thought what you're trying to get is, a sense for is Europe's economic environment. What are we seeing  or what did we think was going on there.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, that addressed it. And I just want to see, did it start to -- the destocking and the shorter cycle stuff was expected, and had you seen it begin to worm into some push-outs and any of your longer cycle businesses and it doesn't sound like that's happened.","David James Anderson","No, that has not occurred.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, how about over in China. And broadly, you said the emerging markets is up 20% but then you gave some data points on ACS, softer October, November in HVAC. But what -- and you wouldn't be the first company this earnings season to say that it's seeing a slowdown in the fourth quarter but how are you characterizing the business today?","David M. Cote","I would say I'm very glad that we've got the kind of presence that we do -- that we have in China and it keeps growing. We were up very strong double digit in China again this quarter, and we expect that to continue this year.","David James Anderson","Yes. What we cited, Deane, when we -- when I went through my review of ACS. I cited the fact, again, on the ECC side, we've seen, we've experienced softness. And we've seen basically the softness in the resi side on the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. So that is not a surprise at all, given the headlines in terms of commercial real estate, et cetera, what the government's doing in terms of government policy. On the other hand, as I cited, we're also seeing growth and some recovery in the Turbo commercial vehicle business. We've seen some softness on Fluorines, but we've seen continued relative strength on resins and chemicals. So it's, again, you kind of have to get a little bit specific. But the common theme, I think, between Europe and China is the sort of the short cycle energy, the combustion and the residential and the commercial markets and the retrofit markets have been softer. So that's where we've really seen the softness. But as Dave cited, overall, when you look at the overall numbers for Honeywell for China, they look very good.","David M. Cote","Very good.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great. And just last, a data point. You provided a backlog number, I think, for the first time in the third quarter on your longer-cycle businesses, it was $16 billion. Did you provide the update for how you ended the year?","David James Anderson","Yes. So backlog is about the same in terms of end of year for the total company, Deane. And U.S. continues to be very strong. Just a side, a couple of the specifics there in terms of the ending backlog, and this is comparing to the fourth quarter of 2010. On the ATR side, it's up 26%; BGA, up 24%; and at UOP, as I mentioned earlier, up 10%. So those are pretty good, I think, demonstrations. And by the way, the other interesting number is Defense and Space backlog, it's actually up 4%. So we've had across the board good positive momentum on the long-cycle business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just back to the backlog. Last year, and you gave this number in your 10-Ks, the number kind of to-be-shipped for the coming year. I think, last year you had a backlog of 14,616, and the to-be-shipped number was about 10,600. What's the to-be-shipped number this year, do you guys have that at hand there?","David James Anderson","I don't have that one at hand, sorry, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is it materially different as a percentage of the backlog? Did that stick out at all when you were going through your numbers at the end of the year?","David M. Cote","What I would say though, Steve, is when we look at the quarters, the 4, 5 quarters out, and we take a look at percentage of sales already in backlog, and it's better this year than it was last year.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Because when I kind of do the math on the, I guess, what I would consider to be book and ship, just to come for the next year. And you kind of subtract out that number, the percentage of backlog to be shipped and you just basically get to the book and ship number, it looks to me like kind of the midpoint of your range is up kind of low-single digits and the high end is up 5%. Last year, I think, it grew in the mid-teens. I guess, this is just reflective of what you guys were talking about, kind of some of the uncertainty in Europe and some of the macro concerns that are clearly at play with others in the group as well?","David M. Cote","Yes. I think generally, I think, you'd say that, Steve, to your point is you've got long cycle strength and then short cycle moderating. So that -- it's really the blend of those 2 that really represent that full year 4% to 7% up in terms of revenue guidance.","Elena Doom","And that number is probably a bigger percentage of our total revenue base in 2012 versus what it was in 2011.","David James Anderson","Right. Exactly.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Right, right. I mean, I still think if you guys are going 1% in that business, I think, we're -- we would might all be in trouble from an economic perspective. One last question just on the ACS margin. Clearly, a very strong conversion. Anything kind of unusual because now you're stepping down to the 25% in -- maybe I missed it in the comments. But you're stepping down to, I don't know, around the 25% incremental in the first quarter. Can you maybe help us to just break out a couple of the big moving parts there, what kind of impacted you the most?","David James Anderson","Well, I think, first of all, we were lapping a relatively not-strong conversion in the fourth quarter of 2010. The other thing we had is and we've referenced is we had positives in terms of M&A, so we didn't -- the Sperian acquisition and some other things, Steve, that benefited us 2011 compared to 2010. So that was a very strong quarter as anticipated for EPS. And when you look at the first quarter, what you've got is you've got some -- now M&A headwinds, because you've got EMS, as well as the King's acquisition, you've gotten a mixed headwind. I know Dave doesn't like me to talk about that. But the reality is, we're going to have a stronger Process versus -- and Solutions business, the BDS business compared to the ESS in the first quarter. That's just the phenomena that's occurring there. So it's really those things that are causing it. The other thing you got is you've got foreign currency now going the other direction, and that's a big item for ACS. When you look across FX impact in the total company, it isn't just the euro. It's also the Australian dollar, it's the Indian rupee, it's the Canadian dollar and they're really being impacted as we've seen a strengthening of all of these currencies relative to the dollars as we progressed through the final month of 2011.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And sorry, what was your order growth in HPS and then I'll hop off?","David James Anderson","Tell me again?","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was your order growth in HPS, Honeywell Process?","Elena Doom","11% organic in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Dave, you called out an interesting data point. I think you said 40% long cycle, 60% in short cycle in Europe, is that correct?","David James Anderson","I'm sorry?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think you called out your European sales as 40% long cycle and 60% short cycle.","David James Anderson","Yes, I referenced that. That's right.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. That's interesting. So of that long cycle, about how much of that is Aerospace?","David James Anderson","It's a very small portion of it. There's a -- well, obviously both BGA and ETR. But the biggest pieces there are really in our Solutions business and also in UOP.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, interesting. And then in your 2012 outlook slides, you had that chart showing the sequential trends in your short-cycle orders. I mean, we're only one month into 2012, but how would you characterize those sequential trends on short cycle? Would you say that's stabilized or are they still moving down a little bit?","David James Anderson","I would say that we're seeing in terms, if you're talking specifically in terms of what we're seeing to date, in the short-cycle businesses?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Exactly.","David James Anderson","Yes. Well, I think it's sort of -- unfortunately, it sort of an it depends. I mean, when you look at the Aero business, it's very good, Nigel. We talked about that in terms of just the continued strength that we're seeing in the Aerospace aftermarket. We're seeing good numbers in terms of Turbo HTT. Elena has cited that in terms of double digit, continued strong double digit. The softness, again, as I've talked about earlier, is really in the ESS, selectively within the ESS businesses at ACS. That's really where we've seen the most change in terms of moderation of growth or even in some segments, some market segments decline.","Elena Doom","And some pricing headwinds in Advanced Material.","David James Anderson","Yes, good. You're right.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But would you say they've found a floor at this point, or are they still moving a little bit softer, sequentially?","David James Anderson","I think in terms of our planning, from a planning standpoint, as you can see from all of the numbers, the guidance that we've given you is, we've given you revenue growth across the businesses. So I think the answer really is that what we're seeing is that we're going to continue to see growth in all of our businesses.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I hate to be a nerd, but a question on your effective tax rate on the mark-to-market. It's past 37% on the 2010 mark-to-market, and it's up quite a bit from 2010. Again, bear with me here, but it means, first of all, why would that tax rate move up? And then secondly, is that similar to the tax shield you get on your pension contributions?","David James Anderson","Well, what it is -- it's just reflective, if you look at 2011's mark-to-market versus 2010's is the higher distribution in U.S. as opposed to foreign entities. So that's just what drove the rate up. That's why we're working on comprehensive tax reform in the U.S.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is that the same tax shield you get on your cash contributions?","David James Anderson","I'm sorry?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is that the similar tax shields that you actually get on your pension cash contributions?","David James Anderson","Yes, that would be a pretty good proxy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Dave, I wanted -- just sort of package these 2 items together. Could you address sort of the progress of the restructuring and then some of the capital spending plans? I know you outlined at the end of the year a step-up in CapEx and, clearly, some of that's going to lead to either more productivity. But if you could sort of tell us where you're targeting it and update us on some of the progress with the restructuring, I'd appreciate that, please.","David James Anderson","Well, the restructuring, Howard, is on track. We go through -- just a little bit of background, as you know we go through a very thorough vetting and fuse with our businesses and roll that up in a disciplined process and review individual -- every individual project with Dave. There's a lot of dialogue, a lot of pushback, that ultimately culminates in anything that gets approved. And it means that it's in a business where there's strategic justification, it has operational merit and on the major projects, we go back and we actually review that performance and we report out that performance in terms of how we're doing relative to what we've committed. So we'll be doing in 2012, for example, reviews of major projects. The second thing is in terms of the CapEx, so you should take the first to say, that's all as you would expect, it's all working as you would expect. Relative to the CapEx, what we're looking at is a ramp-up in 2012 in terms of our plan, and that plan, if you looked that in the terms of type of projects, really, think of it as growth. What we're really doing is we're really funding, particularly in global markets, we're funding increased presence, whether it's technical centers or operating facilities or joint ventures, funding in terms of joint ventures. If you look at it by business, it's really kind of across the businesses in terms of the increases, with the greatest percentage increase coming in PMT associated with a scarcity in terms of capacity to meet global demand and the outlook for those -- for a number of the technologies in PMT.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then, while you talked about growth, might you, Mr. Cote, give us a little bit of sense of where you're targeting or what kind of projects you see for 2012 for both UOP and HPS? I think those continue to be very strong growth vehicles and is the activity as good for '12 as you've seen in '11?","David M. Cote","Yes. We won't go into any specific projects that we're addressing. But I would say, yes, the demand is still very much out there. And even though the refining industry in total only grows 2 or 3% a year, the churn is going on within that especially outside developed market is huge. And we don't see that diminishing at all. When you couple that with the new technologies that our guys have come up with like this Uniflex, that we were talking about earlier, to refine the bottom of the barrel. That's going to be even more useful to refineries that already do exist. So I just -- I think this is going to be a market that stays bullish for a while. And then all the natural gas that everybody is finding, which, as you know, we made some early plays there and I think those have been proven to be pretty smart overall. So yes, those feel very good.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So last bullet on the last page of the slide, update on progress of long-term targets already ahead of plan. You've already crossed over the top of the range in Performance Materials. Is there -- if you think about the other 3 segments, are there any that stand out as being kind of noticeably above where you expected them to be if you think about kind of the ratable improvement you need over the next 3 years to get there?","David M. Cote","We think we're pretty much on track as a company and with those -- the other 3 businesses. So Performance Materials, you're right, it did manage to get there very early. But they also had some pricing uniqueness that they were able to get last year that we're not confident is going to be able to continue on to the future. And the other businesses are going to have the kind of basic volume of the business is going to have to make that happen. So all in all, we feel we're pretty much on track.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just on the project work, it does look like the Process business is kind of back to some of its old historic strength of long ago. But you also remarked on competitive projects, and I just wonder how you feel actually about the organization's project management and making sure what your booking in the backlog is actually as profitable as you think and what's -- kind of what's going on in the pricing environment on large projects?","David M. Cote","Well, I'm pretty confident in our ability to, first of all, forecast what the profitability is going to be on a project and then to actually deliver what that's going to be. And I would say, if you went back 10 years ago, that was not a strength of ours and we did get surprised. That's one of the things that we had to fix. I feel pretty confident now. When you take a look at the big projects that we do, they pretty much come out where we think they're going to. So I'm very much okay with that. And yes, things can get more competitive. But it just means you need to decide to walk away sometimes, which we may do. In other times, you figure out how to be more competitive. So I feel pretty good, Jeff, about our ability to do that now.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just finally, on capital allocation. Obviously, you got a be mindful of pension and maybe NARCO, but what should we kind of expect for the balance over the course of the year? Is there a bolt-on pipeline or might you be in the market, picking up some stock along the way?","David M. Cote","Well, I'd say our answer is going to be boringly consistent with what we've said for the last 10 years, and that's that we'll be opportunistic about it. We want to pay a good dividend. We always have a robust pipeline of opportunities, so that you never know when one is going to come up or not. And we still think our stock is attractively priced. So we'll, as we go through the course of the year, we'll decide what the best way is to deploy that capital. Like I said, it's very boringly consistent, Jeff, which I hope becomes a strength of ours in your eyes.","Elena Doom","All right. Thank you for your participation today. I do want to turn the call back over to Dave Cote for any final comments. But as usual, I will be available throughout the day for your questions. Dave?","David M. Cote","Thanks. Well, we're pleased with our performance last year and we're encouraged by our ability to outperform again in 2012. Having great positions in good industries, the focus on One Honeywell and the continued evolution in our 5 initiatives makes us a better company every year. That continuity of purpose and strategy allows us to outperform in any economic conditions and puts us in a position where we can say, as good as it's been, the best is yet to come. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"10635":["Honeywell International, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice-President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Cynthia. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light.

And finally, as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. As I'm you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter to kick off 2016. EPS of $1.53 increased 9%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $9.5 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance. We outperformed and saw growth accelerate in Aerospace, Commercial Aftermarket and Transportation Systems, in our residential and commercial and China businesses within ACS, and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, segment margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%. We generated significant sustainable productivity in the quarter.","The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature, and we continue to reengineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture. HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated that productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in high-ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.","Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range primarily due to a combination of higher than expected sales of lower margin products like in BSD and Commercial Aviation OE, and lower sales of higher margin products like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half. We will of course continue with our disciplined cost controls focused on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions.","Our strong start and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, or up 7% to 10% year over year. Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive our performance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company, and we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D. In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full-year range.","There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company. I'd like to spend a moment on them here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio.","Honeywell remained very active on the capital allocation front in the first quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell's shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104. And we deployed another billion dollars to acquisitions. We announced and closed three deals in ACS: Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies in Security and Fire, and Mobilizer in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. As we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment.","Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our great positions in good industries. Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year to bolster our connectivity and software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, Aviaso and COM DEV. Enexis, one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell Elster to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next five years as part of the country's efforts to meet the European Union energy efficiency goals.","Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place. COM DEV, part of Defense & Space in Aero, recently announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel 3A satellite. Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide near real-time data from the satellite's measurement systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell and look forward to telling you more about our progress.","And some of you may have seen last month that Honeywell Green Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from L.A. to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% of petroleum-derived jet fuel used in-flight without any changes to the aircraft technology while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feedstock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels.","We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drives significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries, and the Power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution, and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on the business slides.","By region, core organic sales modestly declined in the Americas and increased high single-digit in Europe. In our High Growth Regions, India grew double-digit, while in China Aero and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals. Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year but up 20 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions.","The businesses are driving benefits for HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.","Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion. Non-controlling interest was also favorable year over year as anticipated given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell.","On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion dollars of shares at attractive prices which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been and we'll continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.","Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year over year. The first quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we will remain on track to our full-year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.","I'm now on slide four to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point operational improvement in the quarter, which compares well with a 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our supply chains are becoming more lean. Our back office continues to get more efficient, and there's strong collaboration across the organization to drive down our material costs and indirect spend. The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.","We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE businesses this quarter. But that overdrive as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower than expected products growth in ACS Scanning and Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.","Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.","The other three impacts you see on this slide combined for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year, as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating eight acquisitions, and are happy to report that each one is performing well and is ahead of our deal financial model.","Second, as we previewed in our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost, but either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.","Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we were able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately $1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of $1.10. So to put it into perspective, these three items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter, or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out.","I'm now on slide five summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that. Aero and PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In Aero, we continued to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher than planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced a sales shift. That is lower than anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in Scanning and Productivity Solutions, but higher than expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.","The adverse margin impact of these sales shifts offsets the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence, and restructuring. As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full-year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year, this while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Let's turn to slide six with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced five acquisitions, aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs [Strategic Business Groups], following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies. We've continued this into 2016, having already announced and closed the three additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work, and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.","Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies, each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security and fire offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets such as museums and historical buildings or facilities where continuity is critical, such as IT data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.","RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream, over the cloud, providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms. And we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.","Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings for the connected worker in sensing and productivity solutions. Movilizer's cloud platform plugs seamlessly into our customers' ERP systems and enables them to develop, deploy, and manage their workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now, and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.","Let's move to slide seven and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better than expected growth in the commercial aviation business. Aerospace recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our air transport and regional business units to provide the consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and aftermarket business. Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave Satcom sales in business and general aviation, and higher sales to OEMs and air transport and regional, partially offset by a six-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned.","As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won four of the five super midsized business jet platforms. Commercial Aviation aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better than expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in repair and overhaul activities. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spares sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning. In China, both spares and R&O sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.","Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business in particular faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. And as a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition, that's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.","Transportation Systems sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.","Let's turn to the ACS results on slide eight. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double digit in the quarter driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefit from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in Energy, Safety & Security \u2013 so the products businesses \u2013 were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service's contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. That is excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other three business units within ES&S were up this quarter on an average of 3%.","The momentum continued in Security & Fire globally with the strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single-digit reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20% with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses.","We're encouraged by the solid improvement we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter. Our selections though, where we have chosen in an RFP but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly 500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I've described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders. Well, we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. In an industry that is expected to grow at strong mid-single digits.","We're also seeing traction in the service business in HBS driven by focused investments in NPI. Overall, the HBS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects and high growth regions particularly in India.","The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives, and the impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offer and in high growth region sales marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we have received great feedback thus far on our second generation of lyric products including our water leak and freeze detective products following our launch in April.","I'm now on slide nine with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected primarily driven by strength in process solutions, a business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process solution sales grew 9% on a core organic basis driven by double digit growth in our project businesses and by higher service sales. Conversion of the global mega project wins in backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations picked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.","Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis but improved in our higher margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our insurance 360 service partnership offering which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support, and optimize performance of Honeywell process control systems.","In UOP, sales were down as expected driven by lower gas processing, catalyst, and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter and while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we have highlighted in the past.","The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. UOP's backlog was up low single digits driven by our catalyst business. Advanced materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis driven by demand for our saltless global warming products as well as higher volume in resins and chemicals. The saltless growth is accelerating even more than we had expected and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand.","In resins and chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions. PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and advanced materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence, with favorable impact of raw materials pass through in resins and chemicals, and the impact from previous restructuring actions.","I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell, total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions as one-time M&A related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%, EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66 up 7% to 10% versus 2015.","Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digits driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation and OE is expected to be up low-single-digit, with a ramp-up of key platforms in air transport and regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong engine shipments.","Commercial Aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single-digit again with an increase in the airline spare sales, improvement in BGA RMU sales and higher repair and overall activity. ATR flight hours continue to be strong, and we're also delivering higher SATCOM and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models.","Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales to the U.S. government offset by tough prior-year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business. In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single-digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first quarter performance, and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.","ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis, or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the three acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis as continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our key high growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter when we lap the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. Postal Service contract.","In Building Solutions and Distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the Americas Distribution business and the recent improvements in the HBS orders and backlog. Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.","In PMT, sales are expected to be down to 3% to 4% on both a reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter, but will still be down double-digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments. Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year.","HPS sales are expected to be up low-single- S&PS a second half digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global mega projects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation products. Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low single-digit, driven by strength in flooring products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products volumes, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in resins and chemicals.","The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, and this is driven by strong productivity, net of inflation, and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals.","Let's move to slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are a few drivers which we expect will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. We expect Aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in Aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across Commercial Aviation OE, which as you'll recall, grew high single-digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.","In ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning Water Leak Detector, part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS's continued strong performance in High Growth Regions, particularly China and India, will support continued modest second-half growth.","The majority of the improvement in the second-half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand in the refining and petrochemical segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting a robust orders performance again in the second quarter.","So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There are some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March, but overall another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016.","As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth. And total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in the reported sales reflects the incremental sales from the three new acquisitions and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately $1.10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption of course does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.","Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits, and continued proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full-year tax rate to be 26.5%.","Our pension and OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest costs as a result of our adoption of the spot rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and the UK. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution from new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million. We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter. While our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market allows.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year. And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.","Let's move to slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high-ROI CapEx, and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring. And we've again put to work a sizeable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.","We have confidence in our full-year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning cost and spending conservatively, and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareowners.","As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprises are hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance through our five-year plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of the year.","With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. Cindy, if you could, please open the line up for questioning.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, lots here, but I just wanted to get a sense, Dave, and I know you're going to hate this question, but what's the signaling, if there is any, of making Darius COO now? I'll just leave it at that. What are you telling us? Are you telling us you might be thinking about retirement and this is a transition, or are you telling us that you need this role, you need a COO-type role?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say \u2013 what I'm saying is that I think Darius is a damn good guy and I don't want to lose him. If I didn't promote him, who knows where he'd have gone?","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wish my boss would say that. All right, I'll move on. I ask this question a lot because I don't get it. What happens with the UOP catalyst business when it goes down this much? Do you get a snap back? I looked back at history and I couldn't find any real trends. How long is it going to take to convert orders to revenues? Because it seems like your backlog is there. But do things snap back, or is this a multi-quarter kind of grind its way back?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me address it a bit, and then I'll ask Darius, who used to run that business, to weigh in a bit here. It ends up being pretty lumpy, as you know, like a lot of the stuff in UOP. And we generally can tell what's going to happen because you don't get the order right away and ship it out like two weeks later, so you do have some idea. But it still ends up being pretty lumpy overall. And that's why we said that this first quarter was going to be tough for us on both growth and margins because we knew that was coming, and that was the case here. But that being said, we have a pretty good sense for the year and what happens in the second half versus this first half when it comes to catalysts, and that's what allows us to be able to be confident in what we're saying for the rest of the year. So, Darius, anything you want to add?","Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think that's right, Dave. What we saw in Q1 of 2015 was a very strong shipment quarter in terms of our catalyst portfolio. And even within that catalyst portfolio, there's variability and it was a very, I'll say, margin-accretive set of catalysts that we shipped back in Q1 2015. And in terms of being able to convert it, we can generally convert it relatively fast, certainly within a quarter or at most a quarter or two. So as Dave pointed out, it can be lumpy. We had a very strong Q1 2015 shipment and I would say at some very favorable margin rates, which we expect to get those orders back in the second half of the year.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The other thing to keep in mind here is this is our downstream business. It's serving refineries and petrochemical plants. The demand for the output from those units is very strong, and a lot of our catalysts activity has to be scheduled with customer service intervals as well. So that comes into play. And overall, I think you're right, Scott. The backlog I think speaks for itself.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congratulations, Darius.","Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just on the ACS margins, could you maybe just give us kind of a \u2013 definitely weaker than expected. I think you talked about the mix. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of more color on that bridge more precisely on what you were expecting, where it ultimately came in? And then maybe just give us a little bit of color on the one-time related deal stuff that kind of goes away either in the second quarter or over the course of the year. Because you didn't change your margin guidance for the year, and it just looks like a heck of a ramp to ultimately get there.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll talk a little bit and then turn it over to Tom. In terms of the ramp, it's no different than what we were saying back at Investor Day or back in December because this is pretty much what we expected. It was down a little bit from what we thought on guidance largely because of the mix difference as you look at what happened in the Building Systems division, which after it felt like six or seven quarters of saying the orders are there, it's going to come; it finally did, which was nice. It was a good thing to see. So this is pretty much consistent with what we've been planning for all along. And as you take a look at second-half growth for the total company, it's, as I said, largely driven by the absence of negatives than it is by any big thing that we're counting on. So, Tom?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just moving a little closer to details, Steve, the dilutive impact from margins was, from Elster and Datamax only a little bit. But it was 150 basis points or so, and that contains probably around $40 million of one-time kinds of things, but when you \u2013 and that's like the upfront inventory write-off and deal costs and so forth. So you're right; those will not be with us for the rest of the year. But that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we had given you. So if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we thought we were going to have. We had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we actually had good performance on the Commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted.","I mean, we had more sales in Distribution, more sales of Building Solutions products. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in Building Solutions. And we also had, in S&PS, a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract that we talked about, a little bit of channel softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well. So those are the puts and takes. As we said second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity. I don't think the sales \u2013 we're not planning for the \u2013 market or sales growth in BSD as we had in the first quarter. And we get more restructuring benefit as we move along. That's the way I'd characterize it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the S&PS thing being down, I mean, that should have been \u2013 that's kind of visible, right? I mean, that's something that you probably knew about earlier because it's a tough comp as opposed to a change in the business environment?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I \u2013 we certainly knew about the U.S. Postal contract completion. But when you look at the...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So then what else?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But it's a short-cycle business, and we go through indirect channels. And your visibility out on those is not much more than a few weeks, a couple weeks.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, what happened on that, to Tom's point, there were two drivers. One we knew and planned for, USPS. The second one was distributor inventory levels which declined in the quarter, and we expect will probably decline again in the second quarter before leveling out. And that one is one that we had not anticipated. It just kind of happened. But we think as \u2013 once that, as you know, that level gets to where they want it, then you get back to the growth \u2013 you get back to the end market growth again.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there something \u2013 is there an industry there that you're seeing? Is it something \u2013 it seems like a lot of the macro in inventory-related stuff has stabilized. Anything more specific than that?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we don't think so from an end market perspective. It looks more like just distributors trying to be a little bit more cautious.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question, just on the below-the-line stuff. You mentioned you're keeping your share count guidance the same, but then you said you're raising it partly because of share count dynamics. Could you just maybe clarify below the line what's changed, whether it's pension, restructuring, share count, what has helped you on the guide? Because it doesn't seem like the core profit guidance has changed very much.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, that's right. I mean, the big changes are the spot rate method on the pension side, which as we said, we fully expect to offset that impact with additional restructuring. We have eight acquisitions that we're integrating, and when we start to carry out our cost synergy plans, we'll really need to lean on that restructuring funding. So that's the \u2013 those are the major movements. The raise to the guidance is a reflection of the strong first quarter as well as the share count that we mentioned.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, all.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Dave, I think a skeptic \u2013 maybe you look at some of the segment margins over time now and this quarter, for example, even ex-M&A, and say, look, after more than a decade of almost 1,000 basis points of segment margin expansion and well past prior peak in all cases that it's just getting harder and harder and bumpier for whatever reasons, mix, et cetera. What would you say, what are the one or two things that you'd point to say, no, that's wrong, very explainable as you just went through ACS and here is why that's wrong?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","An analyst skeptic? Isn't that an oxymoron? That's, that's....","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","We're paid to be skeptics, not cynics, Dave.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, we forecasted this was going to happen in the first quarter. And, yes, okay, we didn't beat it by 10 basis points, but we're certainly within the realm of reasonability. And if you take a look at the total years, quarters are a little more difficult, let's say, you have things move always perfectly smoothly, because you have things like UOP that just cause things not to be perfectly smooth. On a total year basis, there's \u2013 this is going to continue. And it's not so much where you're coming from and the 1,000 basis points, yeah, that's quite nice. But there's at least another 300 basis points or 400 basis points left to go if we take a look versus our high margin rate peers and we look at the industries that we're in and how others do in that industry. So this is going to keep going. It's not going to change.","At some point, we will have to say, yes, we are the highest in the industry, and we can't keep talking about our margin rate growth story. But it's going to keep going. HOS Gold hasn't finished. The whole idea of being able to grow sales and hold fixed costs constant, those are still very real. And there's still a lot of juice left for functional transformation. There's still a lot left there. Yes, Tom, go ahead.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If I could add, the other thing I would point to, Steve, is the unspent restructuring that we have. It's well over $300 million, and that will continue to replenish itself. We have requests for way more than we can fund every quarter, and we think that'll help it. The other thing is these acquisitions, I said we're integrating eight acquisitions. And when you look at the weighted averaging margin rate of those acquisitions for the first quarter, it's less than 10%. So that's diluting down our portfolio. So as we continue to integrate those and bring those in, that's going to be a big driver for us as well.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Very helpful, thanks. And, Dave, what are you currently thinking in terms of M&A again? I know you get this question all the time in size. And I guess also just given a lot of investor discussions, are there any circumstances under which you'd actually revisit your UTX bid?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're starting with the second one, first. No. It's done. It's past. It had its time, and that time is gone. The \u2013 on the first one, while it's the same question, it's also the same answer. It depends. You know, we work an active pipeline. You never know when stuff's going to hit. And sometimes and we've been really fortunate this past six, nine months with a bunch of things that we were able to bring to fruition. Who knows? The rest of the year, there could be another 10, or it could be zero. And we're just going to continue to be smart about it. I still do the integration reviews like we've talked about in the past. We're just as disciplined as we ever were. If something makes sense, we'll do it. If we can't find stuff that makes sense, we won't. I don't mind being out of the market for a while and seeing what develops. We're going to stay sharp.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm sure you have a lot of folks in the queue, so I'll pass it on. Thanks.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Steve. See you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just more a general question. A lot of conversations with investors about sort of global PMIs bottoming and bouncing off the bottom. What are you seeing? Is the world truly be accelerating as you look at your business? And when are we going to start seeing it in numbers? Thank you.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm hopeful that there is a global economic rebound, but we're certainly not going to count on it. If there was any region that surprised me in this past quarter, it was Europe did a lot better than I expected. I don't know if this is just a one-time bounce or something that's going to stay consistent, but I was quite encouraged by seeing that. It was a nice surprise. I mean, we'll see how much that turns into something. But right now, we're going to stay with this whole idea that this is a slow growth global environment and it's just the smart way to plan. And you see that reflected in how we are forecasting the second quarter and how we're forecasting the total year. I just don't think there's any percentage right now on being bullish about it. If it happens, great. I think there's a greater chance it happens than there is that it doesn't. But that being said, I don't see any percentage in being bullish about it.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up question, the dollar has been going up for years. And at the end, a lot of companies, you included, set up the hedging structure. And as this dollar trade is unwinding; A, how are you thinking about hedging in outer years; and B, other than hedging a weaker dollar, how does it impact your strategy?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It doesn't really impact our strategy all that much because we have never really changed the way we did it. We've always tried to match cost and revenue as best we can, so I want to be producing in the markets where I'm selling. And as a result of that, I think it's put us in a pretty good position where we don't get out of whack with any competitor because of a currency mismatch.","When it comes to the translation question, that's a separate one. We might consider taking some exposure off the table this year and next as we contemplate what could happen, especially as you look at Brexit and the possibilities there. But by and large, I don't feel as negative as I did about currency as I did, say, a year or two ago.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. A couple, maybe actually one for Darius since he's on the line. I just seen this morning that Grace is buying BASF's Catalysts business today. I just wonder if you could speak whether that was on your radar screen and maybe more generally, do you see M&A opportunities in that space for UOP or kind of related assets in that area?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously as usual, we're not going to comment on specific targets. So quick learning from Dave. But obviously, the catalysts space is interesting to us. It's something that obviously is core to what UOP does, and I would just say that that's an area that, you know, it's something that we've been looking at both organically and if the right opportunity presents itself, it's probably something that we'd be open to as w00ell. But clearly a space that's of interest to us.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And then, Tom, just on tax, Honeywell for years has had a very sophisticated tax planning effort, solving to 26.5% almost precisely year after year. Is there anything in what the Treasury said a couple weeks ago when they were aiming at inversions that spills over and increases the risk to your tax planning strategies?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","First of all, my tax director is going to be thrilled that you referred to him as sophisticated. That's going to be a new one.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a first for him.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just kidding. Of course, Jeff, we're not an inverted company, Jeff, as you know. But the new rules do apply to U.S. multinationals as well, and there are specific criteria that intercompany loans are required to meet in order to be treated as debt as opposed to equity. We're currently assessing all of our intercompany loans against these criteria. We'll likely be required to have more extensive documentation placed on our loans, and it may have an impact on our ability to pool our cash globally as well. We're currently assessing that. But otherwise, we're not expecting a material impact, including in our ability to do M&A and including in our foreign operations.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks, and just one more quick one, if I could. We're all just trying to get all the I's dotted on margins, as you can see on this call. Just the OEM payments for the year, if you gave that previously, I don't recall. Could you share that with us just so we have that dialed in?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, it's a little bit over $200 million for the year.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Year on year, I think.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Year on year, $200 million.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you've seen any change in customer buying behavior in the ATR Aero aftermarket. we hear a lot about pooling of parts and part-outs. I'm wondering if you're seeing any of that because the numbers don't suggest it.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, those phenomena, both of those are real. And you're seeing the consolidation more in China, I'd say, than anyplace else. And the parting-out is real, and we referenced it ourselves in previous announcements. That being said, those are a couple of headwinds, but there are also tailwinds. And that's flight hours, for example, where people are continuing to fly and that's always good. And it more than offsets the impact from those other items.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And in China, your spares were up quite a bit. Is there any \u2013 what do you think is actually driving that? Is it a restock? What's going on there?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say it comes back to flight hours again. They fly a lot. And that's really \u2013 I've said many times the biggest Aerospace driver we have is flight hours. And it's not tied to OEM schedules or airline profitability or any of that generally. The long-term trend is going to be driven by flight hours. If they're flying, everything ends up working out. Whatever short-term disruptions or benefits, whatever you're seeing, over time flight hours ends up being the driver. Flight hours continue to climb, and that's a good phenomenon for us.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'd also add that when you look back at the first quarter of 2015, there were unusually low aftermarket sales, I think because of some of the factors you had mentioned, Gautam, and I think we'll continue to see the impacts of that, as Dave said. But overall for the full year, the flight hours are going to be what drives our aftermarket in China.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just to follow up on Jeff's question on the OEM preproduction payments, do you have any preliminary sense for what they might be in 2017?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the level will be similar in total to 2016, so flat year over year.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then it starts dropping.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And then it should recede in the years after that.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And last one, can you quantify the USPS headwind for us, quarter over quarter what the decline has been?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In general, that's not the kind of specifics we'd share. We would say that \u2013 like we said, we knew about some of it. We did not know about the distributor side of it. So that was a surprise. But like any other inventory reduction, that corrects itself over time.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right, thank you very much.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for running a bit late here as well. Darius, congratulations on the role, fantastic.","Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So we've spent a lot of time talking about catalysts, so I apologize for another question here, but it is a big swing between first half and second half. Typically, how much visibility do you have on catalyst bed reloads? Is it three months? Is it six months? And how much variability do you have once you have a job in the backlog? Typically, how much variability is there and the timing of that? I can't imagine it's much, but maybe just comment on that, please.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a mixture. There's stuff that we know about a long time ahead because some customers place orders a long time ahead. Others don't. But, Darius, you'd know better than me.","Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think when it comes to the second part of your question, which is once it's in the backlog, we can produce it fairly quickly, typically within three months. So I think the cycle, the conversion cycle time from booking to revenue is relatively short.","In terms of visibility as to when the orders come in, frankly the visibility isn't great. It's a bit of a random function. Tom referred to this earlier about one of the fundamental things that's going on; this is actually a pretty good time for refiners. So what we're seeing is that refiners are actually putting off their turnarounds, which they're going to have to occur at some point. When that's going to happen, that's not really certain. But I would say overall, the catalyst booking pattern is somewhat unpredictable.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So the second half view is best efforts, but not locked in. it's mainly (1:02:36), okay. And then obviously, you're getting beaten up a little bit on margin this quarter. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts for the OE, support payments and the FX hedge. I guess the overall margin strength given those two headwinds is pretty extraordinary but just, Tom, maybe just comment on the hedge, the euro hedge. And if by some miracle the euro did go to $1.24 by year end, that's still a benefit to your guide net-net, but obviously, they will tax your margins somewhat. Is that the way to think about it?","[005YK8-E Tom Szlosek]: No. If you recall, Nigel, at the beginning of \u2013 towards the tail end of last year, we basically hedged the euro, our euro-based profits, is the way to think about it. So they're hedged at about $1.10.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At the income level.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right, the profits are. The movement in our guidance was on reported sales. So we've never hedged it at the sales line level. So we do see the variability if the U.S. dollar goes to \u2013 if we go to $1.24 in your scenario, then yes, we'd have more sales, but our margins would be the same, so that would have an impact on the margin rates.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's why we break out the difference between operational and all the other items on the margin rate curve.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a quick one on the inventories. The build in inventories, is that driven by the Aero build cycle?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You've got a couple things going on in inventories, and I'd say the biggest thing is we're continuing to ramp up for flooring products. We've got significant pickup in, as we said, in second half there. And the other thing is the M&A. I mean, more than half of it is, of the inventory increase, is from the acquisitions that we've done.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Of course. Yeah, okay. Thanks, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Dave, the TS business seemed to pick up in 2Q. Can you talk about the improvement a little bit more? How did commercial vehicles do in the quarter? Is it just easier comparisons there being in take\/hold? And can you sustain the mid-single-digit growth that you're seeing going forward?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Commercial is still tough on the TS side. What you're seeing more were the benefits of the wins in the passenger vehicle side.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's easy. And then, Dave, just \u2013 I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Can you talk about your organic growth guidance in 2Q? There's the 1% growth you had in 1Q. Is anything getting worse in the portfolio in Aero and ACS that leads to lower growth? Or is it just conservatism and you're not forecasting the BSD accelerated growth that you saw in the quarter?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say it's more a case where we want to stay careful. So yeah, there's nothing that says there's a disaster coming in the second quarter or anything like that. We're just \u2013 we want to make sure that we stay conservative, and hopefully, the first quarter performance continues on organic growth, but we'd hate like hell to count on it and not have it happen. And I'd rather have it be the other way around.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate it.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And that is all the time that we have for today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Cote, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We were quite pleased to outperform again this quarter, and what we accomplished on organic sales growth, beating our commitment and the productivity generated to offset the known headwinds gives us the confidence to raise the low end of our EPS guidance by $0.10. We're encouraged by what we're accomplishing this year and next. And of course, we all hope that you feel the same way. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. We want you to note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","So this morning, we're going to review our financial results for the second quarter of 2012, as well as share with you our guidance for the remainder of the year. And, of course, we'll allow time for your questions at the end.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be able to say again that Honeywell had another terrific quarter, capping off a strong first half. We had a nice earnings increase on modest sales growth and it was driven by solid margin expansion. Margins expanded about 150 basis points or 80 basis points when you exclude the absence of prior year payments to BGA customers, and that gave us a tailwind this year. That increase in margins, though, reflects our continued focus on driving productivity from our key process initiatives, that conservative planning assumptions and the proactive restructuring, all while continuing to invest for the future.","Sales were $9.4 billion, representing 4% reported annual organic growth on top of good growth last year. This performance in a more challenging macro environment underscores the value of the diversity of opportunity across our businesses: Short- and long-cycle exposure, our products and services and mix of U.S. and rest of world geographies.","As expected, our short-cycle businesses posted slower growth this quarter, with declines in Europe and slower growth in China. However, our long-cycle businesses, namely Commercial Aerospace and UOP, continued with strong performance.","Earnings per share of $1.14 was up 12% year-over-year, 14% on a continuing ops basis, that was above the high end of our guidance range. Cash was also strong, having generated over $1 billion of free cash flow prior to pension contributions, and that reflects 115% net income conversion.","And as I mentioned earlier, we did this while also investing for the future. We continue to ramp R&D and CapEx investments, which will continue to drive future growth. We also funded approximately $25 million in net restructuring in the quarter or approximately $50 million on a gross basis. That brings gross year-to-date restructuring funded through operations to almost $80 million, adding to the existing opportunity of already committed projects that Dave will take you through further later.","As we all know, the macroeconomic landscape is uncertain and that\u2019s at best. However, we continue to expect more of the same. We're going to build on our execution track record, and in Europe, we expect continued softness in our short-cycle businesses, specifically ACS and Transportation Systems. However, with our balanced portfolio of short and long-cycle businesses, that helping to mitigate these near-term trends, as Europe is roughly flat on an organic basis year-to-date.","Meanwhile, the Americas is holding up well, and the indicators we're tracking are still positive. The same is true in China with a modest uptick in our short-cycle businesses, helping to drive double-digit growth again in the quarter.","Overall, we feel good about the diversified nature and regional mix of the portfolio, benefiting from our Great Positions in Good Industries globally.","With all that in mind, we've outlined our second half planning framework, capturing the key variables that comprise the low, mid and high ends of our new guidance range.","Dave will walk you through more of the details shortly, but at a high level, we're raising the low end of guidance by $0.05. While keeping the high end unchanged, making our new EPS guidance range $4.40 to $4.55. This is, of course, supported by the strong performance we saw in the first half and a balanced view of the risks and opportunities in the second half.","Turning to 2013, who knows what happens on a macroeconomic basis. However, everything out there suggests that continued conservative planning is best. We're positioning ourselves for another tough economic landscape while staying focused on the things that are within our control. That means continuing to execute on our key strategies for growth, sustaining our investments in new products and technologies, controlling our fixed costs through OEF, or organization effectiveness, and making sure we deliver the savings from the roughly $400 million in restructuring projects that are still in process that we funded over the last couple of years. These projects are estimated to deliver over $125 million of incremental savings next year, and of course, we'll continue to be cautious about adding people back globally.","And as we highlighted in our March Investor Conference, we've made margin growth a bigger element of how we incentivize our people, so everyone's focused on it and we're delivering on it. Honeywell demonstrated in the last downturn that we're a company that executes well even in a tough macro environment, and we're doing it again this time. Segment margins are expanding more than we initially expected at the beginning of the year despite slower sales growth.","For 2012 and '13, we have focused on margin expansion as key to earnings growth as a way to leverage slower sales growth in a tough macro environment. So with sharp execution, benefits from seat planning and productivity initiatives, the tailwinds from proactive restructuring funding and acquisition accretion will work to offset low global growth. And that will contribute to the company's outperformance again in 2013.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David James Anderson","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. And thanks again for your participation in this morning's call. I'm going to take you through the summary financial results, starting on Slide #4. As you can see, the businesses have done a really nice job of managing things within their control and the results that Dave highlighted and are shown on this slide really reflect that. The revenues of $9.4 billion were up 4% at the lower end of the guidance range, driven in large part by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.","Regionally, we saw good organic growth in the Americas of 5% on an organic basis. Europe was roughly flat. China was up 12%. And as everyone knows and has been experiencing, the Europe macro headwinds have been challenging. But Honeywell's balanced mix of long-cycle exposure is clearly contributing to the stability that we're having in Europe again in the second quarter.","The segment profits for the company was up an impressive 15%. Segment margins expanded 150 basis points to 15.8%, with expansion in 3 out of our 4 business segments. It represents approximately 55% revenue conversion for the quarter on our reported basis. And if we adjusted for last year's Aero launch contribution and the favorability this year compared to that same event last year, we actually had 43% revenue conversion in the quarter. Tremendous productivity, disciplined cost controls in a slower growth environment.","Now below the line in taxes, we're largely as expected, we funded approximately $25 million, as Dave said, in net restructuring projects in the quarter, which is going to benefit us in 2013. And in a few minutes, I'll walk you through an analysis of our proactive restructuring actions that we've taken since 2009. Our earnings per share of $1.14 were above the high end of our guidance, representing a 14% increase on a continuing operations basis.","And finally, free cash flow of just over $1 billion, reflecting 115% free cash flow conversion, a solid result for the quarter. Working capital contributed to year-over-year cash growth, which partially offset higher capital spending.","So let's now go to Slide 5, start with the businesses with Aerospace. Sales in Aero were up 8%, 4% organic excluding the impact of last year's BGA launch payments. And as expected, we continue to see good growth in the Commercial businesses, partially offset by manageable declines in defense. The Commercial OE sales were up 38% in the quarter, 16% organic if you exclude the EMS acquisition, as well as the OE payments. The increases were particularly strong in BGA at 25% organic, driven by continued healthy demand in the mid to the large cabin aircraft segment, where as you know Honeywell has an outsized share of content. And on the ATR side, we saw the benefits of growth in both Boeing and Airbus deliveries, resulting from the ongoing ramp in production rates.","Commercial aftermarket sales in total were up 9%, driven by strong spares growth, as well as growth in the Repair & Overhaul business. And in the quarter, we saw our highest quarterly number of BGA spares volumes with a record number of scheduled engine events.","Couple other subpoints relative to the commercial aftermarket. As expected, the ATR aftermarket is beginning to recouple the flight hours, sales growth roughly half the pace of the first quarter and the second quarter, although we still saw more than 2x flight hour growth in our revenue growth in the second quarter.","So with slower flight hour growth year-over-year and spares and R&O volumes now above the prior peak, there's clear evidence that the restocking momentum that we experienced over the last year has begun to subside. And in the second half, consistent with what we've told you earlier, we expect the ATR aftermarket sales to recouple the flight hour growth, and that flight hour growth, we expect to be in the range of up 2.5% to 3.5% in the second half.","On the BGA side, on the Business and General Aviation side, the aftermarket growth is also expected to moderate from high teens to high single digits to low double digit in the second half, following 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit increases in spares activities and 7 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth for BGA R&O.","On the Defense and Space side, sales were down 4% in the quarter. TIGER international sales and the addition of EMS volumes partially offset TIGER program completion and lower T55 engine sales. And again, this is playing out exactly as we communicated to you and as we guided to you.","We're now anticipating D&S sales to be down approximately 4% for the year, better than previously expected, as the business continues to execute very well on incremental pursuits both in the U.S. and particularly internationally.","Aerospace margins expanded 260 basis points to 18.6% in the second quarter, even when you exclude the impact of the absence of last year's launch payments, margins expanded 50 basis points approximately, driven by commercial volume growth, price and productivity net of inflation, while continuing to ramp investment in R&D to support future growth.","So with the highlights of Aero, let's now turn to ACS, Slide #6. Sales for ACS were $4 billion in the quarter, up 2% on a reported basis, 4% organic, driven by volume growth and favorable impact of acquisitions, primarily EMS, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Now the top line performance was largely as expected with good growth in the long-cycle businesses of ACS, offsetting the slower growth in the short-cycle businesses of Energy, Safety and Security, if you will, ESS. Now as a reminder, ACS represents about 50% of Honeywell's total European exposure, and while we've seen some variability month-to-month in the short-cycle, we continue to convert the long-cycle backlog of both Process and Building Solutions, which is resulting in roughly flat organic sales for the segment in the quarter in Europe.","Now a little bit of highlights for each of the businesses. ESS, up 1% organic, reflecting continued solid growth in Security and Scanning and Mobility, largely offset by lower sales in ECC, S&C and also our Safety Products, driven by weaker overall end markets in Europe. Now we expect more of the same for ESS in the second half but with the benefit of better comps, given the profile of the second half of 2011.","HPS sales were up 8% organically. Solid growth across most regions, particularly the Americas and Middle East. New business activity in HPS was also strong. We saw orders and backlog both up 10% organically in the quarter. For BSD, that is the Building Solutions & Distribution business, sales were up 6% organically. That was driven by strong backlog conversion globally. And also America's fire and security distribution sales, which were partially offset by slower growth in energy and commercial retrofit projects here in the U.S.","Now turning to margins. ACS expanded margins 50 basis points in the quarter to 13.3%, 35% sales conversion, driven by productivity improvements, namely benefits from prior period repositioning actions, disciplined cost control, acquisition integration benefits, particularly those acquisition integration benefits driven by EMS. So very good conversion, very good margin expansion for ACS in the quarter in the face of some challenging macros, particularly European short-cycle macros.","Now Slide 7, Performance Materials & Technologies. Revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% recorded, 4% organic, led by UOP and Resins & Chemicals. Record segment profit and margins for PMT, 22.6% operating margin in the quarter. UOP continues to execute against record backlog with favorable industry conditions globally. And as expected, UOP saw more measured growth in the quarter, with sales up 10% year-over-year supported by higher licensing activity, partially offset by lower refining catalysts sales. Further, we continue to see robust orders at UOP. They were up strong double digits in the quarter, providing further foundation for future growth. However, we anticipate, and this is very important and consistent with our prior guidance, that year-over-year sales in the second half for UOP are going to further temper as we lap more difficult comps due to the large catalyst shipments that we had last year that don't repeat this year and, of course, the completion of the Petrobras FEED portion of the contract. And again, as a reminder, UOP revenues in the second half of 2011, up 36% in the third quarter, up 36% in the fourth quarter. So very, very tough comps.","Now Advanced Materials for PMT performed very well despite strong competitive pressures globally and the regional economic headwinds, particularly Europe and Asia, offset by strong growth in the U.S. Sales for Advanced Materials were up 10% reported, roughly flat organically in the quarter. Plant execution was strong across the board. R&C benefited from higher ammonium sulfate sales. And also Caprolactam volumes were strong despite softer market conditions in China. Now weaker end demand in Europe and Asia contributed to lower sales in Fluorines, which was partially offset by more favorable sales in the Americas. And overall for the second half, we expect Advanced Materials' year-over-year sales to improve, again, largely here driven by comps, in this case, easier comps in the second half 2011, setting up for a little bit of growth in 2012.","So overall, a really great quarter for PMT. Record profit margins despite the headwinds from the phenol plant acquisition and also from R&C pricing. Plant reliability has been very good. PMD has been -- PMT has been actively working on executing high-value growth opportunities as we look to expand capacity and capability across a number of product lines.","With that, let's go to Transportation Systems, Slide #8. Now Transportation sales were $900 million in the quarter, down 9% reported, 1% organic, with growth significantly impacted by a lower European -- euro, rather, exchange rate. It represents solid performance for Transportation in the face of challenging European macro headwinds, including EU light vehicle production was -- which was down in the range of 10% in the quarter. And also continued weak automotive sales in aftermarket conditions in that market.","Turbo sales were down slightly on an organic basis versus last year. New launches, including higher Turbo gas penetration in North America, allowed us to perform well in what has become a difficult environment for this business. Regionally, Europe was down 7% organic. China was also down again as a result of lower commercial vehicle sales, although we think we've seen the end of the CVD stocking in China. We saw a sequential growth in the second quarter over the first. We also saw good performance in the U.S., up 16% organic, as well as strength in Japan and India.","Segment margins for TS were 12.7%, down only 30 basis points, as material and HOS productivity levers more than offset in -- by inflation and the impact of ongoing projects to drive operational improvement in the Friction business.","So now let's turn to Slide 9, where we want to give you a minute to just -- to give you an update on our restructuring progress, which was one of the big focus areas, as you know, over the last few years, particularly last year as we deployed the CPG gain.","On Slide #9, this is a chart that highlights the over $800 million of restructuring that we've done and funded on a proactive basis since 2009 and provides important insights on the geography and the status of the projects as we plan for the second half of this year and look forward to 2013. Now starting with the regional view on the far left side, you can see Europe has been the recipient of a significant portion of the restructuring dollars over this time period, representing roughly 55% of the funding pool. This has and will continue to better position Honeywell for the current economic situation. It really does put us in a position to significantly improve the cost structure going forward.","And as Dave mentioned earlier, we funded an additional roughly $80 million gross in new restructuring projects in the first half of this year. These actions were funded through operations. However, the majority of the actions taken since 2009, as you recall, have been funded via one-time gains.","It's also important to point out that a large number of these projects, and that's really the second bar on the graph, are still ongoing, many of which are in Europe and somewhat longer paybacks as a result. So we expect approximately $150 million in incremental restructuring benefits in 2012, no change there. And on a preliminary basis, we see approximately $125 million of incremental savings in 2013 from projects that have already been funded. So a good demonstration of the proactive cost management and fee planning for the future that will help us drive margin expansion and earnings growth over the coming years.","With that background on the restructuring, let's turn to Slide 10 and preview our expectations for the upcoming third quarter. In Aerospace, we expect continued good growth in the Commercial OE and aftermarket, partially offset by modest declines in Defense and Space. And we expect the ATR aftermarket to track slightly ahead of utilization rates as we lap more difficult comps in 2011.","In ACS, for the third quarter, we expect a modest uptick in ESS driven by a better year-over-year comps coupled with continued good growth in Process Solutions and BSD as they continue to convert on strong backlogs. We expect a sequentially weaker third quarter in PMT, driven by the normal flooring seasonality, lower R&C pricing and as we mentioned earlier, UOP timing.","Finally, TS is expected to have another tough quarter, driven by euro exchange headwinds and lower EU light vehicle production declines, partially offset by continued good growth in the Americas, as well as the benefit of new launches. So in total, we're planning for sales in the third quarter for Honeywell to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, up 1% to 3% reported, up 4% to 6% excluding foreign exchange, so similar to what we saw in terms of our actual results in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 11. What we've shown here is a comparison now of the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2012, and we've done this given the complexity of last year's gain and gain deployment geography. So just a little bit of background again on this slide. We want to remind you of these geography challenges today in advance. So as you prepare your analysis of the third quarter and as the reported V% or income from continuing ops and net income are actually reported in October, it's going to give you a better basis to understand those results. So let's go through the highlights of this slide.","First of all, you recall that in the third quarter of 2011, we had $177 million gain on an after tax basis related to the gain on the sale of CPG reported, and that was reported in discontinued operations. You can see it down in the chart in the both the first and second columns, in terms of the income from discontinued ops in the first column. And you'll see that deployment of that in the second column. I'll explain that in just a moment. We also had a sizable both have gains in the third quarter of last year, which was reported in continuing ops. So both importantly, we're fully deployed in continuing ops as you can see in the center column.","So the repositioning and other actions, which also included a small amount of redeployment in the -- into segment profit, which was related to employee health savings account funding. That was about $30 million. This resulted -- the total of all these actions, the gains and the redeployment, resulted in no impact to EPS in 2011 other than the tax favorability that was generated in the tax rate, which is about $30 million or a $0.04 benefit, which was offset then in the fourth quarter of 2011.","So moving to the right, looking at the operating performance in the third column, you can see that the net income of $832 million and EPS of $1.06 on an adjusted operating basis provide the basis for comparison purposes when you look at our reported numbers, our guided numbers and then eventually our reported numbers for 2012. So now our third quarter 2012 EPS range guidance is $1.10 to $1.15, so that reflects 4% to 8% growth in the operating earnings on sales growth of guidance of 1% to 3% reported. And again, the geography challenges presenting today in advance, so you can prepare your analysis. We\u2019re clearly available to talk to you about this and to provide more color, more visibility, more transparency on this if you need it as you prepare your views of the third quarter for Honeywell.","Slide #12. Let's now go to the 2012 financial guidance summary. With the first half of the year behind us, we've revised our full year guidance for 2012 on Slide 12, reflecting the strength of our first half results and also what remains for the year. Here's the highlights. While we expect to have continued foreign exchange headwinds in the second half, we'll have some disparity to a normal EPS linearity due to the tax rate differences that we've had quarter-over-quarter this year versus last year, we're raising our earnings per share outlook for the year. Let's review some of the highlights.","We now expect sales to be in the range of $37.8 billion to $38.4 billion, up 3% to 5% on a reported basis, 4% to 6% organic. This reflects an adjustment of approximately $200 million attributed to euro foreign exchange headwinds as we've now incorporated lower euro assumption of EUR 1.25 in our outlook at the midpoint. Now despite the adjustment to sales for the full year, we anticipate segment margins in the range of 15.4% to 15.6% above our previous estimate, driven by continued strong sales conversion and disciplined cost controls. And as Dave referenced earlier, we're expecting EPS in the range of $4.40 to $4.55, which reflects an increase of $0.05 on the low end of our previous guidance. So on a continuing ops basis adjusted for CPG, we see earnings up in 2012 full year 10% to 14%. No change to free cash flow planning. We're planning conversion now for -- still for 100% of net income, excluding any pension contributions or NARCO-related payments.","We think our guidance demonstrates our confidence and the ability of Honeywell to execute in this environment, as well as it represents, we believe, top-tier performance among our peer group.","Not much new relative to our second half assumptions, but for D&S, which is tracking ahead of previous expectations, we now expect that down 4% to 5% in the second half versus down 5% to 7% previously.","Let's take a couple of minutes now on Slide 13 to walk through some of the key sensitivities impacting the second half outlook, and therefore, the full year guidance. So what we've set out on Slide 13 is the highlight of some of the second half factors that would cause us to come in above or below the midpoint of our guidance range. We think the midpoint reflects the reality of the environment we're in today, in effect the base case assumptions that we're using. And noting that at the end of the first half, we're clearly at different stages, with some things running ahead of expectations, like UOP, and other things running slightly behind, like Transportation Systems, with harder, tougher-than-expected European macros.","So there's no telling exactly how it's going to play out, as Dave said, how we're taking collectively, we think we've given you a relevant framing of the key drivers including the items on the high end where we -- where certainly any one of them is very possible despite the macro environment.","So starting with the commercial aftermarket for Aerospace, what we've said is we expect that growth to moderate in the second half as we recouple the flight hours. We've seen some slowing growth in ATR flight hours year-to-date. We're not expecting a further slowing, so the outlook here depends on how fast that recoupling occurs. Further, we've seen strong BGA aftermarket performance, driven by record engine maintenance events year-to-date and RMU sales over the past several quarters. Again, we're expecting growth there to slow in BGA aftermarket based on more difficult comps, although the timing and the rate of that is still unclear.","UOP, as you know, is a big needle mover. Performance has been stronger than expected year-to-date. However, we know events can be lumpy with the timing of a few shipments being a significant swing factor. The other area we're watching closely in PMT is Caprolactam pricing, as we've seen pricing come in since the peak last year, driven by softening global demand. This is something that moves -- can move around a bit, so we've included here as a key driver. And finally, as you can see, a pretty wide range for the euro, which we think is prudent, centering on the midpoint of EUR 1.25. But, again, sort of who knows on that, but we think that's a relevant range for planning purposes.","So with all the headlines out there, it's easy to look on the downside, but at the same time, we want to be realistic about the strength of execution that we've had and also some of the highlights and strong points that we're seeing in our businesses. So with all the puts and takes considered, we think this represents a balanced view of the remainder of the year, and as Dave mentioned earlier, we'll continue to leverage the cost side but remaining disciplined, as well as overall flexible.","So finally, let me just make a couple of summary points before turning it back over to Elena for Q&A. Obviously, a strong start to the year for Honeywell. Second quarter performance again ahead of expectations, adding to our performance track record. However, it's not to say this wasn't challenging, with a number of our short-cycle businesses continuing to be -- to face headwinds, particularly in Europe. And we expect this environment to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2013.","The good news, though, is that the Honeywell playbook is clearly working. All of the businesses demonstrated strong operating leverage, outperforming their industries because they were well positioned, having to continue to invest in growth and productivity in both the previous downturn and the subsequent recovery. And clearly, those investments are paying out. We're going to make sure we stay flexible. We're working with our business leaders to ensure we have a plan for both the downside and the upside scenarios. The restructuring actions that I've highlighted are going to continue to be a big theme, addressing the cost side of the equation, and as we showed you with the healthy number of projects that we're still executing on, that will deliver benefits in the second half of 2012 and big benefits in 2013.","And again, as Dave said, we're in the process of setting the stage for 2013. Importantly, we've got a forecast backlog for the year end this year of over $15 billion, slightly higher than where we ended 2011 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, which clearly implies another healthy growth year in our long-cycle businesses in 2013. And meanwhile, we continue to plan for a tough macro environment enduring in 2013, with global growth around 2%. However, we're confident with our strong global franchises, our balanced portfolio, our focused cost discipline, we're going to continue to outperform again.","So with that, let me turn it over to Elena for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Dave. Stephanie, if you can open the line, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co.

I mean, have you seen things get worse in the last month or 2?","David M. Cote","I would say it's been pretty consistent, Shannon, in terms of the rate of change there. In Turbo, we saw what I call, Dave, was a fairly just steady erosion of the order rates but in line really with what we expected. So Shannon, I would say really, it's kind of played out as we expected, as we talked to you at the end of the first quarter.","David James Anderson","We've -- we never expected much, as you know, Shannon. And fortunately, we planned for it. Unfortunately, it worked just the way we expected.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- one of your low end components of the guidance framework, I mean, you talked about project delays as a risk at UOP. Either there or, I guess, elsewhere, have you seen any evidence as people kind of putting things on hold given the current macro and how was that factored in?","David M. Cote","No, not yet. But we certainly don't want to preclude the possibility that it could happen, so we just wanted to factor that into our thinking. But we haven't seen it yet.","David James Anderson","We're seeing -- Shannon, just to add to Dave's point, we've seen continued strong activity. I have referenced the strong orders and backlog for UOP. So knock on wood, those projects will be financed, and we'll execute against those. But the overall macros continue to be very favorable in that business.","David M. Cote","The new stuff that they've been developing helps also. I mean, you've heard Andreas talk about some of the wins that we've been able to have. I mean, the new technologies are making a big difference here.","Elena Doom","Maybe just the build on that, the book-to-bill ratio at the end of the second quarter was 1.6, so record backlog at UOP of $2.1 million.","David James Anderson","And you're hosting...","Elena Doom","UOP Investor Day.","David James Anderson","UOP. Was that August 1 and 2?","Elena Doom","Yes.","David James Anderson","Good.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And are you seeing sort of similar positive trends in the Process business?","David M. Cote","Process backlog is also doing well.","Elena Doom","Up 10% from a year-over-year basis organically.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the orders too look good?","Elena Doom","Yes. Orders up 10% as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Dave, you mentioned that margins are trending better-than-expected. And obviously, a lot of what you've been doing to improve margins has been ongoing for a while, the restructuring, now the comp change. Is there anything in particular, though, that's jumping out to you that's actually driving the better performance? Is it better drop through on restructuring? Is it mix? Is there -- is it just everybody's pulling the orders the same way better than they used to? Is there anything that kind of stands out?","David M. Cote","I'd point to 2 things. One is we're doing the stuff that we always did, and a lot of that seed planting finally does come to roost at some point, whether it's the restructuring work that you've done, the new higher margin products that we've invested in. I mean, that all works. But the second thing is, I would say having the -- putting in the growth plan the way we did and making margin rate one of the components of it, that certainly helped to get everybody's attention and focus even more on a lot of that, again making sure that we got the results of all that seed planting that we did. And of course, the important thing to do is make sure that we're still investing for the future, doing that seed planting that's going to make sure that we make not just this year, but next year, the year after, et cetera. So I think all of that together helped to really just kind of take it up a notch.","Elena Doom","If I could add, for PMT, I think we did see some favorable mix in UOP driven by some record-level licensing and stronger petrochemical catalyst sales in the quarter, which contributed nicely to the margin upside.","David M. Cote","But I would say in terms of the fundamental changes, Jeff, I think the things I was referencing are the overall drivers and why you can continue to expect it.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right, that's encouraging. Can you elaborate a little bit on the comment on China? Everybody's really kind of reading the tea leaves here for any sign of stabilization in our inflection one way or the other. How convincing was it and -- or important was it in your view and what kind of follow-through are you seeing?","David M. Cote","Well, for us, China for us, as you know, has been a focal point for 10 years. And we -- I think we started off from a weaker position, as you know, but we've been accelerating rapidly. And we've got about 12,000 people there now, with the opportunity for it to just continue growing. Starting with the macroeconomic side, yes, they are going through some difficulties now. But at the end of the day, GDP is still growing pretty well and we're able to, given our low shares, I think, continue to just grow very well. And you saw it in the first quarter, second quarter, we expect that'll continue. I'm one of the guys who believes that China is going to continue to make the right decisions. They'll have their ups and downs, of course. They're kind of going through their down now. But overall, we expect that China's going to continue to do well, and that we'll do well within that macroeconomic framework that they're developing. And I think you've got to bet on them. Historically, they've made the right decisions. And I think you'd continue to see them doing that now, whether it's how they talk about the SOEs, what they talk about in banking, what they try to do to manage the real estate inflation that they've seen. I think you should bet on them, not against them.","David James Anderson","Just to add a little bit, given the importance of it. Just -- Jeff, just a couple of numbers, which I think help. We had mentioned, David mentioned, the growth that we experienced in the second quarter, 12% organic. It's 14% for the first half. And what we've seen and the theme it\u2019s really been or the underlying factors there have really been continued strength in our long-cycle businesses. So that's again really reflective of those favorable macros and the business positioning that we've done and the investments that we've done, in terms of globalization that we've made. The second thing is that we saw sequential improvement one quarter to second quarter in our short-cycle businesses in nearly every one of our businesses. And we also saw some notable pickup, it's not a trend, but we saw notable pickup in June. And we've seen, and in discussions with our business leaders, they're seeing clear evidence of anywhere -- you could call either stabilization or improvement in terms of what they're seeing in terms of their markets. So we think that we've got it prudently planned for the second half. But to Dave's point, if really viewed more over time, and from a macro standpoint, this is going to be -- continue to be a huge opportunity for Honeywell and becoming the Chinese competitor, executing like we are with our technologies to deal with the macro trends, there are favorable macro trends that'll continue to play out there. I think that's the way you want to look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about cash reinvestment here? I think there's been any comments made about M&A, pipeline or buybacks, what you're doing here?","David M. Cote","Well, the story really hasn't changed for us, Scott. Same sort of thing, we're going to make sure that we pay a very competitive dividend, recognizing the significance of that to our investors and we're a good cash generator. On the M&A side, same thing. What we always keep a very full pipeline of opportunity, more than we have money for. So we can be very selective about what it is we want to get, because as you know, price makes the difference. The -- you don't have a strategy regardless of price that price makes the difference. So we're going to continue to stay very disciplined in anything we do there. And when it comes to buybacks, same thing. We'll continue to be opportunistic with what we think makes sense.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Let's move on to PMT, and you've had a few great years there and obviously, Andreas has done a great job. But at what point do you kind of struggle to continue to grow without making some of these bigger investments, like a new Caprolactam plant or Fluorines or putting the multi-hundred million dollar investments in?","David M. Cote","Well, actually we're going to be running into some of that over the next 2 or 3 years. And I view this more as opportunity than a problem because the -- what we've been able to do in that business to really build on what was a good portfolio, just unrealized, continues to -- just our possibilities there continue to grow, that's not going to change. However, none of those investments of the sort of thing that are -- break the bank when it comes to how do we think about our cash flow, our cash deployment. I mean, none of this stuff is untoward or creates any kind of cash prices for us.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I think I get it. Aerospace, I mean, can you give us a ramp either one of the days on -- or give us an idea, at least, of how our D&A ramps the next couple of quarters and then into 2013? Just give a sense of where that spend goes.","David M. Cote","Our D&A?","David James Anderson","Well, the R&D spend. And what we've guided previously, obviously is higher R&D spend, Scott. This year, as we mentioned, when you look at the second quarter results for Aerospace, it really was favorability in terms of volume favorability, as well as strength in productivity really, offset by -- partially offset by higher R&D.","Elena Doom","Yes. We had about $20 million, Scott, in the quarter of higher R&D spend. And that's a level -- starting to level off given what we've seen in previous quarters.","David James Anderson","Right.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that comes down in 2013, is that correct?","David James Anderson","I think the absolute level is going to stay high. And I think the rate of the increase is going to continue to moderate. Because we saw the big increase, as you know, 2011 compared to 2010, further growth in 2012 compared to '11. And we'll see some moderation of that growth in 2013. But against the backdrop of a very robust pipeline of wins and successes that we've had, it's an opportunity-rich environment in Aerospace. And we just continue to face significant opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Question, I guess, following up on Scott's question regarding in the Aerospace margins. You mentioned that you're going to have a much more tempered aftermarket growth. Should we expect to see -- be able to hold these levels in terms of the margin performance in the back half of the year? Just comments or a little more color on the mix there.","David M. Cote","Well, we expect Aerospace to continue improving margins just like all the businesses. I don't expect to see a degradation.","David James Anderson","Yes, and I think the guidance, just to add to that, Elena, the guidance that we've given for Aerospace in terms of full year margins remains, absolutely.","Elena Doom","And actually, I think we have some upside relative to our full year guided range for Aerospace margin.","David James Anderson","Very, very good point. Yes, it's a very good point. When you look at -- Peter, at the guidance that we've provided in terms of stronger margin expansion for Honeywell for this year in terms of the guidance that we just went through for 2012, really a lot of that strengthening is attributable net of some other adjustments is attributable to Aerospace.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Defense and Space, your orders coming in modestly better than expectations, and you said the back half of the year looks like mid-single-digit decline versus what I think you previously expected. What -- can you give us a little more color what you're seeing there? Was it just one particular program or...","David James Anderson","It's really a number of things. The way Mike Madsen I think would describe it is a series of singles and doubles. That -- he's just really executing very, very smartly against a set of opportunities, frankly, that really are available to us both again domestically and internationally. There's a lot in the aftermarket. There's a lot in key offshore markets, Peter. And that's really what we're doing. There's nothing we would point to in terms of any major program win or...","Elena Doom","Nothing that\u2019s a big needle-mover.","David James Anderson","Exactly.","Elena Doom","I mean they\u2019re dogs and cats, but...","David James Anderson","Yes, a number of items.","David M. Cote","A lot of it -- to summarize Dave's point, it's just better execution in an area that we didn't really focus on as much as we could have in the past.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just related to that, is there expectation that you're going to see another long continuing resolution starting in October? And there's obviously the looming threat of sequestration. I don't think anyone really ultimately believes that will happen, but what is your -- have you done any advanced planning in preparation for that?","David M. Cote","Sure. Cause you just can't know. They're -- after what we saw happen with the debt ceiling, you can't assume that reason is going to prevail, so it's important to be able to plan accordingly. The good thing about our situation is it's not really -- none of our businesses are solely focused on Defense generally. It's same products, same services just going into the different sales channel, which gives us a lot more flexibility than others might have. So yes, we're fully prepared in the event that happens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question, just on the pension contribution impact from the Orissa and highway funding bill. Can you maybe talk through a little bit of what how in any way does this change what you're planning?","David M. Cote","Well, it doesn't really affect our planning, it affects our obligation. So what it does is it reduces the required Orissa-based funding over the next 3 to 5 years. But in terms of what we're planning, we're going to continue to be prudent here, to be out in front of this in a low-interest-rate environment. We think it's smart to be able to do it on that basis. So it's certainly -- it's a favorable event, but we don't see it as changing our basic plan of being prudent and being smart and basically measuring this a quarter at a time.","David M. Cote","We\u2019re just doing what's required and what's smart here. We've tried to always stay on the side of what's smart and we'll stay there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. And second question, around the currency, the FX impact, I know you've -- clearly, we see the translation side of this, a bit on the transaction side. Maybe talk about at what point, how strong does the dollar have to get before you start to think about a real legitimate competitive impact of this? Or it's just too far away to even bother with?","David M. Cote","I don't think it -- you can't -- you got to think about it, but I don't see something here, if you went to $1.10 or something like it used to, I don't see that having a big impact on us competitively around the world because we're everywhere as it is. So it's not something I worry about, let's put it that way.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. Even at $1.10?","David M. Cote","No.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then maybe just a question to follow up on that -- on the contingency actions on the ESS range. Contingency actions, how quick can you -- if things start to materialize through the quarter and you talked about implementing these things within the second half, is it really a fourth quarter set of outcomes here or you think you'd actually get third quarter runway on actions?","David James Anderson","Well, I think what Dave maybe answer it this way is what Dave has asked each of the business leaders to have, and this is nothing new, is to have in their top right hand desk drawer, this test that they would take in the event of, and fill in the blank in terms of volume decline or assumption change. That's just smart, and we think executed very well and came out stronger as a result of the '08, '09 downturn. And we've put that and enhanced -- put that into our playbook and enhanced our capability and our leadership plan as a result. So I think the fact is we've got the response to be able to do that.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, the ESS range seems relatively tight versus everything else. And you mentioned that its comp-based at the low end. Anything else that gives you comfort about on a relative basis sort of just sticking to that 2% to 4% range for Page 13?","David M. Cote","Yes. No, I get the point. Yes, I'd say that there's a range of possibilities there, and the 4% is likely as the 2% depending upon how the second half evolves. So it's tough to know. I would say one of the things that we do have, as you know, is last year was a very warm winter. And as result of that, the comp is lower in some of our key product lines. So if it doesn't develop that way this year, that'll make a difference.","Operator","Our final question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave, you've been pretty vocal on the fiscal cliff, you added your bet last week in EFT, you were on CNBC out there talking about these issues. Are you seeing anything in your short-cycle businesses in the U.S. that's prompting you to become incrementally more bearish on the impact of the impasse?","David M. Cote","I would say it's tough to know how things are going to evolve in a political environment. But this is -- as you know, I've been very vocal about CEOs need to speak up here because just seeing how the debt ceiling discussion evolved a few months ago, none of us in the business community ever expected that they could be that reckless overall. And as we look at the fiscal cliff, that's an even bigger looming issue. And it's important for all of us to be speaking up now to make sure that politicians get it, that this is not just a political advantage issue they're dealing with, but they're dealing with lives of a lot of people as they kind of to and fro on this stuff. So I think that's one of the things that's contributing to uncertainty amongst all companies when it comes to do you want to hire, do you want to invest. So I think there's a greater chance of an overall slowdown if we don't start to see some thoughtful movement and discussion about what they're actually going to do. So I would say it's less of a specific Honeywell item than it is an overall tone that starts to evolve in the economy if everybody starts thinking they could be reckless again.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. No, that's clear. And then if I just look at your second half buildup by business, I think it's on Slide 10, and you've been pretty -- Slide 12, and you've been, I think, more cautious on -- sorry, Slide 13. You've been more cautious on European LV production than consensus. But you're looking for second half to be flat to down 5%, which I think is a bit more positive than consensus. I'm just wondering, what's driving that more optimistic view?","David M. Cote","Well, consensus historically hasn't been all that accurate, as you know. It seems like if global GDP is growing 3% to 4% a year pretty consistently, the forecast are pretty good. When you run into something where it varies one way or the other, they're not very good at handling the, let's say, the variability of something like that. So we find that, second-guessing where it's going to go, is actually been more productive than relying on those consensus forecasts. And it's why in the first half, we've prepared for something that was worse than what everybody was saying, and I think we were right. And in the second half, we think it's reasonable -- one of the reasonable outcomes here is that it could be flat. But we're going to continue to plan for -- think of this as a decline.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that's consistent with the original plan. And then just finally, you called out ammonium sulfates and Caprolactam as driving the strength in PMT. Now those are your 2 most levered businesses to the U.S. nat gas price. And I'm wondering how much of a benefit was the low input cost in being compared against some of your global competitors in those businesses.","David M. Cote","It's not that big a deal. We already have, as you know, an extremely good cost position in that business. It does get enhanced at some with natural gas pricing being low. But it's going to be -- our cost position globally is the best in the world, and that's not going to change.","David James Anderson","It's really, it's really -- Nigel, it's really a function now of the global economy and the demand drivers there. I mean, obviously, on ammonium sulfate, the overall continued growth in terms of agricultural demand, the team there has just done an outstanding job of developing new customers, new markets. So we'll just continue to do that. But as long as those macro factors stay positive, we're, as Dave said, very, very well positioned.","Elena Doom","All right. Thank you again for your participation in today's call, and I'd like to just turn it over to Dave Cote for his closing remarks.","David M. Cote","Well, as you might expect, we're very happy with how we've performed in this difficult environment. And we expect that difficult environment to continue and think that's the right way to plan. But you can also expect that we'll continue to outperform, and the root cause is the same it's always been. A planning for a difficult environment is, of course, an important element, but just as important is all the seed planting we've done over the years in new products and services, new geographies and process initiatives. And we're going to stick with that game plan. We'll continue to plan conservatively and we'll continue to invest in the seed planting that positions us to perform well in good times and the tough times. So we're pleased of what we've been able to accomplish, and we look forward to a lot more in the future. And for Honeywell, the best is still yet to come. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"10637":["Honeywell International, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. ","Mark Macaluso","Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.Honeywell.com\/investor. ","Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. ","We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on our form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter and share with you our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. And as always, we will leave time for your questions at the end. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. ","Dave Cote","Good morning, everyone. As we previewed during our update call two weeks ago for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or $1.67, excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter which yields our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7. Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas that positioned the Company for better performance next year. These include the split of the former automation and controls solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of resins and chemicals.","Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone. In the fourth quarter we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect a continued ramp of our Solstice low global warming product sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues, our long cycle businesses are improving and our inflections start to kick in. ","It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continued to invest heavily in the business, in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile our continued emphasis on the Honeywell operating system and our performance culture, we're well-positioned for long term growth and are committed to creating long term shareowner value.","On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future, the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication I take full responsibility. Last week we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future.","We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting if you will and the returns will be there. We've outperformed historically and will continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be. ","So with that, I will turn it over to Tom. ","Tom Szlosek","Good morning. I'm now on slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by process solutions, transportation systems and home and building technologies, but was more than offset by softness in business jets, defense and space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.","The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflects the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about two years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income.","We continued to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners, our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter. Let me move on to slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our business jet OEM revenues and in defense and space, but also to a larger degree the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later, but in the third quarter year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top-line growth for aerospace. Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the business jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport.","Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket and we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result. Defense and space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we're encouraged by the double-digit increase in defense and space year-to-date orders and backlog, although as you can appreciate much of this activity is longer term in nature extending into 2017 and beyond. ","Transportation system sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. In home and building technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas environmental and energy solutions business. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions.","The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter. In performance materials and technology, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in process solutions which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end. Demand for our catalyst continues to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds.","Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low global warming materials within fluorine products continues to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within resins and chemicals. These resins and chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin. EMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6% driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally in safety and productivity solutions sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products.","The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison in the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes. Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single-digits on a core organic basis driving significant sequential quarter-to quarter EPS improvement.","Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally in process solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market, but all in all our outlook has improved. We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from safety and productivity solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in we have a funded pool of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.","All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of resins and chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal one-time M&A cost from Intelligrated and an expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. That's a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015. ","Let's turn to slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business jets and defense and space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in air transport and regional more than offset by declines in business and general aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization, while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new jet wave installations and channel and customer demand. The backlog in defense and space, as I said, is improving as we head into fourth quarter, but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single digit range on lower volumes globally.","And finally, transportation systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration offset by slower diesel penetration which would drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter. In HBT we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the UK and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in environmental and energy solutions business will continue to improve driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment which consists of the global distribution business and building solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business and in EMEA and China.","Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter of 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition. In PMT we see a return to growth in UOP driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business.","We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past three months were over $700 million and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally activity is picking up across the globe including in China and some projects that had been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter and our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In process solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single digit range on lower megaproject sales growth. However, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter.","Finally, in advanced materials core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice which will grow considerably this quarter and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, volume growth in fluorine products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix. In safety and productivity solutions we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment and as a result we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially.","This is also supported by a slightly easier setup in industrial safety driven by prior-year oil- and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated which we continue to be very excited about. We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.","Let's turn to slide 7 to discuss our expected full-year segment margin. On a reported basis we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement we expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continued to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell operating system and our restructuring capacity, we continued to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.","Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we're completing the first year of our nine recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50-basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60-basis points headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth, but given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat. ","Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn to a similar size benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017, as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell operating system continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around. ","Now on slide 8, we're reaffirming our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates. The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with a preview from October 7. With a lower than anticipated net income, principally in aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year. ","Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First in homes and buildings we'll continue to see steady growth driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our install base.","Next the dynamics we describe for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp ups including on the A350 platform and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind. We expect the declines in defense and space will moderate a bit in 2017, but we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, will no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HCSI and in addition our long cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier.","More than three quarters of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter. To moderate the effects of the overall declines in aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including sales head count, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market.","We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year. The vehicles market will continue to be strong, with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicle side in 2017 and on a global basis we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%. ","Lastly, advanced materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about a $1 billion business for us by 2020. Let me turn to slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning and as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow-growth environment, but also believe that the inflections we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve. ","With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning framework, specifically relative to business jets, defense and space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery and need specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth. Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in 2017. Let's spend a few minutes explaining the rationale underlying our outlook. ","Let me move to slide 11. First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in the each of the last two years and including the $0.5 billion that value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. ","On share repurchase we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat and we've been doing twice that amount. M&A activity has significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. ","For the past few quarters we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals and as that begins to roll off the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leverages Honeywell's channels and high growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. ","Slide 12 recaps the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast growing market where they are perceived as leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong new talent through our acquisitions that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives. ","Let me turn to slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jets and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. ","They're negotiated years in advance and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017 as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling. ","You can see on slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6 times depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments like Solstice are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. ","And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle after which we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize to between 1.0 and 1.2 times depreciation. We also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. ","Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily in our sales force. You may think of this as a short term investment, but it's not. ","A salesperson really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high growth regions, where our head count has grown nearly 14% in the last three years and we appointed more than $260 million to restructuring so far this year. ","Slide 15 has more detail about capital investments in performance materials and technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses like Solstice within flooring products and catalyst within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range and we expect more than $1 billion in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. ","After that and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which was just agreed to this week. In UOP we continued to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments. ","On slide 16 we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operation staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, SatCom1 and Com Dev and those investments are beginning to pay off. ","With Com Dev's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and SatCom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. ","Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to service airlines. We have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20 times less per megawatt than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipated the connected aircraft business would be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020. ","Let's turn to slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry; turbo chargers. As you've heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos, turbo charger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply auto makers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance they look to our technology which provides 30% more torque, 25% percent greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. ","Today more than one-third of all vehicles have a turbo charger and by 2020 we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year when we look at our data, our long term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM platform competitions globally. ","Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software-related. ","While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue. That number is expected to grow significantly over the next five years. The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. ","Last year Honeywell became the first and only large western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration, that's CMMI level 5, across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell. ","Let me turn to slide 19 and talk about high growth regions which represent about 40% of the world GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we're there and we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to insure that we'd get on our fair share of growth. ","Since 2003 we've increased our census in high growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive, 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high growth regions has grown at 12% CAGR. ","Today HGRs represent about one quarter of our overall sales growth and we expect that number will continue to grow. Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Light hours are growing and passengers are demanding an on the ground experience when it comes to connectivity. ","Our aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry leading technology that is being adopted by auto makers around the world. ","When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high growth regions we're addressing demand in the world's fastest growing economies through innovative local products and solutions. ","In PMT we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery, but we're seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in recounts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalyst reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. ","We've also invested in capacity for Solstice which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low global warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. ","The future is bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth. ","With that, I'll turn it back over it Dave. ","Dave Cote","So to summarize, we've made the right investments. We've taken the right portfolio actions and we have industry-leading products and services in the right markets. The future will be quite good for us. ","We continue to invest heavily to drive positions on winning platforms in aerospace and research and development to bring new breakthrough products and technologies to market, in salespeople and repositioning and in capacity expansions and highly profitable businesses, including UOP and fluorine products. We'll see the benefits of this next year, 2018 and many years to come. You'll hear Darius and Tom talk a lot more about this in the outlook call that we'll have in mid-December. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. ","Scott Davis","You've had a few weeks now, we've had three weeks in October and UOP is a pretty lumpy business. I mean your confidence seems to be really high that comes back in 4Q. Is that based on what you've actually started to see in October or just a function of the backlogs there so it should start to get released? ","Dave Cote","This is mostly orders that are already there and that the guys have actually been doing a fair amount of the production already to be able to ship into the fourth quarter. So we have a high level of confidence on UOP. Tom, anything you want to add? ","Tom Szlosek","No, the visibility to the install base is pretty good. Much of the business is reload activity and we're tied at the hip with the customers. ","Scott Davis","Yes, no I get it. Let me ask it a different way. I've covered you long enough to know that this stuff gets -- something pushed from December 20 to January 3rd, it wouldn't surprise me in UOP because that's just the nature of the business. So I know you've got the orders, but your confidence in actually seeing it in 4Q versus 1Q 2017 based on what you've seen in October. Has that changed? That's what I'm trying to ask. I didn't ask it very well. ","Dave Cote","No. ","Scott Davis","No meaning, confidence is better or-- ","Dave Cote","No, no, no. We're in the same place we were. We feel good about it. I suppose there's always that chance that it can happen, but the lumpiness is not so much moving from that we missed a shipment as it is that when the shipments are going to occur. They're already planned. They've already got the orders. They're already producing. We don't see any issues there. ","Scott Davis","Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around that. It's tough for us to model it. My only other question is the PMT capacity investments you've made, when you roll that stuff out and you start producing in 2017, do you make a margin on that right away or do you have to hit a certain level of capacity utilization before you really start to make a margin in that? ","Dave Cote","There's typical startup costs, but it's a disciplined startup process. I mean, of course in the first few months you're not running at full optimization, but it isn't very long after that you do achieve the impacts of the volume that are coming through. ","Scott Davis","Okay. So you're not losing money out of the gate, per se. You can actually start making money day one, but obviously that margin ramps up when your utilization goes higher. ","Dave Cote","That's the expectation, yep. ","Tom Szlosek","That's true. Yes, it's not a drag from the beginning. ","Scott Davis","Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around it. Thank you, I do appreciate it. ","Dave Cote","Thanks Scott. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. ","Steve Tusa","Funny we're talking about slippage on this call. You have done a pretty good job over time of calling annual guidance over the last ten years, so just an interesting question. But when it comes to aerospace, you're exiting the year at a pretty negative trend line on organic. I mean, just to think about the comps next year that gives you confidence that you can hold aero close to the flat line organic. I'm just kind of thinking about the direction of that business definitely suggests that it should be down next year organically, just kind of the early read on that. ","Dave Cote","Well, let me put this into context of total 2017, because I'm assuming that question will come up also. We're going to plan sales conservatively based on what we're seeing this quarter and that will include aero being on the more negative side when we think about business jets and commercial helicopters. ","So we want to make sure that we're consistent with what we're seeing and that we're not Pollyannaish in any way with our sales planning. HTSI and RNC will also be coming -- the government services business and the resins and chemicals business will also be coming out, so we'll have had like three quarters of both businesses being in in 2016, they'll be out in 2017. ","We also have a number of pluses, so we'll have the impact of restructuring, the aero incentives begins to decline. We've got the impact of all the acquisitions that we did and you understand the first year hit we normally take from there. Interest expense should be a positive. UOP, SPS, Solstice, those should all be positives. ","And we're going to put all this together and have a much more in-depth discussion in December after we've had a chance to go through all the AOP planning and Darius and Tom are going to take the lead on that. And that's why we feel comfortable in saying that even in this slower macro and we think more difficult aero side on biz jets and commercial helos in particular, that we feel comfortable with the statements that we've made about 2017. Hopefully that helps. ","Steve Tusa","No, that helps a lot and that's still embedded in the -- and thanks for the follow up by the way, allowing me to ask a follow up. And you think that's embedded in the low single-digit guidance that you're giving? You can still grow the Company with aero down? ","Dave Cote","Yes. ","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last question for you. When it comes to buyback and capital allocation decisions, who's steering the ship right now? I mean is that collaborative with Darius? Is that, who's making the call on perhaps doing the bigger buyback? The stock obviously took a hit, your presentation on Mad Money suggested it was overdone, so who's making the call on the buyback at this stage? ","Dave Cote","Well, consistent with our policy over the last 15 years, I try to make all of these decisions with no input from anybody. No, of course it's collaborative. We make no decisions here without trying to get input from everybody and making sure that everybody weighs in. So yes, as you might imagine we have a lot of discussion about it and from time to time we let Darius out of that closet that I talked about in the last call so we get his input on things. ","It's obviously collaborative. Darius is involved. Tom is. We discuss it with the Board. It's not a surprise to anyone -- well, except maybe externally when we do announce it, because we want to be thoughtful in what we do. And the way we've always tried to run the Company, not just on buybacks but any decision, is that we want all the input, all the opinions conflicting, agreeing, whatever they are, so that at the end of the day, we make the best decisions. I've always felt like we get measured on the quality of our decisions, not on whether somebody was right or wrong from the beginning and that's how we handle the buyback decisions also. ","Tom Szlosek","I was just going to add one element to that, Steve. I mean we're obviously subject to the blackout periods in trading of our stock, so that comes into play from a timing perspective. But as we've referenced in the past, we do have some programmed 10B51 types of plans in place that do a modest amount of activity based on certain levels of trading in the stock. ","Steve Tusa","Yes, that's fine. You don't need to make it some big splashy headline. Thanks. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe","Good morning. I do want to echo the comments from Steve. It's amazing how quickly a decade of execution gets lost in noise and the transparency provided around this second half mess I think is well appreciated. So I just wanted to say that. ","So aerospace the near term outlook is pretty ugly. Biz jet we all know how bad that is right now. When do you see the crossover point between biz jet moderating, the decline moderating and then the ATROE starting to pick up? Is that a second half 2017 event or do you think it's earlier than that? ","Dave Cote","The ATR side has actually performed fine and we're going to continue to see things like A350 pick up, so that's going to be a benefit to us. The biz jet side and commercial helos should I would suspect are going to continue to be a market drag for us next year. When we put all that together, aerospace is still going to be an important performer for us overall. You saw a fair amount of the restructuring also occur there and we think it's going to be a good performer for us in the long term. But 2017 is still going to be little bit tougher overall, I think when you put all that together. ","Nigel Coe","Is it too early to have confidence in growth or is it too touch and go to make that call? ","Dave Cote","Are you talking about growth in the business overall? ","Nigel Coe","For 2017, yes. ","Dave Cote","For 2017 we want to go through the AOP planning to make sure that we understand all the pieces, but at this point I think we're probably going to plan this more conservatively than less. So I'd say overall probably lower sales next year than this year will be the way that we'll plan for it. We really haven't gone through all our planning process yet. ","Nigel Coe","And then as a follow on, the $1 billion forecast for Solstice in 2020 is obviously a big number. Can you just remind us where is the backlog right now for Solstice? What is the current revenue base and how do you think the Rwanda agreement, how do you think that expands the scope for Solstice? ","Tom Szlosek","Yes, in rough order of magnitude we're probably a $400 million or so business currently and that continues to grow nicely as we've said. I mean it's more right now mobile air conditioning which is a brand new segment for us, but as we continue to progress through it, we get into buildings and blowing agents and other things. ","So it becomes a broader application for us. As far as the new regulation, it remains to be seen how that agreement will impact us, but our forecasts are not dependent upon anything that happened this past week. We do see it as potential opportunity, but we need to sort through and fully understand those impacts close to 2020. ","Dave Cote","I would say though, Nigel, it's clearly a good development and world's focus on low global warming potential products makes a difference. If you take a look at the HFCs that our product replaces, HFCs are up over 1,300 times worse than a single-molecule CO2. If you take a look at HFOs, our invention, it's actually 0.8 molecules of CO2, so like 1,500 times better than what you would see from HFCs. So it's a significant new product.","There is a recognition that HFCs do have a big impact, negative impact on global warming potential and Solstice, our HFO is just a tremendous solution for it. And the faster it gets adapted, the more quickly governments will actually be working to stem the tide of global warming. So we think it's going to be quite important. ","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Andrew Obin","I missed the preview call because I assumed nothing bad was going to happen. So I was out of the office. So I'm going to have a follow up question to that. Just on these incremental aero incentives, my understanding is that these are in fact tied to faster shipments to customers than previously agreed. And if that's the case, what's the impact on revenue and profit for aero in 2017 from taking higher incentives in 2016? ","Tom Szlosek","So Andrew let me clarify that. The incentives become due and are recorded and recognized in our financials when the milestones that govern that incentive are reached. The milestones are generally development or performance-related milestones.","They vary by customer. So for example, if you hit the first test flight or entry into service or other types of engineering milestones, those could trigger an incentive being owed and due and it's recognized in our financials. When you look at 2016, our P&L has been significantly burdened by, to the tune of $0.25 as I said earlier of EPS, by incremental OEM incentives. ","Next year this is the peak year and it starts to tail off next year. We get a modest tailwind and then it really accelerates into 2018 and 2019 in terms of the tail wind, yes. ","Andrew Obin","No, I just want to understand accounting relationship. Do incentives, because my understanding is that incentives, higher incentives do rely on hitting milestones earlier as you said does translate ultimately into faster shipments to the customers. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Is there a connection? ","Tom Szlosek","It's not a direct connection because, I mean the incentives for us are largely based on the development process and bringing the aircraft to production. And so while you might incrementally get to faster production, you still have to have orders, you still have to have selling and those cycle times generally are unaffected by -- or incentives are generally unaffected by those activities. ","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question. ","Dave Cote","Andrew, I should add these are good investments for us to be making. We expense everything as incurred. We don't put it on the balance sheet, so we take our hits as they're occurring, unlike others who put it on the balance sheet and you see it over time. ","So for us while it's painful in the short term, it sure as heck helps where you're going in the long term. And these were decisions that we made several years ago to make sure that we were on the right platforms with the right kinds of products and services going forward. So this is pretty smart money. It's painful in the short term, but it's smart money and positions us extremely well for the future. ","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question on connection between global airline passenger traffic and your commercial aviation aftermarket. You were up one. My understanding is that global passenger traffic was up mid-single digits. Is there a reason for the disconnect? Is there destocking deferred maintenance or anything else driving the difference? Thank you. ","Dave Cote","Well, this is one that's always kind of interesting when you look at aftermarket versus flight hours, because while flight hours develop pretty consistently over time and they tend to go up 3% or 4% a year; even in a bad time, they'll go down for a single year and then pop back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth. ","The aftermarket stream associated with it, though, bounces around in sometimes crazy directions. If you recall the recession, for example, where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20% or 30% in that same year. ","So the long term trend is generally consistent with what those flight hours are. In the short term it can bounce around quite a bit, so being able to explain the difference between say 3% and 1% is easily within the realm of typical variability. ","Tom Szlosek","The other thing I'd add to that Andrew, is that you've got a combination of both air transport and business jets in that 1%. We talked a little bit about the slowdown on the business jet RNO activity. I was going through the slides and that has contributed to this. ","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. ","Steven Winoker","I just want to first follow up the earlier comments on UOP and fourth quarter confidence. The question specifically, if you look at the incremental, you've got this 20% growth and whatnot orders on the catalyst side, where are the incremental catalyst volumes going to? If you think about refining versus pet cam for that part of the growth, is there any impact at all from first wave Gulf Coast crackers that have been delayed? ","Dave Cote","Wow, that's a level of specificity, Steve, I'd have to say we'll have to get back to you on that one. ","Steven Winoker","Okay. Just so you know in advance, this is an investor discussion based on just concerns about that visibility even in those end markets for other companies, so that's where that comes from. That would be helpful. The second one, Dave, you'll love this, I think. Just hope you're sitting on this one. It's like a bad relationship where one bad thing happens and all of a sudden everything else comets comes out, right. So in a lot of investor discussions I've been certainly defending Honeywell's growth in aerospace and margins versus the margins in aerospace over time. ","The assertion is that Honeywell somehow has been trading off growth for margin expansion when you look at specific platform wins. And as you say in slide 13, large wins on the right platforms to accelerate growth. I'd like to give you an opportunity to maybe address that directly to a lot of investors out there who are concerned about this from a higher level perspective. ","Dave Cote","Yes, it's one I always kind of wonder so what date are they looking at when it comes to -- I assume this is the market share question, Steve? ","Steven Winoker","Mostly, yes. ","Dave Cote","Yes, because if you look at the dater, it actually looks very good for us. And to your point, we're selective on the platforms that we pick. I've always been shocked at the investor reception when one of our competitors says that they've won 32 of the last 25 competitions and when you say, geez, now they're winning over 100% of all the competitions out there, how is that possible? And I think they're getting a little carried away with what do they count and what do they not count. ","If you take a look at our avionics performance, it's quite good and there's future stuff that we'll end up talking about at some point. If you take a look at the concessions that we're paying right now, for example, that you would look at that and say, oh, that yielded a bunch of good platforms also. ","When you look at the amount of R&D that we spend in aerospace it's kind of -- I don't know what the heck they're pointing to when they say it. It's one thing to be able to say some of this stuff. It's a little different when you actually have to back it up. I just have a tough time seeing it. I don't know where they're getting it from. ","Steven Winoker","And then finally on the capital deployment front, you have repeated the kind of window or envelope that you have to work with over a few years of something in the order of $25 billion. There's always a big difference between what you could spend and what you will spend and when and how obviously. So as you look at the market now and you look at the discussions you're having with huge pipeline that Ann and company and everybody has developed, what's your level of optimism again and the kind of types of M&A activity that investors should be prepared for? ","Dave Cote","Well, it's always tough to predict, as we've said before and we're going to continue to do both the divestitures and acquisitions in a way that causes us to improve the overall growth profile of the company. The problem of course is you can't predict them. You can't say it's $2 billion a year, $5 billion a year. It's going to be 0 one year, 6 another. You just don't know. ","So we have to take our opportunities as they arise and we'll continue to do that. We do have a good balance sheet, like having that. We think that gives us the opportunity to be smart when it comes time to doing a deal or when it comes time to having the capability to repurchase and we'll continue to be opportunistic on both. ","Steven Winoker","And I guess maybe just one last follow up there. In terms of software solutions stuff versus consolidating products, is everything on the table or directing more one way? ","Dave Cote","Are you saying from an acquisition perspective, Steve? ","Steven Winoker","Yes.","Dave Cote","Yes, well the nice thing about having so many opportunities and so many places for us to go, all the stuff you talked about is interesting, whether it's technology, software, stuff that does a better job of connecting the digital physical world. So there are lot of places for us to run here. ","It's really a question of what's available and is the price right. We're still always going to be very conscience that price makes a difference. If you pay for a strategy because the strategy is right, what ends up happening is the seller is the one who made all the money on the strategy, not you. We're going to continue to be thoughtful about how do we do that. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. ","Howard Rubel","I'm not going to ask an aerospace question, I think I know that market pretty well. Instead I'd like to-- ","Dave Cote","Wow, I was prepared, Howard. I was prepared for that and for someday for them to actually pronounce your last name correctly. ","Howard Rubel","Well, you're taking the words out of my mouth, but I'm going to try on restructuring for a moment and because you talk about it as being a permanent change to the way in which you're going to be able to compete and run the business. Can you give us some of the nuts and bolts behind this? Because it's a very large number and probably is very meaningful to several of the businesses. ","Tom Szlosek","Yes, well, you can start Howard, with aerospace. You know that over the course of the year because of the volumes as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business and a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the desegregation of ACS we also went through a significant management spans and layers exercise, so what we try to do is limit and reduce the number of layers that we have from the top boss down to the lowest level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. ","That also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain we continue to have lots of opportunities, whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We've found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganization that we've done as well as continual addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. And then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, you do have to apply restructuring. ","Again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% percent of cost synergies on the acquisition. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements. But some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those are the three principal areas and as a result you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool of funded projects that we have, as I said. ","Howard Rubel","And then the follow-up questions on software, as you are able to transition away from selling a product but instead selling upgrades and I'll call it enhancements or increased applications, can you, Dave, provide us with some -- I mean to some degree that provides some substantial margin headwind or opportunity rather or tailwind rather, margin and tailwind going forward. Could you provide some context of how you've been able to see that and what I'd call give us some hard examples? Because it could be quite compelling. ","Dave Cote","I'm sorry, Howard, I'm not sure I followed that one. Hard examples of what exactly? ","Howard Rubel","For example, in avionics instead of having to sell a box you sell a software upgrade. So the software costs you a minimal amount of money and yet it enhances the value of the aircraft. ","Dave Cote","I understand and yes you're correct and of course we expense all our R&D as we go along. We don't put any of that on the balance sheet either. So we take the hits for the R&D which can be substantial if you're trying to develop software, but once you do and you start selling the software packages and the upgrades, so whether it's weather radar or a runway incursion or excursion, possibilities, the JetWave. As you start to get into that it is substantial. The margin rates are significantly better. ","Howard Rubel","That applies not just to aero though, it applies I would think to elements of home and building or process control and I was just hoping maybe you can provide us with a sense of where you are today and where you might be in three to five years in terms of just the intensity of the business change? ","Dave Cote","I wouldn't put any numbers on it at this point, but your concept is absolutely correct. That is definitely the -- let's say the direction of the Company and it's why we focused as much as we do on software and I think puts us in position for a very good future for the entire Company. We've got a bigger advantage here than anybody else with almost half of our engineers focused on software today. It puts us in a much better position. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Just want to get my head around restructuring for 2017, not benefits of what you've already accomplished, but new actions. I think on the slide if I interpret it correctly, you're saying the tax rate benefit from the share accounting change will be restructured away. I'm wondering if we should expect the same for any pension benefits that flow through on service costs and are those the two main toggles that would actually define what your restructuring would be next year or is there some other expected danger, other things? Anything you can frame there would be helpful. ","Dave Cote","Yes, the way I would think about it, Jeff, is you probably noticed that over a long period of time we do a lot of restructuring. If we've got some kind of unusual gain, we usually use it to restructure. We take a lot through operations generally every quarter. It's one of those things where we want to constantly be investing. We're not going to run out of ideas. I wouldn't want to go into too much detail until we've had a chance to go through all our AOP planning, but I would be surprised if next year we didn't also have additional restructuring ideas as we went along and that we'll find a way to fund them. ","Jeffrey Sprague","It's meaningfully not lower number than it was in 2016? ","Dave Cote","Well, in 2016 of course we had a big boost as we figured out how to do the additional restructuring in the third quarter. I wouldn't anticipate that we'd do something that big again next year, but you never know. I don't want to -- as you know, I never say never on any of this stuff, but the whole ideas of how do you just constantly have a good pipeline of ideas and find a way to fund the really good ones so that you do the seed planting for the future, that's something we're going to continue doing. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And just back to the OEM incentives maybe one more time, obviously the accounting is very conservative. Just wonder if you could give us a little thought though on the return metrics as you think about making the investments. Obviously the ultimate success or failure of the investment is going to depend on the commercial success of the airplane and units sold and all that, but what kind of return thresholds do you use when you think about these investments? And what kind of cushion versus weighted average cost of capital or whatever metric you use to kind of decide if you pull the trigger on this sort of stuff? ","Dave Cote","Yes, I guess there's a couple of things that we end up looking at. I won't put a specific number on the return because that's -- I just don't think that's a good thing to have public out there. But this has to be a high return project, the same sort of thing that we look at for any internal investment because that's what it is. And that's why we pay so much attention to what platform is it and what do we really think is going to happen. So we don't just take an external look or the customers look at what do they think it's going to be, but we really go through this ourselves to say what do we really think is possible here and how do we make sure that this is going to generate a good return for the Company. ","Our guys do a pretty good job of this so that we pick the right platforms. And when you see the concessions that we're paying, it's been so that we could do that. So these are going to be high return very good IRR projects and platforms that we're on. We're pretty confident of that based on what we've done and what we see. ","Tom Szlosek","Jeff, the way I think of it is we have a very disciplined process when it comes to considering whether we compete for a new platform that's a potential opportunity for us. It's as disciplined as an M&A process, so we consider all of the investments. These incentives are one aspect of that. I mean there's a lot of engineering time and project management time that also goes into the outflows or the investments that you're making. And then of course you consider all the future revenues and the models and so forth. It's as disciplined as M&A. And as Dave said, we have internal returns that we look to as the hurdles. We'll go ahead with the ones that do meet those attractive rates. ","Dave Cote","And for what it's worth, Jeff, we're very conscious of the time value of money. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. ","Joe Ritchie","So my first question is on slide 7, when you take a look at your margin bridge for next year and you see all the headwinds that are basically going away, it's about 150 basis points. You're doing a bunch of restructuring this year, you think growth is going to get better next year and yet where the planning for next year is 45 to 75 basis points it seems really conservative. What am I missing here? ","Dave Cote","I would say we've done our -- we think we've provided a lot of color commentary on 2017 at this point, more than we normally ever would. And I would just say stay tuned for the December outlook call. We'll go through a lot more detail then with Darius and Tom to be able to explain what will we see and why. ","And we're going to be very conscious of having gotten burned on the macro environment this year and as conservative as I thought we were being in the beginning we weren't conservative enough. So we're going to want to make sure that as we pull together a plan for 2017 that it's one that never ends up with the kind of snail surprise that we ended up taking this year. ","Joe Ritchie","That's fair, Dave and definitely good to be conservative into next year. Maybe my one follow up is really just on the M&A that you've done. Tom, I think you'd mentioned on the prior call that the growth was running at about high single digits and I think the accretion was kind of coming in towards the higher end of your range. I'm just wondering how much of the deal-related costs, the inventory step up, how much of those costs go away next year? And then where -- are we still running at the same kind of growth and EPS rates for this year? ","Tom Szlosek","Yes, well, first if you look at the -- I mean the deals that we've integrated this year, most of them were closed in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. And yes, you had a lot of startup costs in particularly the first three quarters of this year. Intelligrated which we closed in late August, will add to those one-time startups. ","But net\/net when you consider amortization and inventory accounting and the other things, the year-over-year impact will be favorable on those deals. But the more important thing is that the operations and the cost synergies that we get typically start to ramp in the second half of the first year into the second year. ","And that's where you start to see the margin rate improvement. So we'll go through the in details in December, but this should be a nice contributor to what we had for 2017. ","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. ","Christopher Glynn","I'll get my two up front. Dave, had a question on your sales employee census data up 10%, didn't look like it grew much in 2015 despite higher M&A. The increase looks like a big organic component. Just wondering where the raw head count is and where it's especially ROI sensitive. And then my second question would be probably a follow on to Joe's, if you'd quantify what the purchase accounting burden is in 2016 in terms of EPS? ","Dave Cote","Yes, on the first one on salespeople, a lot of those have been deployed to what we refer to as high growth regions. And the reason for highlighting it, of course, is that when you hire salespeople there's training and familiarization that has to go on. So they're not immediately productive. It's the sort of thing that shows up in the future. I won't -- difficult to quantify at this point what that's worth to us say next year and the year after. But it's another investment that -- where we take the expense up front, because of course you've got to pay them while the sales numbers they deliver aren't quite enough to pay for themselves in those first years. ","So this is a good thing for us to be doing, a good way for us to expand our high growth region presence, but it's the sort of thing that's another investment for the future for us. On the restructuring side, I don't -- I know we've shared some data, not restructuring, the -- ","Christopher Glynn","Purchase accounting. ","Dave Cote","Purchase accounting, yes. Tom, I don't know that I want to go too much more than what we've already disclosed here. ","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I think we keep it at an overall contribution, for 2016 M&A is -- we guided at $0.05 to $0.15 of overall contribution to EPS. And that is an all in number that takes into account all of those one-time costs as well as the pure operations. In 2017 you can expect that to be a bigger number as a result of a lot of those costs going away. You can kind of calibrate it when we provide that in December. ","Operator","That concludes today's question-and answer-session. Mr. Cote, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. ","Dave Cote","Yes, thank you. On October 7 we went out of our way to be transparent. With our focus on transparency, I lost sight of how important it was to also convey our confidence in the future. Hopefully our confidence in that future came across today. We look forward to sharing more with you in our December outlook call. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"10930":["Honeywell International, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Bendza, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Bendza","Thank you, Abby. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings and 2020 outlook conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today.

As always, we\u2019ll leave time for your questions at the end.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. We are very pleased with our results in 2019. We\u2019ve finished a great year of another strong quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $2.06 adjusted earnings per share above the high end of the guidance range, 130 basis points of margin expansion and maybe most importantly $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow resulting in the fourth quarter conversion of 154%. With this conclusion to the year, we met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics in 2019, managing through a volatile environment and delivering adjusted earnings per share of $8.16, $0.06 above the high end of our initial 2019 guidance.","Despite the challenging broad macro environment in 2019, we grew organic sales 5%, driven by strength across \u2013 on much of our portfolio throughout the year. Growth was driven by Commercial Aerospace, Defense, Process Solutions and Building Products. We also had strong orders for HPS mega projects, UOP equipment and Defense and overall a 100% in calibrator orders during the fourth quarter. These robust orders contribute to a 10% year-over-year increase in long cycle backlog. Additionally, in 2019, Honeywell Connected Enterprise drove double-digit software growth.","We expanded segment margin 150 basis points or 70 basis points, excluding the impact of the 2018 spinoff, both 10 basis points above the high end of our 2019 guidance. Our growth combined with productivity rigor and commercial excellence, drove margin expansion in Aerospace, Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies. We generated $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, exceeding the high end of our initial guidance by approximately $300 million and resulting in 105% free cash flow conversion or 114% free cash flow conversion, excluding pension income.","We continue to make smart investments in our businesses, people and communities. We deployed $7.8 billion of capital in 2019 across share repurchases, higher dividends, high return CapEx and two acquisitions including the Rebellion Photonics, a provider of innovative, intelligent visual gas monitoring solutions, which we closed in the fourth quarter. This also include over 10 investment by Honeywell Ventures for over $50 million deployed in 2019 bringing our total venture investments to-date to over $75 million.","We continued to have our robot pipeline of M&A opportunities with significant balance sheet capacity deployed. We launched a new brand campaign to highlight some of the most exciting innovations and we\u2019re ranked number 13 on the Forbes Magazine list of the World\u2019s Most Reputable Companies for Corporate Responsibility. Lastly, we continue to make progress in our breakthrough and transformation initiatives, which I\u2019ll cover next in more detail.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. We continue to make significant progress on three key initiatives in support of our transformation to a software industrial company. In 2019, we\u2019ve commercialized Honeywell Forge enterprise performance management software, which helps companies in a variety of industries gather, gain insights from and ultimately autonomously control their operations, drive efficiency and safety. Honeywell Forge helped drive double-digit connected software growth this year. Additionally, HCE is leading their transition to more recurring revenue models across the company, has delivered key wins and stronger customer relationships throughout 2019 and will continue to drive growth across Honeywell, including a 20% connected software growth compounded annual growth rate over five years.","We also made great strides in our Integrated Supply Chain transformation. We established supply based management strategy for 11 categories across the enterprise, enabled our businesses to take actions to substantially reduce their distribution manufacturing footprint, drove improvements in sourcing productivity, and in the fourth quarter we began seeing broad improvements in our inventory. We are on track to achieve our long-term targets, including $0.5 billion of run rate benefits, and a $1 billion reduction in inventory.","On Honeywell Digital, which is foundational to running Honeywell; with data driven decision making, we\u2019ve matured our data management practices, digitized key processes through the deployment of new technology platforms, rationalized over 500 software applications, cleansed 5.2 million critical master data records, eliminated 20 ERP systems and reduced websites by 58%. When complete, we expect our digital transformation to deliver $0.5 billion of run rate benefits across sales, productivity and working capital improvements.","We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made with each of our transformation initiatives in 2019 and we\u2019ll continue to build on this momentum in 2020 as we transform into a software industrial. In summary, we had a terrific 2019, both in our short-term operating performance and longer term transformation agenda, and we\u2019re setting ourselves up for a strong 2020 and beyond.","Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our fourth quarter results and provide our 2020 outlook.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Darius, and good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter, we grew organic sales by 2%, driven by 7% organic growth in Aerospace, as well as continued growth in our Process Automation, UOP and Building Management Products businesses. SPS contracted during the quarter, but the turnaround of productivity progress \u2013 product is progressing. Intelligrated sales improved sequentially, but they were down year-over-year as expected due to tough comps, compared to nearly 50% growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Importantly, orders were up 100% as the major project orders we anticipated in Intelligrated materialized to set us up well for 2020.","Our organic growth combined with commercial and operational excellence and the benefits from the portfolio enhancements that we made in 2018 drove segment margin expansion of 130 basis points, with segment margin again exceeding 21% this quarter. Excluding the favorable impact of the spinoffs, segment margins expanded by 90 basis points, which was 40 basis points above the high end of our guidance, driven by our strong commercial excellence and productivity programs.","We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.6, up 11%, excluding the impact of the spinoff and above the high end of our guidance. In addition to strong segment profit performance, earnings per share benefited from lower share count due to our buyback program, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, which more than offset our planned lower pension income.","During the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with conversion of 154% on the strength of improvements in working capital, primarily from cash collections and inventory reductions. As Darius highlighted, we\u2019re beginning to see the effects of our supply chain transformation as demonstrated by inventory improvements in the fourth quarter. This resulted in full year adjusted free cash flow of $6.3 billion and conversion of 105% above the high end of our guidance range.","We continue to execute our capital deployment strategy in the fourth quarter. We deployed $644 million to dividends and $750 million to repurchases of Honeywell shares, bringing the total share repurchase for the year to $4.4 billion, resulting in a 3% share reduction, which is above the commitment of at least 1% share count reduction that we highlighted at the beginning of the year. We also completed the acquisition of Rebellion Photonics and funded two additional Honeywell Venture investments.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and talk about the segments. Starting with Aerospace, sales up 7% on an organic basis and orders were up double digits, finishing an outstanding year for the business overall. Defense & Space grew 9%, led by increased aftermarket volumes on key U.S. DoD programs and global demand for guidance and navigation systems. Backlog for Defense & Space is up double digits. Additionally, demand for Honeywell Forge drove double-digit JetWave growth in defense. As you recall, we launched JetWave for military platforms in 2018 and we continue to be excited about the connected growth opportunities there.","In Commercial OE, sales were up 4% organically, driven by increased deliveries across major OE business aviation platforms, partially offset by lower air transport sales. Commercial aftermarket grew 6% organically driven by strong demand in air transport while business jet aftermarket sales were approximately flat.","Aerospace segment margin expanded 270 basis points driven by productivity, commercial excellence and strong aftermarket volumes. 2019 was another outstanding year for the Aerospace team. In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 11% on an organic basis, driven by lower sales volumes and productivity products, the impact of major systems project timing in Intelligrated, and lower demand for personal protective equipment.","SPS segment margins contracted 330 basis points year-over-year to approximately 13%, similar to prior quarters as a result of the volume deleveraging productivity products and personal protective equipment. Within our Intelligrated warehouse automation business as we expected, sales were down double-digits due to difficult comps and the timing of several major systems projects. 4Q and 1Q are the two most difficult quarters that Intelligrated will face as sales were up nearly 50% in each of those comparable periods.","As we discussed in our last call, the order\u2019s pipeline has been robust for the second consecutive quarter, Intelligrated posted significant growth with orders up over 100%, which contributed to more than 30% increase in the backlog year-over-year. This positions the business well for 2020 as these major projects begin to drive growth starting in the second quarter and beyond. Importantly, Intelligrated\u2019s aftermarket service businesses continue to benefit from our large and growing installed base with strong double-digit sales growth for life cycle support and services.","In productivity products, we continue to see distributor destocking, but inventories are now approaching normalized levels and we expect the business to return to growth in 2020. We have taken significant actions to address the challenges in this business as we have discussed previously and we\u2019re seeing improvements in our commercial operations as a result, which is reflected in the sequential sales growth compared to the third quarter of 2019. We\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see further improvements in the business throughout 2020. In the Safety business, organic sales for the quarter were down 5% as continued demand for our gas sensing products, was more than offset by decreased volumes of personal protective equipment and softer demand in the retail business.","Moving to Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were up 3% organically, primarily driven by ongoing strength and commercial fire products in the U.S. Double-digit growth across our suite of building management products including double-digit growth in our connected software platforms and growth in security. That was partially offset by Building Solutions sales, which were down for the quarter as the client is in projects including the energy savings performance contracts business offset double-digit growth in the airport vertical.","HBT segment margins expanded 170 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by the favorable impact from the spin-offs of the homes business. Segment margins excluding the impact from spin accretion were approximately flat in the quarter as we \u2013 and we expect this to improve in 2020 as we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin targets for the business.","Finally, in Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3% on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were up 6% organically, driven by strength across the automation portfolio and smart energy. Additionally, orders in the automation and projects businesses were up double digits allowing us to exit the year with a strong backlog notably in our global mega projects business, which was up double digits.","In UOP, sales were up 3% organically, in petrochemical catalysts and our equipment business, partially offset by declines in gas processing due to fewer domestic cryo unit sales, as a result of the continuation of software midstream gas processing markets in the U.S. Backlog was up high single digits in UOP driven by strong double-digit growth in equipments, which carries lower margins as you know.","Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 4%, driven by lower volumes in pricing and flooring products due to the ongoing impact of the illegal HFC imports into Europe. Recent estimates suggest that these illegal imports are contributing annual emissions at least equivalent to that of 3.5 million cars. This means we take a forest the size of Portugal to capture all the illegal emissions.","We continue to actively work in partnership with private industry, EU regulators, and EU member countries to address harmful illegal HFC imports. Increasing seizures of illegally important HFCs are encouraging, but they\u2019re not yet meaningful enough reductions to the total illegal imports. While these efforts are ongoing, we\u2019ll continue to experience pressure on HFC pricing and volumes for the remainder of Advanced Materials, electronic materials grew mid single-digits and packaging and composites was up high single-digits. This was partially offset by softer demand in additives and chemicals.","So overall, PMT segment margins contracted by 80 basis points in the quarter driven by direct materials volumes, the mix of catalyst shipments and higher mix of UOP equipment partially offset by improvements in productivity. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the mix of catalyst sales and equipment project timing in UOP has an outsized impact on margins quarter-to-quarter and for the full-year, PMT margins expanded 70 basis points. So overall, we capped off the year with a very strong fourth quarter performance and earnings, margin expansion and cash as well as strong orders resulting in a healthy backlog as we enter into 2020.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and discuss the markets and our 2020 outlook. As Darius mentioned in 2019, we managed through a challenging year, where trade tensions and reality of tariffs were constant. The uncertainty of Brexit interest rate policy and indications of a possible recession with signals like the inverted yield curve, weighed on markets.","Today, some of those issues have started to resolve themselves with the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal now in place and a more clear path forward on Brexit, but many uncertainties remain as we begin 2020. There\u2019s much more work to be done on the comprehensive long-term agreement between China and the U.S. Brexit has a conclusion; however, the execution of their exit from the European Union is yet to play out and ramifications aren\u2019t fully known. Tensions in the Middle East have created the potential for market disruption. The recent health threat of the coronavirus is developing rapidly and how it will evolve it\u2019s still unknown. And the highly-charged election year in the U.S. brings additional uncertainties for companies to manage through.","In addition to that, we are facing discrete sales headwinds in aerospace as others are from the 737 MAX production delay in 2020, as Boeing has continued to recalibrate their expectations for its return to service and related production schedules. We are aligned with Boeing\u2019s most recent communications that assumes the 737 MAX returns to service roughly mid-year; however, the situation remains fluid.","So, while they\u2019re perhaps fewer indications of a broader base recession today, there remains several challenging and potentially fast-changing dynamics that create uncertainty in the macro and cautious in our short cycle business outlook. With these factors, short cycle outcomes for the year will be difficult to forecast and you\u2019ll see that we have a wider EPS guidance range than it\u2019s typical for us due to the range of outcomes that could result.","Our outlook assumes the Middle East remains relatively stable and that we can continue to deliver backlog and obtain new projects in the Middle East. We are assuming monetary policy remains stable and interest rates don\u2019t rise, lending support to the economy and that the U.S. election does not delay investment. We have not estimated the material impact as the coronavirus becomes more significant, which has already impacting aviation in particular flight hours and could also have a broader negative impact on supply chains in the economy as was experienced with the SARS outbreak.","We\u2019ve incorporated the latest communicated build rates, as I mentioned, of the 737 MAX into our own revenue outlook. So, knock-on effects of the overall Aero supply chain are yet to play out. So, while we have confidence in our market positions and have prepared ourselves for the year ahead, it\u2019s setting up as an equally and perhaps more uncertain years than the one we just completed.","Given that, let\u2019s move to Slide 7 and discuss the markets and the segment outlook. Starting with Aerospace & Defense remains strong, driven by stable budgets and we expect growth again in 2020, but in more moderate levels relative to the strong double digits we experienced in 2019. We continue to see healthy demand in business aviation, but we will have tougher comps and the business aviation OE.","We expect the aftermarket demand across commercial aerospace will continue to grow driven by flight hours and retrofit modifications and upgrades as well as the impact of older equipment remaining in service as a result of the delays in the MAX. That will partially be offset by the ADS-B phase-out. However, Aero will have sales headwinds from the MAX production delays. We\u2019re taking actions to try and mitigate this impact as best we can, including leveraging recent improvements in our supply base to accelerate production from our backlog, and we continue to monitor the MAX situation closely as you would expect.","Additionally, the impact for our earnings potential due to the MAX will be somewhat muted as potential aftermarket offsets with their higher profit levels compared to OE sales, will provide some support for segment margins. As a result of these dynamics across aerospace, we\u2019re expecting organic sales to be up low-to-mid single digits for the year as compared to the high single digits in the fourth quarter and the double-digit growth we experienced in the first report in 2019.","Now turning to SPS, we expect strong e-commerce and warehouse distribution macro trends to continue as customers seek and implement differentiated warehousing solutions to meet increased demand. These dynamics contributed to the robust Intelligrated orders in the second half of 2019 that will fuel warehouse automation sales growth in 2020, and we continued to expect strong services growth from our expanding installed base.","Excluding the warehousing market, industrial macro indicators remain weakened, which we expect will result in slower industrial safety sensing and IoT sales. Productivity products is executing their recovery plan as we mentioned and we continue to expect a turnaround in 2020 as destocking and with the return to growth expected in the second half of the year.","Overall, we expect SPS organic sales to be approximately flat to up low single digits and we expect SPS margin to begin recovering in 2020, driven by improvements in productivity product margins, productivity actions, and enhanced growth in software and services.","In HBT, following the spin of our Homes portfolio, our primary exposure is to the non-resi market, a construction market, and to the infrastructure and data center markets. While we\u2019re continuing to monitor the outlook across construction today, we anticipate non-residential market overall to remain flat to up modestly in 2020 and we are expecting HBT organic sales to be down slightly to up low single digits. We expect strength in commercial fire and modest growth and security products to continue.","In Building Solutions, we expect continued growth in airports vertical and we are focused on driving services growth to mitigate the impact of headwinds from lower energy performance contracts and software projects orders. building management system strength continues in the near-term, and driving better execution and pipeline development to deliver ongoing growth.","The PMT entered 2020 with a healthy long-cycle backlog, up high single digits in both UOP and HPS, driven by robust 2019 orders for UOP equipment and HPS projects. The oil and gas market outlook is similar to recent trends with continued softness in the U.S. midstream gas processing market, but a continued demand for mega projects.","Finally, with Advanced Materials, we expect continued growth from solstice in our flooring products business and better execution in specialty products. However, the illegal HFC imports into Europe continue to put pressure on growth, particularly for the first half of the year. Given these dynamics, in total, we expect PMT organic sales to be flat to up low single digits for the year.","Overall, the strength of Honeywell is our diversified portfolio and we headed to 2020 with a healthy long-cycle backlog, combined with strong operational playbooks, which will enable us to perform in another tough macro backdrop.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 8 and talk about how these dynamics come together for our 2020 financial guidance. We have an effective strategy at Honeywell, which enables us to continuously deliver on our financial commitments and that is not changing in 2020. our focus continues to be on smart investments for the future new product development and breakthrough initiatives to fuel growth, all with ongoing productivity rigor, and commercial and operational excellence to drive it.","These strengths embodied in our transformation initiatives, position us to deliver a solid year even with the unpredictability of the current market backdrop and uncertain short cycle macroenvironment. for 2020, we expect organic sales growth overall of 0% to 3%, which reflects our balance portfolio, diverse end market expectations, headwinds from the 737 MAX production delay and a cautious outlook on our short cycle businesses in this environment. We expect to expand margins 20 basis points to 50 basis points for the overall company consistent with our long-term framework. below-the-line pension and OPEB income in 2020 is expected to be approximately $830 million about \u2013 about a $200 million increase from the prior year or $0.20 of EPS, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail in the next slide.","In addition to pension income, other key planning items to take note of include weighted average share count of approximately 718 million shares, repositioning charges of $375 million to $500 million as we continue to fund high return projects and the remaining below-the-line items to be in the range of $205 million to $230 million of expense. Combined, this results in below-the-line income in the range of $100 million to $230 million for the year.","Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% for the year. All in, we\u2019re guiding EPS to be $8.60 to $9 per share of 5% to 10% up \u2013 5% to 10% adjusted, including the $0.20 benefit from higher pension income. We expect continued strong free cash flow generation with adjusted free cash flow of $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion to 2020, driven by high quality income growth and continued working capital improvements.","compared to 2019, we expect approximately, $500 million to $600 million of headwinds from higher plan CapEx investments, an additional payroll cycle due to the calendar and anticipated environmental and other payments. This cash generation equates to adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 102% to 107% excluding pension income. We believe excluding the non-cash pension income impact better reflects our operating performance and enables more appropriate comparisons to our peers.","We continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant capacity and desire to do more M&A as Darius mentioned. We do have a strong pipeline of opportunities, but in the absence of completing significant M&A, we\u2019ll continue to deploy additional capital to the repurchases of Honeywell shares.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 9 to discuss our 2020 earnings per share bridge compared to 2019. as I noted earlier, we\u2019re providing some slightly wider range than we typically do as a result of the number of variables that could impact the business over the next 12 months. Segment profit continues to be a key driver of our earnings growth, continued productivity improvements, commercial excellence, volume leverage, and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning, will contribute $0.10 to $0.45 per share.","We expect our share repurchase program, which has as a base case, the delivery of at least a 1% additional share count reduction to result in a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share year-over-year. Our expected tax rate of 21% to 22% is a range of a $0.07 headwind to a $0.04 benefit to EPS.","excluding pension income, below-the-line items are expected to be in a range of a $0.04 headwind to a $0.12 benefit per share, primarily driven by the range I mentioned on expected repositioning costs. The last item is the $0.20 increase from the higher pension income as a result of high investment returns in 2019 and lower discount rates in 2020. including that $0.20 tailwind, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $8.60 to $9 as I mentioned previously.","So, I\u2019d like to take a moment just to discuss the pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. As we talked about previously, we have de-risked our pension plans and in 2019, approximately 50% of the plan assets were more conservative fixed-income like assets, the other half being in return-seeking assets. as a result of the strong equity markets in 2019, those return-seeking assets earned approximately 21% in the year, resulting in over $3 billion of an increase in our pension asset base compared to last year. This higher asset base combined with lower discount rates is driving higher income in 2020, even with lower rates of return expected. Our pension is now 110% funded and we continue to derisk that with approximately 60% of our plan assets; now, it\u2019s fixed-income after 2020.","so, in summary while we\u2019re cautious about the macro backdrop and the short cycle outcomes are, once again, hard to predict. We entered the year with a healthy backlog in our long-cycle business. We have diversified end markets, a strong playbook, and a solid track record of execution and we\u2019re prepared to deliver another strong year with growth primarily from continued segment profit performance and our capital deployment strategy.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 for a preview of the first quarter. For the first quarter, we expect organic sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 2%, organically driven by growth in aerospace, continued strength and building products, UOP equipment and process automation, offset by headwinds from SPS and some of the other short cycle components of our portfolio.","Keep in mind, Q1 of 2019 with our strongest quarter of the year will be our most difficult comp. We expect commercial excellence, productivity rigor and the benefits from previously funded repositioning to drive continued segment profit and segment margin growth with 20 basis points to 50 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion resulting in segment margins in the range of 20.6 to 20.9 for the first quarter.","In the Aerospace, we continue to see demandable commercial aerospace and U.S. defense, supported by robust orders, growth and firm backlogs as I discussed. However, as we\u2019ve stated after five straight quarters of double-digit sales growth through 3Q 2019 and high single-digit growth in 4Q 2019. We expect organic sales growth rates to moderate in 2020. aero is facing sales headwinds as are others from Boeing\u2019s most recent recalibrations of the 737 MAX production delays, which will contribute to the more moderate growth rates as we enter the year, although we plan to mitigate some of that impact by accelerating production for our backlog.","In SPS, we expect distributor destocking to come to an end in productivity products, although return to growth will likely get second half outcome and we expect slow sales to continue in industrial safety. Intelligrated sales will be impacted by the project timing I mentioned in the first quarter due to a strong growth of approximately 50% last year at this time, but growth and robust orders in the second half of 2019, will contribute to more substantial sales growth in the following quarters.","In Building Technologies, we expect strength and commercial fire and security products, driven by demand in the Americas as well as continued strength in airports. We continue to see infrastructure including airports and data center projects as opportunities for strong growth in HBT. However, we expect software project sales in energy and other verticals within building solutions as we begin the year.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, we expect to see continued growth in products and services, and process automation and we expect a healthy demand for equipment in UOP. The headwinds in the Advanced Materials business from the legal imports of HFCs into Europe and lower specialty products demand driven by the slowdown in China, will persist in the early part of 2020. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% in the first quarter and average share count to be approximately 720 million shares. All of this results in earnings per share in the range of $2.02 to $2.07 representing growth of 5% to 8% earnings per share.","In summary, well positioned going into the first quarter with plans in place and ongoing initiatives across all businesses to drive productivity and margin expansion to mitigate the impacts of the mixed macroenvironment and the headwinds in the tough times compared to a year ago. We also continue to have significant balance sheet flexibility to generate strong returns through share repurchases and opportunistic M&A.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Darius, who will wrap up on Slide 11.","Darius Adamczyk","thanks, Greg. Overall, we are pleased with strong operational performance from our portfolio in 2019. We continue to execute our core priorities and we again, delivered on our commitment. We remain cautious on the macroenvironment of many factors, still very fluid for 2020 and significant uncertainty around short cycle demand of a balanced portfolio poised for continued performance despite macro headwinds and we continue to make significant progress of our transformation initiatives including Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital, and our Integrated Supply Chain.","Additionally, we\u2019re bringing innovative and connected offerings to market to fuel growth, which combined of our strong execution track record positions us well for 2020 and beyond.","With that Mark, let\u2019s move to Q&A.","Mark Bendza","Thank you, Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions. Abby, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Steve.","Greg Lewis","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just on the free cash, you mentioned a few items obviously, stronger in 2019, you mentioned a few items influencing 2020, kind of disagree with using an adjusted conversion metric, ultimately, cash per share is what matters. But what is the \u2013 is there anything kind of flip in 2021, so is 2020 to be viewed as kind of the base for growth or is there anything, timing-wise, that was pulled into 2019 that influence 2020, and then 2021 is kind of a more normal base to grow off of?","Greg Lewis","Yes. So, we\u2019ve always talked about our free cash flow conversion adjusted and we guided it last year, even in that, we have 95% to 100% adjusted. We highlighted the \u2013 both in our press release materials, both the way we had done previously adjusted and then we also adjusted for pension income, just to be transparent about both of those metrics, particularly with the increase in pension income going into 2020. So that\u2019s really the \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of \u2013 and both of those numbers are strongly above 100%. So, in terms of the 2019 into 2020 differences, what I tried to highlight in the \u2013 in the opening, Steve is really a couple of things. And first, we are going to spend a bit more CapEx as we go into 2020 and that\u2019s in support of our transformation initiatives in the supply chain, some additional capacity for some new products.","We also have just from a calendar perspective; we\u2019re going to have an extra payroll cycle in 2020. So that\u2019s just math and for us that\u2019s, call it, between $100 million and $200 million of headwind that will come and go in 2020. And then in terms of our environmental and other liabilities, those numbers will move a little bit and so there\u2019s probably a $100-ish million, maybe $200 million of flex that we have in there for 2020 also. So, those are really the major items that you\u2019ll see, but our cash flow performance and the overachievement that we had in the fourth quarter relative to our own expectations were heavily anchored around our working capital improvements.","We did a tremendous job with our commercial and collections teams on the receivable side; we\u2019ve been doing a lot on transforming how we do credit to collections. And then we talked about inventory being our bugaboo for some time now and if you look at the free cash flow statement, you\u2019ll see for the first time in a while, we actually were able to get cash from inventory as we\u2019re specifically starting to tune some of those dials in a more disciplined way, with again, some of the things that Torsten and the team are driving from a transformation perspective. So Darius, I don\u2019t know if you want to add.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. just to add a couple of things, Steve. And maybe, just to add a couple of things on a year-over-year basis and these are not dramatic impacts. but overall, our cash outlays are going to be slightly higher in 2020 versus 2019 due to restructuring. So that\u2019s probably another factor. I wouldn\u2019t get too focused about a baseline of 2020. obviously we have some CapEx to spend, which is the driver in our payment cycle, that\u2019s an extra one. So that\u2019s just a math worked outside. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that 2020 announced the baseline. But I do want to highlight something and I think it\u2019s a point that\u2019s been missed completely, which is if you look at the cash flow generation of this company versus what it was three years ago, we\u2019re about $2 billion higher on 15% to 20% in the last sales growth. I think that point has been just missed completely and I\u2019m extraordinarily proud of the team in terms of what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in terms of cash generation. After all, that gives us more firepower to extra reinvest in the business or pass back to our shareowners or likely both. And I think that\u2019s the thing that really matters.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So just \u2013 that makes sense. So basically, a few hundred million dollars that is kind of timing related in 2020. Is that \u2013 is that kind of how we should think about at a high level?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I\u2019m sorry.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last quick one, just on HBT, what\u2019s going on there with \u2013 I mean, you guys had a pretty positive Investor Day and now kind of framing a year with a little bit of a decline at the low end, what kind of popped up, is that kind of performance contracting out of JCI talked about that as being weak as well. What\u2019s kind of the drag there?","Darius Adamczyk","That\u2019s exactly it, Steve. We basically are energy contracts or performance contracts primarily driven by the government sector, we\u2019ve seen a substantial drop-off in that segment of the business in orders that has not been sort of the focus of the government sector lately and that\u2019s been a problem. That\u2019s been a significant business for us in the past and that\u2019s dropped off. Yes, the orders there have dropped off double-digit. So that\u2019s probably the one problem area that we\u2019ve seen in terms of orders, but that \u2013 we\u2019re always going to have an issue somewhere, but if we look at our long cycle orders for the quarter across Honeywell, 15% growth, I don\u2019t want to sort of bypass that back in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. So, I think it was an incredibly successful quarter from a long-cycle orders perspective. And just to maybe, quote you another fact. In a place like China, orders up north of 20% and backlog up nearly 50%. So, I viewed this quarter as just an outstanding from Honeywell winning in the marketplace.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One quick one, what\u2019s your year-end share count? And then I\u2019ll leave it there, just a year-end ending share count. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks a lot.","Greg Lewis","I think we\u2019ve talked about 718.","Steve Tusa","Yes.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Scott Davis","A lot of \u2013 a lot of information here and super helpful, I think this is the first quarter, where we\u2019ve, at least for the 2020 guide, where supply chain seems to be a \u2013 starting to become a tailwind and I guess my question really is, Darius \u2013 has this become a linear tailwind, meaning you get some benefit in 2020, some in 2021, 2022 or is there some sort of a step-up that occurs over time as you kind of post these investment cycles?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think it\u2019s a gradual improvement. I think I was extraordinarily pleased with what we saw in terms of our inventory management. Inventory has been a bit of a bugaboo for Honeywell for a long time and we actually made some really nice progress in the second half of the year. I don\u2019t think there are any miracles for us out there, but I expect that progress to continue and it was reflected in our cash flow for Q4. And also, we\u2019re focused on our delivery, our quality and so on, and Torsten and his team are doing a really nice job driving those improvements and I expect a gradual improvement year-over-year and then transformation. I mean we dropped our fixed cost footprint in 2019. We have an even more aggressive plan for 2020 and 2021. So, you\u2019re going to kind of continue to see that progress on fixed cost reduction, which obviously, makes us a much more variable cost company, which is something that I very much desire.","Scott Davis","Yes. Super helpful and I don\u2019t think you mentioned the word M&A or deals of any course in the prepared remarks and was that \u2013 I may have missed it, of course, but was that purposeful in the context, there\u2019s just not a lot relatively expensive market out there or is it just not part of the planning right now, or deals are going to get announced when they get announced?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, we did do Rebellion in December, which is a big acquisition, but really an interesting one, which is basically, the use of imaging for advanced gas detection. So, it\u2019s very much a technology-oriented company in the industrial segment, which fits really, really well with industrial safety, but also, fits well with Productivity Solutions and our HPS business. So, we\u2019re very thrilled to get that one.","In terms of M&A, we continue to be very active, I can tell you and the environment we\u2019re seeing is, yes, the prices are elevated, but what I can also tell you is that kind of, because there is so much cash awash and so much capital to deploy, we\u2019re seeing very aggressive sort of due diligence in the kind of terms that others are willing to accept. So, I think we\u2019re assessing that because we\u2019re going to continue to be a very cautious company and really study the market, but we also have to kind of look within ourselves in terms of, you know what\u2019s risk that\u2019s reasonable, what isn\u2019t. So it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a very robust M&A marketplace and we expect to do deals in 2020, certainly.","Scott Davis","Helpful. Best of luck guys. Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Scott.","Greg Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Maybe...","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just a first question around the CapEx hike that you mentioned. It sounded pretty substantial, so maybe give us some idea of how long capital spending stays elevated and also in terms of the split of the CapEx increase maybe between growth focused on new product initiatives versus some of those supply chain internal self-help measures?","Greg Lewis","Sure. So, we\u2019ve been around $800 million, as you know, for the last couple of years and it goes, like in the $820 million or $830 million or so. And so, when I say elevated, this is not massive increases, we\u2019re talking about $100 million, $100 million-ish type of increases year-on-year, and I would say it\u2019s probably 50-50 split between increases relative to the transformation and increases relative to some new capacity for some of our new product launches that we\u2019re doing. So, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 this is not like we\u2019re making one massive block investment and something huge here. But as we go through this transformation, in the supply chain, it\u2019s going to require \u2013 it\u2019s going to require capital. So 50-50, I would say and think about it in sort of like a $100 million, $150 million type of potential increase year-on-year.","Darius Adamczyk","And by the way, just to add to that, the IRR in total on these investments, substantially north of 30%. So, I mean if you think about that kind of a return versus M&A, whenever we\u2019re going to see those kinds of returns, I\u2019m more than happy to deploy more capital because it\u2019s going to make us a better company in the long-term. So, I think that this increase in capital, I think, should be viewed as a positive, not a negative.","Greg Lewis","Yes. And again, we talked about our free cash conversion, just to get back to that for a minute. We\u2019ve said many times, we are not like pinpointed on a $100 million, if we\u2019ve got good investments, and we\u2019re going to make them. So\u2026","Julian Mitchell","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my second question just around Safety and Productivity Solutions, not so much on the Productivity Solutions piece because I think that\u2019s well understood. But maybe on Safety, that did rollover in the fourth quarter. Just maybe give us some understanding of \u2013 was that a surprise to you and what do you think this year will look like in terms of Safety sales?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean there it\u2019s the markets. The industrial markets overall have been relatively soft. We don\u2019t think that there is anything sort of unusual going on in that business, it\u2019s a reflection of that. I mean it\u2019s not \u2013 obviously it\u2019s a market that\u2019s flattish to down, some of the segments that we play in, we saw that. So this is probably one why we have some uncertainty about the short cycle, that\u2019s one of the tougher businesses to call for us. We are concerned about what\u2019s happening in China around coronavirus and so on and not just the impact in China, but really the impact on the global industrial production, because your global supply chain. So, I think you have to look beyond just China. But we\u2019re optimistic that the markets are going to improve, but there isn\u2019t inherently something unusual going on in those \u2013 in that business.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thanks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Andy.","Greg Lewis","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Kaplowitz","Darius or Greg, just focusing on your guidance for 2020. To the extent you can, could you elaborate on the headwinds you could incur from the MAX, either growth or margin and obviously it\u2019s too early to tell the coronavirus impact on commercial aftermarket. But there are lot of moving parts in that business, whether it\u2019s a brief decline in flight hours, or the ADS-B mandate, you\u2019ve had strong RMUs, connected initiatives are doing well. So, how do you think about the resiliency of commercial Aero aftermarket in 2020?","Greg Lewis","So, obviously the \u2013 what Boeing is doing with the MAX return to service has and will have an impact on the aftermarket performance and I think we were all \u2013 we\u2019re all aware, they fly the older planes longer, and so therefore, has increased demand in that sense. When you think about our guide for what\u2019s happening with the math, you should think about \u2013 we\u2019re going to have probably a low-to-mid single-digit headwind to the Aerospace growth because of the production schedule changes. And so we talked last year about it being rather minimal because the numbers were smaller. But now with Boeing announcing the stoppage of production and their mid-year return to service and their ramp up, their re-ramp, we are going to be taking down our deliveries to them much more significantly than we did in the back half of 2019.","So, as we talked about, we will try to utilize some of our other existing backlog. And hopefully the supply base can provide us some additional material inputs, so that we can defer labor and try to serve some of our other customers in a way to offset some of that, but it\u2019s hard to say how that\u2019s going to work out. That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re \u2013 we are being a bit cautious, because that\u2019s all very fresh news, as you know, within weeks and so the impacts to even our supply chain is unknown. So...","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, the revenue impact is meaningful. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 think about kind of a mid triple-digit impact for millions of dollars that obviously we can \u2013 we think we can offset some of that, both through RMUs and backlog reduction, but it\u2019s from a revenue perspective, it\u2019s not an insignificant \u2013 and by the way, we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re completely aligned to Boeing\u2019s perspective. So it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in our current outlook.","Andy Kaplowitz","Thanks for that guys. And, Darius you already mentioned China in Q4 was pretty strong in terms of orders, but maybe you can walk us around the world, which you did in Q4 and what your expectations are for 2020. We are understanding that there\u2019s uncertainty out there. I think in Q3, China and U.S. year grew strong, you\u2019re expecting India to come back. So, what happened to these regions in Q4?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Yes, interesting Q4, I mean, obviously, China was a highlight, both kind of on the orders growth rate. And by the way, China is accelerating for us. So, you have seen a higher rate of growth in Q2, Q3, Q4. Q4 is even higher. So we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there, the orders give us. So actually, China is one of the really nice storage for us. The other place to highlight, and I think, I\u2019ve talked about this before, which is Latin America. I mean, Latin America was also up high-single digits and obviously we have to be taking a lot of share there given the fact that a lot of those economies aren\u2019t exactly robust and they\u2019re struggling. So, I\u2019m very, very pleased with what\u2019s happened there.","Middle East continues to be a region of strength for us. We had some tougher comps, but think low-to-mid single-digit kind of growth rate. Probably that the low light for us was Western Europe. That\u2019s been kind of soft in Q4. I think a couple of the countries that I\u2019d look to get that were particularly soft would be Italy and the Netherlands, which were weak overall. India was okay in Q4. Frankly, it was a little bit lower than we had hoped, the low-to-mid single-digit kind of growth numbers. There is some \u2013 we have \u2013 that\u2019s a country of strength for us, but slightly below our expectations. And Russia actually did quite well for us as well in the segments that we play in. So sort of a mixed story but the highlight certainly being China both on the actual performance and the bookings growth.","Andy Kaplowitz","Very interesting, thanks guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Couple of quick ones from me. Just on the productivity products. Darius, a little surprised to hear you\u2019re not expecting a return to growth to the back half \u2013 into the back half, the comps are very easy in the first half. Do you feel like you have the product to actually drive the business and kind of take a little bit better control of your destiny relative to kind of just what the noise is going on perhaps in the channel?","Darius Adamczyk","So, to be clear, I am expecting a return to growth in productivity products. So, I think we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve got our signals across somewhere. And just to give you some very specific data points. The sales out in the channel for productivity products has grown every quarter last year. More or less normalized our channel position now by the end of 2019. We actually saw growth in the scanning portfolio in productivity products and we\u2019ve been able to secure a couple of good wins. The toughest comp still for productivity products is Q1. We anticipated that. It\u2019s not news. But as we get further and further out the year, I do expect growth in productivity products.","So \u2013 and I have the data to \u2013 that gives me that confidence. So that\u2019s not a wish and a hope. I have some data points that says that, that\u2019s a reasonable outcome to expect, unless of course something goes wrong with the market. But actually, I\u2019m very pleased with the kind of progress that\u2019s been made, the team that we now have there in place and the products that we have to the marketplace.","Jeff Sprague","All right. I was just going by Slide 7 there on the second half. Just thinking about the guide overall, when you read what you\u2019ve put on Slide 6, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being super conservative, but then when you talk and with the range, it does in a way feel conservative. Could you just address that? I mean zero at the low end feels pretty conservative, particularly if you pull out a zero in Q1, which is your toughest comparison, right? Then you probably are on a path for something better than that as the year unfolds.","Darius Adamczyk","Well, Jeff, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our approach in terms of forecasting and outlooks, which is, we\u2019re not \u2013 when I\u2019m not sure of something, or myself and Greg are not sure of something, we\u2019re going to give you a wider range. And we\u2019re not going to promise things that we don\u2019t either don\u2019t have visibility or can\u2019t do.","I would also tell you a couple of other things. I mean, there are quite a few unknowns, I mean the coronavirus right now is an example, is something that\u2019s very difficult for us to predict around the impact. I mean if things go back and our factories reopen Monday or a week from Monday, which is kind of the schedule, then maybe it\u2019s conservative. What if they don\u2019t? What if this continues to spread? What if it gets worse? That impact could be substantially worse than what we\u2019re expecting. The short cycle is a little bit unpredictable. We talked about \u2013 there was a prior question industrial safety, it\u2019s tough to call that right now.","As I look at a lot of the reports from a lot of the shorter cycle-oriented peers, they exactly have not been stellar. I mean, so we\u2019re trying to call it, I don\u2019t know about conservatively. We don\u2019t know and we don\u2019t know that much about short cycle right now. We\u2019re going to kind of err on certainly, a little bit wider range and we\u2019ll see what happens, and obviously like we do every year, as the year progresses, we\u2019ll update you and we\u2019ll refresh our guidance. I\u2019m very happy with our long cycle. I mean a 10% growth in the backlog is very good. So that gives me some confidence and we\u2019ll see how the year progresses.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. And on the long cycle, just one more if I could. Obviously projects are normally subject to delays and the like. But as it stands now, is most of that backlog deliverable in 2020? It\u2019s tied to expected activity in 2020?","Darius Adamczyk","No, it\u2019s \u2013 some of it is beyond 2020. I mean, we sort of expect the normal conversion cycle. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 for example, some of the Intelligrated backlog just goes all the way into 20.","Greg Lewis","15 months.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, 15, 18 months, so it\u2019s longer cycle. But nevertheless, I mean, the makeup of it isn\u2019t dramatically different in terms of execution versus 20 \u2013 end of 2018. So it kind of looks the same. It\u2019s always more than one year. So it\u2019s not inconsistent, what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Jeff Sprague","Great, thank you very much.","Mark Bendza","Hey, Abby, I think we can take two more questions.","Operator","Okay, thank you. We will take our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks for the question. Good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","Good morning. So my first question is just around, you guys talked about short cycle as obviously another item of uncertainty in 2020. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw from short-cycle trends in 4Q throughout the quarter? And was there maybe any signs of like weakening throughout December and into January that gives you concern into the first quarter or have you seen more like stabilization?","Greg Lewis","I would tell you that as we \u2013 as we exited the year, it was relatively stable. But I would tell you that also January with the China situation is going to be one we\u2019re going to have to read into pretty closely. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t highlight a huge problem to solve at this point just yet, but certainly there have been some weakening trends as we exited December and into January in a few places. Again, China, on the short cycle is one we\u2019re going to watch very closely. Darius mentioned a couple of areas in Europe in particular as well.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. Thanks, Greg. And then secondly just around Process, if you guys could talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing from a backlog perspective and areas of strength. One of your big competitors talked about some big LNG projects coming through recently, so it would be great to hear where the strength is coming from for you guys?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, I think for us it\u2019s probably three main components of strengths. By the way, HPS had a terrific quarter, double-digit orders growth, the business is doing incredibly well. We\u2019re thrilled with their performance. But specifically LNGs coming through some of the mega refining petrochemical complexes is another place of growth and we\u2019re starting to give you a bit more in the renewable segment. That\u2019s actually one of the focus areas for PMT in general. And we\u2019re seeing some improved activity for \u2013 in renewables. So I would highlight those three as areas where we\u2019re seeing growth with a terrific bookings and orders outlook in Q4.","Nicole DeBlase","Thanks, Darius. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys. Thanks for letting me in. I appreciate it.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","So, yes, we\u2019ve obviously covered a lot of ground and I appreciate all the detail by the way. I just want to clarify on the payroll cycle. Greg, you called out $100 million, $200 million, is that just a cash impact or does that also impact \u2013","Darius Adamczyk","That\u2019s right. Payroll.","Greg Lewis","Yes, it\u2019s payroll, that\u2019s our payroll.","Nigel Coe","Right. So was that just cash or was that earnings?","Greg Lewis","No, no that\u2019s cash. That\u2019s just \u2013","Nigel Coe","Business cash, okay.","Greg Lewis","Generally, at the end of the year, we carry an accrual. The way the calendar falls that are repaid every two weeks on a Friday, happens all the time, the exact same way. It happens next year, the Friday is going to be ready for the year-end.","Nigel Coe","Understood. Thank you very much. And then my main question is on the 20 to 50 bps of segment margin expansion, how does that look by segments? And the spirit of my question is, should we expect SPS to be sort of a heavy contributor to that, maybe Aerospace is a little bit less, so any color on that. And then kind of the subtext here is, you\u2019re obviously doing a lot of restructuring this year, up to $0.5 billion in your plan. Is that all cash? And what kind of paybacks are you getting on that spend?","Greg Lewis","Yes, so let me unpack that. First of all, we\u2019re not giving segment margin expansion guidance individually. We should expect, of course that SPS will improve, given the degradation we saw in 2019. They\u2019ve obviously got a lot more room to run given that depression we had this year. The other three businesses, I think all have, I\u2019ll call it, equal opportunity on margin improvement overall. So that\u2019s the way I would think about \u2013 think about that from a segment perspective.","As it relates to the restructuring, a high percentage of the restructuring that we have on the balance sheet is cash-oriented, and we do expect that is going to essentially get carried out over 2.5 to 3 years time. As Darius mentioned, a heavy amount of that would be in 2020 and then in 2021 and a little bit of a tail off into 2022. But as it relates to the projects, you can think about them really in sort of two categories, those that are really tied to, call it, site consolidations. Those are above the cost of capital, clearly the high-single digit, low-double digit type returns, those that are more associated with, call it, back office productivity and organizational redevelopment and so on. Those are carrying far higher returns to them. So that\u2019s kind of what we are looking at.","Nigel Coe","Great, thank you. And one quick clarification on the share count reduction question. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve got a whole lot dialed in for 2020, about $1.5 billion by my calculations. Is that the right zone?","Greg Lewis","Yes, that\u2019s in the ballpark. Again, we are at a minimum going to buyback 1% of our shares for sure. And then as we discuss this, if the year progresses, and we\u2019re not seeing a lot of M&A activity and it looks like an attractive opportunity as we did here in 2019, we won\u2019t be afraid to go back into the market and scoop up some of our own shares.","Nigel Coe","Great, thanks, guys.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","I want to thank our shareholders for continued support of Honeywell. We remain focused on continuing to outperform for our shareowners, our customers and our employees. We have delivered on our commitments, strong results each quarter and continue to make great progress on our growth and transformation initiatives. We have a great portfolio and we continue to execute well. I\u2019m excited for 2020 and we expect another high-performance year for Honeywell. Thank you all for listening and have a great weekend.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"10474":["Honeywell International Inc.

Davis - Barclays Capital","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Operator","Good day everyone, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Leo, and good morning. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. Today's call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter, share with you our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, and finally we'll leave time for your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. A very good start to 2013. EPS in the quarter was $1.16 and that\u2019s normalizing for tax, that came in a penny above the high end of our guidance range and up 12% driven by the strong margin performance across the businesses. And we accomplished this in a slow growth macro environment that was really coupled with some particularly challenging prior year comps. And I think there is a nice reinforcement of our conservative sales planning process and the results you can get from that.","Sales of $9.3 billion were aligned with guidance and like we talked about during investor day, it demonstrates the importance of a balanced portfolio. Now I say that because while we saw our headwinds from lower defense spending, lower European auto production and generally challenging comps, we also saw modest signs of improvement at several of our key short cycle ECS businesses and across another quarter from EOP, not just in sales but in what the future is for sale.","Similar to prior quarters, EPS growth was driven by strong margin expansion. We were up 100 basis points to 16.2%, and this was driven by cost management or productivity. That focus on material cost and remaining conservative in our census planning. This discipline, along with our considerable amount of seed planting, helped us to deliver these results while maintaining our investments for the future.","Now as a result of that success, we are raising our full year pro forma EPS guidance by a nickel on the low end, making our new range $4.80 to $4.95, up 7% to 11% versus prior year. This reflects our strong first quarter performance as well as our confidence in our ability to drive continued margin expansion. However, also as we\u2019ve been saying since October, we want to ensure we\u2019re remaining balanced in our planning and as a result we\u2019re maintaining a range that incorporates possible risks and opportunities.","We\u2019re achieving these results while continuing our investments in the future or that seed planting that you always hear us talking about. In the quarter we proactively funded over $30 million of new restructuring projects, building on a healthy pipeline of projects as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. This is more than we originally expected which again speaks to the strength of our first quarter results. We also continue to invest in stuff that\u2019s really just terrific when it comes to new products and technologies and that are winning with our customers.","As an example, Honeywell SmartPath was selected by the Airport Authority of India or AAI to be part of a pilot project for satellite based precision approach and landings at the Chennai International Airport. As you know airport congestion remains a major issue globally and SmartPath will support this increasing demand by reducing delays, lowering operations costs for airlines and increasing traffic throughput. Think of it as like the Honeywell operating system for an airport so same concept.","We also saw a number of new wins from UOP, building on our already record backlog levels and setting them up for a multiyear cycle of continued up performance. For example UOP announced its 12th all fixed project win since the beginning of 2011 driven by the renaissance in petrochemical investments spurred by low natural gas prices.","Now if we take a step back for a moment, we see ourselves in what continues to be a slow growth microenvironment. We do see some reasons to be optimistic on the horizon, but we also see plenty of reasons to continue to remain cautious. For example U.S and European sales were as expected in the quarter. However, China saw a weak start to the year, reflecting a government austerity and a concerted attempt to contain growth. That being said, the majority of our businesses there are quite healthy. Inventory levels are returning to normal and order rates are improving, particularly in our long cycle businesses, signaling our modest recovery over the remainder of the year.","As we\u2019ve said before, taking a conservative approach to topline planning helps ensure we deliver the results you\u2019ve come to expect. You can expect we\u2019ll be ready to capitalize on the opportunity if and when things do pick up. In the meantime, we\u2019ll keep following the playbook you\u2019ve come to expect from us. Seed planting for future growth, including investing in our businesses, launching a bunch of new products, global expansion and driving productivity through our key enablers so we can deliver this year, next year and beyond that.","So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.","David Anderson","Thank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for your participation. Let\u2019s go to slide entitled 1-2, 2013 results. I\u2019ll just take you through the summary highlights. Again sales of $9.3 billion were approximately flat year over year on a reported basis and in line with our prior guidance, down about 1% on an organic basis. So adjusting for acquisitions and adjusting for currency. As expected, challenging comps in aerospace and also in transportation systems where headwinds in the quarter, although we expect these comps to get easier in the second half of the year. We\u2019ll talk about that a little bit more.","Segment profit for the quarter was up 7%. Segment margins expanded as Dave said, 100 basis points to 16.2%, representing really exceptional sales conversion in the quarter. We saw margin expansion in three of the four SPGs and we\u2019re going to take you through that in just a moment. But PMT you\u2019ll note in particular benefited from a strong UOP quarter as we expected.","Global line, largely those numbers largely as anticipated and consistent with our prior guidance. You recall the pension favorability we have this year, which was essentially redeployed in the quarter to fund smart repositioning projects which will help continue to drive productivity in a slow growth environment.","The first quarter effective tax rate at 23.1% planned, against the planned 26.5% for the full year. The lower tax rate was driven by the passage of the U.S. tax extenders earlier this year, and that came just late enough to not be a 2012 benefit and early enough to be a first quarter 2013 benefit. That\u2019s going to correct and will be offset later in the year and we are still planning the 26.5% for the full year. So EPS of $1.21 reported was up 16%, after normalizing of the 26.5% ETR, EPS would have been $1.16, up 12% and above the high end of the guidance driven by strong segment margin expansion in the quarter.","And finally, free cash flow for the quarter, $327 million, was up 9% versus prior year and right on track to our full year guidance. Let's go through each of the businesses in turn, start with slide number five with aerospace. Sales for aero down 1% in the first quarter again as expected. U.S. defense and space program wrap down as well as tough prior year comps in the commercial business, both contributed to a challenging top line sales quarter for aerospace. Commercial OE sales were up 1% driven by 9% growth in air transport in regional as a result the continued strong OE build rate. BGA OE, on the other hand was down primarily driven by backlog [brought] down in the first quarter of 2012.","Commercial aftermarket sales were down 3% versus prior year, a little color on that to help you understand what we are seeing today. It makes a lot of sense to look back at where we were this time last year. You recall in the first quarter of 2012, Honeywell commercial aftermarket sales were actually up 16%, which at that time was our eighth straight quarter also of double-digit spares increases. Of course we benefitted from strong win rates in airline selectables, due aircraft spares provisioning, favorable platform mix as well as higher than normal engine maintenance events and also some discretionary [end use] sales.","The key point is, obviously lapping a very strong period last year. Fast forward to today, and as we foreshadowed a year ago, the aftermarket growth has continued to moderate and as expected this quarter, we experienced decline in spares volumes mostly as a result of the strong performance we had last year but also as a result of the airline buyer behavior. However, the flight hours continue to be positive and we feel confident we will see aftermarket growth in the remainder of this year.","Defense and space sales were down 1%. U.S. sales were unfavorably impacted by the anticipated program wrap downs and these were partially offset by good growth in the international market. Looking at segment profit for aerospace, you can see margins up 80 basis points to a robust 18.9% in the quarter, largely driven by commercial excellence and also continued productivity net of inflation including the absence of the prior year unfavorable you will recall of the Hawker bankruptcy. Partially offset by lower commercial and aftermarket volume.","So with those highlights for aerospace, let's go to slide six, automation and control solutions. So ACS, sales were roughly flat for the quarter on both a reported and organic basis. Regionally, Europe was a little better than we expected back in January while the U.S. and Asia were a little bit worse. Let's just take a little bit closer look at the ACS businesses.","For ESS, energy, safety and security, sales were up 2% driven by good growth in ECC as a result of a more normal winter heating season, and also continued strong residential market condition and new product introductions in security products. Process solutions sales were down 2%, driven by challenging comps. It's really as a result of several large projects which have been steadily ramping down over the course of the prior year and into the first quarter of this year. Of the good news here for process solutions is that project pipeline remains very strong, the backlog is converting at a higher margin and it's partially as a result of being more selective in what we bid, as well as the organizational improvements we have made in the last year.","In fact, HPS margins were up strongly in the quarter. So a positive margin story for HPS and the contribution to ACS as a whole.","For BSD, Building Solutions and Distribution, sales were down 2% driven by several large project completions in 2012, coupled with a remaining U.S energy retrofit market, partially offset by continued growth in our Americas distribution business.","Now segment margin for ACS expanded 80 basis points to 13.8% in the quarter, the performance was driven again by commercial excellence by operational improvements and also by continued cost management and of course the benefit of previously completed restructuring actions which of course are continuing to flow through and pay dividends.","Let\u2019s go now to slide 7 PMT and just the highlights for Performance Materials and Technologies. Now UOP sales were up 34% reported 10% organic in the quarter, primarily driven by increased petrochemical catalyst shipments and also equipment sales growth. UOP also continued to build backlog, now approximately $2.9 billion, reflecting an organic increase on both a year over year as well as on a sequential basis.","On the other hand, Advanced Materials was pretty soft in the quarter largely as expected. Sales were down 9% versus prior year driven by lower volumes in Advanced Materials as a result of planned plant outages in both resins and chemicals as well as in flooring products. Those outages had roughly a 6% negative impact on sales for the quarter. We will not expect these to have a significant impact on sales importantly for the remainder of the year.","Additionally, while we continue to see price rise pressure in resins and chemicals, the in markets there remain relatively stable and we exited the quarter with a robust order book supporting continued future growth outlook.","The segment margin for PMT was 21.8%, representing an increase of 200 basis points versus last year. again the strength of UOP sales in addition to favorable price net of inflation, partially offset by lower volume in Advanced Materials as a result of the plant outages that I referenced and also the continued investments that we make for growth in PMT.","So now to slide 8, transportation systems. TS, the sales decline was 4% in the quarter, year over year improvement over the fourth quarter performance. We continue to see European light vehicle production decline for approximately 10% as auto sales remain depressed across most of Europe, including now France, Germany and Spain. TS however has had the benefit of new launches, partially offsetting these declines and with higher turbo gas penetration in both North America as well as in China and while we expect a difficult environment in Europe to persist, the comps of course are going to get easier in the second half of the year.","Segment margins for TS were down 50 basis points, driven by the lower sales and also the investments we\u2019re making to improve friction materials, partially offset by productivity actions. Overall TS continues to execute well in a difficult microenvironment it\u2019s in, illustrated by maintaining margins at a solid level, despite western EU light vehicle sales at 17 year lows is driven really this productivity by continued efficiency improvements and also flexibility.","Let\u2019s now with that review of the businesses for the first quarter go to slide 9 and give you the brief highlights for our outlook for the second quarter. Again for the second quarter we\u2019re expecting modest sales growth roughly flat up 2% in the $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion range. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23, up 4% to 9% when normalizing for the tax rate in both years.","Let\u2019s take a look then at each of the businesses, just the highlights of the revenue outlook for each of the businesses in the second quarter. Aerospace we\u2019re expecting sales to be roughly flat, with modest growth in commercial partially offset by mid-single digit decline in Defense and Space. We continue to monitor after market activity in relation to global flying hours and airline inventory levels and we\u2019ll see spares comps improve as we move through the remainder of the year.","For ACS in the second quarter, we think that\u2019s going to play out much like the first, with sales flat up 2% driven by a modest organic improvement in ESS, and the timing of Intermec, which is expected to close by the end of June. This was partially offset by continued slowness in both HPS and BSD. We anticipate continued strong conversion in ACS with margins up year-over-year despite the potentially dilutive impact of Intermec in the quarter. And as a reminder, ACS margins for the year are estimated to be approximately 14.5% including 40 basis points of Intermec related dilution reflecting the acceleration we have seen in margin expansion here in the last couple of years.","PMT for the second quarter, we are expecting sales to be up 12% to 15%, which would equate to mid-single digit growth organically. UOP is expected to have another strong sales quarter, driven by the Thomas Russell acquisition and also higher equipment sales. Again as a reminder, UOP saw very strong licensing revenues in the second quarter of 2012 which are not expected to repeat at those levels this year. And as a result we expect PMT margins in the second quarter to be lower both sequentially as well as year-over-year.","Finally, in transportation systems, we are expecting sales to be flat to down slightly. EU light vehicle production is expected to be down approximately mid-single digits, with turbo volumes approximately flat sequentially. There is a possibility we could see low single digit volume growth which would be terrific. And this is reflected at the high end of the range, the revenue range for TS in the second quarter. So as you can see, very good performance despite a slow growth macro environment, recorded, as Dave said, by a strong focus on driving productivity and of course the balanced portfolio which gives us confidence in this outlook.","And now before going to the full year, I just want to take a few minutes to just say a few words and give you an update on NARCO. So on slide number ten, as we discussed in our December outlook call, and this is really the highlights of what we discussed but just to really make sure that we are reminding you of this, the long awaited NARCO trust formation is happening. And specifically, the NARCO bankruptcy plan is expected to be effective around April 30. And thus, we think it's likely the trust will be established in the second quarter, which means we will start seeing some trust formation cash outflows this quarter.","A couple of things we would like to take a moment to point out. First, we continue to estimate the 2013 cash outflows to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million pretax or $120 million to $170 million, which is shown on this slide, after tax. The outflows in 2014 are also expected to be roughly in that range, $175 million to $225 million, net of tax and net of insurance recoveries. And as you can see, 2013 as well as '14 in the left hand side of the chart, slide ten, reflect the high watermark for cash outflows as a significant portion of the early outflows are carryover of preexisting claims yet to be paid.","Now beyond 2013 and '14, we expect the cash outflows to reduce and stabilize subject to the annual payment cap on new claims of $140 million pretax, or approximately $60 million again net of taxes and insurance receipts. Now at this point we feel we are adequately reserved with over $1 billion remaining for NARCO specifically. So no P&L impact envisioned for some time. It's going to take several years of experience operating the trust to discern certain trends and claims activity and then reevaluate reserve levels.","So key takeaway number one is no change to the cash or earnings guidance for 2013 for this year. Key takeaway number two is this level of funding is very manageable, it will not impact our ability to assertively and positively redeploy cash to build value in other areas. We have been smart in how we have negotiated the trust terms, specifically with Honeywell's level of engagement in trust operating procedures and audit rights over the claims payment processes, in addition to the ongoing cap on new claims and you saw that in terms of that post 2014 presentation, all of which serve to differentiate the NARCO Trust from any other. Of course we\u2019ll continue to update you on this as events unfold.","So let\u2019s now turn to slide 11 and take a minute on the full 2013 guidance summary. As you can see, some small puts and takes based on what we\u2019ve discussed today, but very much in line with your expectation. Sales expected to be up 3% to 4%, 1% to 2% on an organic basis. We\u2019re still assuming a year rate of 1.25 at the midpoint which we believe remains a prudent assumption in light of the volatility we\u2019ve all been experiencing.","Now the revenue forecast for the full year is down slightly from our previous expectations. Really has to do with the assumption regarding the timing of the Intermec close. Previously we were assuming June 1. Now we\u2019re assuming June 30. We\u2019ve incorporated the full impact obviously of sequestration. And then obviously just the continued outlook for slower growth in the macro economy, with increased segment margins importantly for the full year, 10 basis points on both the low and the high end. These increases reflect our strong first quarter performance and our continued confidence in driving margin expansion through our enablers and our ongoing proactive funding of repositioning.","The full year tax rate is still expected to be 26.5%, which is consistent with prior years. So as I mentioned earlier, we would expect the first quarter tax favorability to be offset in the second half of the year. So taking into account these items, we\u2019re raising our full year EPS guidance at the low end by a nickel, resulting in a new range of $4.80 to $4.95, up 7% to 11% versus 2012. And as you can see, we\u2019re still expecting around $3.7 billion of free cash flow so no change there. And as Dave said earlier, we believe a very balanced outlook for the year, but taking into account the good start that we saw in the first quarter.","So with that let\u2019s go to slide 12, just a brief wrap up before we turn it over to Elena and to you for Q&A. the first quarter obviously reflected another strong quarter for Honeywell and like most top performing companies, we continued to set high expectations and we continued to deliver. We remain confident in our 2013 outlook. We continue to plan for growth in a low growth environment, with mix orders trend by business and region, which is to say we\u2019re not counting on a big second half recovery to deliver strong results.","We\u2019re focused on executing our proven playbook, driving sustainable operating leverage, progress on key productivity initiatives in addition continuing to fund smart new restructuring projects that will yield incremental savings in 2013 and 2014. And finally we\u2019ve planted a lot of seeds for the future, with a strong portfolio aligned to favorable macro trends. These are all intact. Industrial reinvestment, infrastructure expansion and renewal, continued urbanization combined with a growing middle global middle class. These trends are going to continue to build and we\u2019re going to continue to leverage those. We\u2019ve got the right people. We\u2019re developing the right products for the right market at the right value to capitalize on these trends.","So we look forward to global growth returning to more normal levels, but we\u2019re not beholden to it. We\u2019re going to keep doing what we always do, executing on our business strategies, continuing to evolve with the company and as Dave said, seed planting for a strong future.","So with that, Elena, let\u2019s go to you and to the group for Q&A.","Elena Doom","We\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Good numbers obviously and thanks for not disappointing like some of the other large cap names have here. It makes our lives a little easier. But...","David Cote","Scott, I just wanted to note that we broke your paradigm about lackluster results today.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Well, you did but I still got another 24 that aren\u2019t so great either, so.","David Cote","As you might imagine, I read that last night and said, I can't wait to (inaudible) that one up tomorrow.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s all right.","David Cote","Did you (inaudible) your stuff?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s good. Somebody does. So look, the only thing I am going to pick on then just this kind of flattish free cash flow year-over-year and obviously you are going to spend some capital? But it begs the question of given just how weak the macro, the overall macro is coming in in the quarter, and your outlook which I don\u2019t think indicates much of a recovery from here. I mean why do you think you need to make substantial capital investments from here?","David Cote","Well, if we take a look at where the increase is coming from on the CapEx side, it's really for orders that we already have in PMT. And this is growth that\u2019s going to happen. We have got the new molecules, we have landed the new orders in UOP and we got to be able to ship the stuff. And it's as simple as that. And that\u2019s where the increase is primarily coming from. This is a good thing not a bad thing.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Sure. But isn\u2019t there a potential to have a decrease in some of the areas just given that you probably don\u2019t need to spend much capital at all for flattish type growth?","David Cote","I would say it's flattish for this year, that\u2019s the way we are going to think about it. But when we are making these kind of investments, we need to be looking further out than that. And I'd say we are pretty rigorous about how do we think about CapEx and where do we put the money. And any of the spending we are doing, I'd say is more than judicious when it comes to the returns that we are going to get from it. And as I said, the big increase is really coming out of PMT where we already have the orders in hand and we have to be able to support it.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Yeah. No, I totally understand that part of it. Okay. And then just as a follow up, when you think about the amount of cash you have in Europe and other areas around the world, is there any flexibility in how you fund the NARCO trust, and I also assume that some of this CapEx you are spending is going to be overseas money as well. The PMT, a fair amount of that is U.S., but anything that kind of gives you some flexibility on utilizing overseas cash instead of having to use your U.S. base?","David Anderson","Scott, this is Dave. You know we just continue to be smart in terms of our tax and treasury planning, in terms of managing our cash balances. Again the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year, all of our communications in terms of both cash and coverage ratios and everything else, assumed this outflow. So we just continue to be smart on that, continue to be very smart in terms, as I said, our tax and treasury planning.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Yeah, it's doesn\u2019t totally answer it. I guess my question is, can you use some of that European cash to fund NARCO or it has to be U.S. dollars?","David Anderson","Specifically those need to be U.S. dollars.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Okay. I figured as much. I just wanted to make sure. Okay, thanks and congrats guys. I will let you move on.","Operator","We will move next to Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","Question on aerospace aftermarket. Just in general, I know you are not planning for a stronger second half kind of pick up in the global economy but you are expecting an improvement on the commercial aftermarket. Is it -- you know as we transition, is it just easier comps or what kind of gives you the confidence when you are talking about what you are seeing for airline inventory levels.","David Cote","First, I want to state, we are not counting on much, Peter. We have tried to do that as a company and we lowered our sales sites even further in just about every business, saying we got to make sure that we are playing conservatively. So we are really not counting on much.","David Anderson","Yeah. I'll just maybe piggyback on Dave's comment, just add a little to it. We are looking at now up, low to mid-single digits in the commercial aftermarket for 2013. We think that\u2019s kind of a reasonable range given the first quarter performance and also just looking at the pattern of global flying hours and our patterns for sales for last year. So the comps as we said earlier and as you know, become much easier in the second half. So I think that is a good way to think and to plan going forward. You know some of the specifics on that, we continue to see very good R&O on both BGA as well as on the ATR side of it.","Elena Doom","And that\u2019s really two thirds of the make up in aftermarket.","David Anderson","Yeah, absolutely. That\u2019s a very good point, Elena. That\u2019s two thirds of the makeup of the revenues of the aerospace aftermarket. So we\u2019re continuing to see that being relatively good. And also our anticipation for the spare side of BGA is pretty good.","Elena Doom","Yeah. RMUs are continuing to be very strong.","David Anderson","And our RMUs are continuing to be very strong. So I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons why we think this low to mid-single digits. But that has tempered from where we started the year.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee","That\u2019s helpful. And just maybe speaking in general about the region, is it similar regionally, around the globe? It sounds like just in general from your report that Europe feels a little less bad and Asia is a little softer. Is that consistent also like what you\u2019re seeing?","David Anderson","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to the side of Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan.","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","I think Scott took care of all the brown nosing for today\u2019s call. So I\u2019ll skip that part.","David Cote","We can\u2019t get enough.","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","So just on the short cycle trends, it\u2019s a little bit all over the map here. Danaher talked about U.S being a little bit weaker. G was down 17% in Europe and it fell off a cliff in March. Maybe if you could just talk about your year, your highest frequency, economic indicators, the businesses you watch for that and maybe just talk about those trends, anything interesting that happened in March and into early April here.","David Cote","Sure. I would say when it came to March, things actually started to look a little tougher than they had before. Interestingly in the first couple of weeks of April things look a little bit better than they did before, but there\u2019s nothing here and there\u2019s a business we do watch called Basic Switches that we pay attention to something that portends to our future. But at the end of the day I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything that\u2019s caused any of use to say okay, the trend has begun in one direction or the other. There\u2019s just this order equivocation if you will where you just say okay, I still don\u2019t know enough one direction or the other to make a permanent or let\u2019s say more long lasting call. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to stay conservative. I\u2019d like to think that this is the trend, but after a couple of weeks of things being slightly better I\u2019m certainly not ready to declare.","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Can you just remind us also on these moves in commodity prices with oil going down and natural gas coming back up, how that impacts PMT and how you see that, is there any impact to the net out? And also I guess Advanced Materials as well, the price dynamic there, any risks?","David Cote","I don\u2019t see any risks from -- first of all gas pricing going up is a good phenomenon for a PMT because now you have more people willing to look for the stuff and pump it because that\u2019s, when it\u2019s only 253 box that\u2019s filled they just don\u2019t make sense. And when you get up to 450, well there\u2019s a lot of stuff that makes more sense than it did before and we\u2019ll encourage that dynamic. I like it. If we take a look at oil, whether it\u2019s $80 or $100, that is worth looking for more. So I don\u2019t see either of those trends being any hard movement around those numbers to be a problem for us.","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","So the pipeline, the quotation and opportunity pipeline ULT is still robust no matter what\u2019s going on here?","David Cote","No. it looks very good and I\u2019d say all the seed planting that we did there since we acquired it and all that additional Horizon\u2019s re-spending and becoming more global in our outreach is all stuff that just continues to play out very well for us.","David Anderson","As well as the strength of their position in the petrochemical industry has really reflected Dave in how they really outperformed peers in the first quarter.","Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","One last quick one. A lot of these chemical companies have been getting hit recently and I guess what is the risk that some of these projects get pushed even further? Are you seeing any of that?","David Cote","I can\u2019t say we\u2019re feeling anything like that. The stuff that we\u2019re looking at doing and we were investing really has nothing to do with commodity trends or anything like that. It\u2019s more the world needs energy. The world is going to continue to need energy. The world needs the new HFOs that we have invented. That\u2019s where the investments are going and that\u2019s where the backlog is built. And I have tough time seeing that really changing. It's always possible, but with any kind of minimal global economic growth, those trends continue.","Operator","We will move next to the site of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Just a few things. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you are seeing in Europe overall. I mean your comments there sound a little bit better, actually a lot better than most people that we are hearing. Can you put your finger on some particular share gain or something going on with end markets, your particular end markets?","David Cote","Let's say, if we take a look at the overall macros, we are not saying things are better there. And based on how things are going, we would still forecast and plan for 0% GDP growth over the next three years. It's just the way we are going to continue to think about and plan for it because there is nothing to indicate that they are ever going to have just a bang up quarter or year. So we are going to keep thinking about it that way. Part of what I think we are seeing, is last year we took -- orders trends were really pretty negative in Europe. We were down pretty much double-digit all year along. It's just one of those things that we had to manage. We got our cost structure in line, which helped. But then on the orders side there is a bit of a rebound that you get from the (inaudible) just being down so much and managing your way through that.","So I am not ready to declare victory on anything. And I would say in terms of products, ACS did much better in Europe overall. But again, I think some of that is driven by just being down so much last year and you get some of the, we can call it a dead cat bounce, I think it's better than that. But at the end of the day, it's not an indicator that Europe is turning around, in my view.","David Anderson","I think, Jeff, just to add quickly what Dave said is, it really, it continues to be an inconsistent orders pattern. Overall, slight negative organically that we have in terms of growth in the first quarter and Europe is really again [attributed] just to the balance of the portfolio.","Elena Doom","Both long and short....","David Anderson","Long and short cycle, we see that balance working. And so it's not, as we have sort of, the theme if anything we are really striking here again today is, we are not counting on any kind of improvement. And in fact what we are really counting on is just the continued opportunity to improve our cost structure, our productivity. That\u2019s some of the repositioning that we have funded here in the first quarter.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah, actually on that point, I mean the restructuring size isn\u2019t huge but very attractive payback kind of surprises me a little bit, given how far along ostensibly you guys are on restructuring. How are you finding such big payback projects and is there more of that that may happen over the course of '13.","David Cote","Well, I would go back to the process initiatives that we always talk about. The Velocity Product Development, the Honeywell Operating System, Functional Transformation. The evolution of that is going to continue for a long time to come. And as long as we continue to progress on that path, I would like to think there are always going to be high returns projects that are going to come available to us. And I don\u2019t see that opportunity declining in the future. There is going to be good payback projects for us for a long time to come.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Right. And then just maybe one final one and I will pass it on. The flip side of Scott's concern about the weak economy and spending CapEx, I mean maybe there is some vulnerable deal targets out there, people getting a little bit jumpier about their station in life. Are you seeing any pickup in your M&A pipeline, just the funnel itself or the likelihood that things maybe happen more actively over the course of the next six to 12 months?","David Cote","Well, it's always tough to predict Jeff. As we said before, we always maintain just a very big active pipeline. We conduct reviews with the businesses about every six weeks where we go through, what are the possibilities and how are things looking and what could be new or different. I can't say that we have noticed any big change in any of that. But again, we are not looking for any big changes. We have tried to really make this a very methodical un-cyclical process.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to the site of Steve Winoker of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","I\u2019ve got to tell you, after Steve's reaction to Scott's comment, I\u2019ve just got to say I\u2019m in the camp of nice quarter and there should be a few apples on your desk in Morristown.","David Cote","I look forward to it.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Now just a couple of things. First, the other side of the prior question on input costs or on the commodities is, what was the specific input cost impact on Advanced Materials this quarter that is a benefit from that? Was it broader also across the portfolio?","Elena Doom","Steve, if you don\u2019t mind the net price growth brand for Advanced Materials was actually slightly favorable. However, where you\u2019re really seeing the impact on rise is within resins and chemicals with increased prices on benzene and propylene specifically. But the remainder of Advanced Materials was a slightly favorable benefit in the quarter.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","And you would expect that to continue?","David Cote","Who knows? Who can predict the commodities cost? I have got to overall to bolster Elena's point, there tends to be more of a capital question than anything else because the rest of the business doesn\u2019t really get affected much by that.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","All right. But it\u2019s in your plan? You\u2019re planning for that continuity?","David Cote","We always plan conservatively, I can promise you that. Whether it\u2019s sales, cost price spreads, we try to be conservative because you just never know.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Just a higher level again, so here we have another quarter with limited overall volume growth, margins are progressing forward, you\u2019re getting at that with the prior question as well, but as we start, again, thinking about longer term and assuming that you do not get or if your topline continues to be weak, and in fact we don't get the pickup and all of that, and you think about how much margin or how long you can sustain the cost and efficiency improvements, at least just thinking about the next few quarters, how are you currently thinking about that?","David Cote","I'm sorry, Steve. How are we thinking about what exactly?","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","How much margin expansion you get in the absence of any volume growth?","David Cote","Well, as you know we're believers that margin expansion is a fundamental based on how good your processes are and your process improvement. This is where I'm going to come back again, the Honeywell operating system, velocity product development, functional transformation and our overall margin rate versus some of our peers. When you look at it that way, you say, okay, there's still lot of upside here. I prefer not to do it this way for the next five years. I'd like to think that there's some economic growth, sales growth in there at some point, but at the end of the day, we\u2019ve still got a lot of room to progress just becoming more efficient every year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","But at least not going negative, right? You can at least maintain it?","David Cote","Well, I don't think going negative.","David Anderson","Steve, you can see that in our forward guidance. You can see it in our 2013 numbers, what we have as we\u2019ve communicated at Investor Day for 2014. And again as Dave said, that's against the backdrop of the \u2013 modest to low revenue growth, depending upon the business. You're going to see some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. For example we had just very, very terrific as expected UOP margin contribution in PMT this quarter. PMT, as I indicated in my comments earlier is going to benefit from again revenue growth from UOP in the second quarter, but it's not going to have the same favorable mix that it had in the second quarter of 2012 where we had very strong licensing revenues and obviously very high -- and conversion. We also have Intermec that's going to happen. It's going to dilute the margins. So there's things that influence it, but the overall general trend will continue to be positive.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Great. Just finally, a little bit more color about how Defense & Space is currently thinking about sequestration playing out and the impact on their model versus where they've been over the last nine months?","David Cote","The smart call is to just assume that it continues and that's the way we're going to keep thinking about it. This is not a time to be bullish. We are better off staying conservative and if they change the spend profile in defense, great. If they don\u2019t, we are fully prepared.","David Anderson","And we have added additional sequestration impact in our full year revenue forecast. That\u2019s one of the key reasons, as we said on a full year basis we were bringing our total revenues down a little bit, partly as a result of now reflecting that full sequestration.","Operator","And we move next to the site of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","A couple of quick items, Dave. First, when you talked about HPS large projects ramp down, could you kind of characterize the geography and what you are doing to see maybe, talk about stabilization of the business or how the patterns sort of flow as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months?","David Cote","Howard, I would say, one of the things that we are doing in process solutions and that\u2019s important, is the guys are doing a very good job of going after the installs that we won. So think of it as the same sort of thing that we talked about in aerospace of being selective about the platforms that you decide to go for. Our process solutions guys have been doing the same thing and as a result of that, we are seeing much better margin rates in the backlog then what we saw before.","As we look around the world, I would say it's pretty well mixed in terms of where you see the big projects. But in general, it's got more of a focus on high growth regions, if you will, and what you are going to see in developed markets.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then just as a follow up. On new products, you talk about a lot of things playing about the way you want. Are there one of two things you would like to call out where as you have developed new products across the portfolio, where things are playing our maybe a little bit better and they can accelerate as you look forward?","David Cote","Well, I could tell you some of the stuff that I am pretty pumped about. We just went to the ISC West show for security and unveiled three or four really, pretty cool now products for both on the video side and the overall integrated systems side. And if any of you were in Times Square yesterday and happened to look up at the Reuters board, you would have seen an earned media, in other words we didn\u2019t pay a thing for it consistent with our, kind of tight watch spending. But you saw our new thermostat, our new Wi-Fi thermostat, put you there by PR Newswire as being the greatest thing since slice spread. They might not have put it that way but that was certainly the message. So, yeah, I am pretty excited about all that stuff. ACS has some really great new products already out there and as you might imagine, a lot more good stuff to come.","Operator","We will move next to the site of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Just on the point of sequestration. Do we think, assuming that nothing changes, now this down 5% is about the new norm for that business, which obviously can be managed, but is that run rate or is this something about the second quarter that makes that a little bit worse?","David Anderson","I think it's just really timing in large parts, John, of some of the projects phase outs, wind downs. We had a little more favorability in D&S in the first quarter and we will have a little less favorability, a little more decline in the second quarter. So it's really just timing there. And then the other thing as we indicated is just the continued progress and performance that that businesses leadership is making in offsetting U.S. DoD budget declines, just in terms of pursuing opportunities elsewhere. So that\u2019s coming through the numbers as well. So basically, I would say.....","David Cote","Yeah, particularly international.","David Anderson","Exactly. But for the full year it's a modest tweak down from roughly 3% previously guided down for D&S to now more like 4% down.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And does that imply that the U.S. piece of the defense and space is down more but you are making it up internationally, is that part of the mix or?","David Anderson","Yeah.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. So that makes sense. What about turbo? This is prospectively the worst European auto build quarter. What is the \u2013 what do you think the runway is for turbo and particularly on a growth rate basis given the easier compares, as you exit the year because you\u2019ve got all these new platform wins. That business should be ramping up I would think pretty nicely heading into the second half, no?","David Cote","I would say there's that opportunity, but I'm certainly not going to predict what the Euro auto industry build is going to be. We're going to stay conservative even with what we get some kind of EDI global insight forecast. And I certainly hope what you're saying is correct and we do believe that there is that strong possibility. But we're going to continue to be careful.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Well, let me ask it this way. Does new platform wins in Turbo based on what you've been able to achieve over the past couple of years, does that materially impact growth rate this year? Or is it more of a tailwind into next year?","David Cote","Both. We certainly see the impact this year. We saw it even this quarter where the Euro auto industry was down about 10% and we were down about 4%, largely because of the impact of new launches. That's why with any kind of just market stabilization, never mind growth, we end up in a really great place.","Elena Doom","I would add that the new launches in the second half are also expected to accelerate over the levels that we saw in the first quarter and what we'll see in the second quarter.","David Anderson","As we indicated, I think we actually have a shot and that's going to work here, actually having a volume increase in Turbo in the second quarter at the high end of our range and launches together with some other favorable macros, commercial vehicle, better comps, all of those should support the improved performance, John, over the course of 2013.","Elena Doom","And some modest low-single digit growth in the second half.","David Anderson","Yeah.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Was this contingent on some a framework of European auto build? I can't remember if you said that this is based on European auto build this year doing X?","Elena Doom","Yeah. We're assuming that light vehicle production is down low to mid-single digits for the year in Europe.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And then just lastly, Dave Anderson, I thought we historically have been talking about several hundred million of NARCO Trust funding. Why is that -- how have you been able to possibly accomplish this in such a lower rate? Is that because you had prefunded it before and it really still is that number? Or maybe a little more color on the NARCO and why now and, it seems like you've done a better job of being able to fund this. Just what happened here?","David Anderson","Well, I think what we're seeing now is we're seeing a calendarization if you will, the phasing of the anticipated claims payment for those that have not been processed and executed since the beginning of the stay that goes back to 2002. So I think number one, we have a better read on what the timing of that could be, John that claims processing through the trust. And I think number two, what we're showing here is a little precise numbers given the insurance recoveries and also tax affecting those cash outflows. So it's a combination of those and then something that's consistent obviously is the future period look in terms of the enforcement of the caps 2015 and beyond, but again including and what've shared with you today, the after insurance recovery and after-tax impacts to Honeywell. So I think it's really just those, a combination of those updates and refinements.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","I\u2019m sorry, the reason this is costing so much less today is why, because of actuarial precision or something?","David Anderson","No. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s costing less. I think what we\u2019re doing is we have the payments for claims that if you will catch up, the historic claims processing spread over two years, 2013 and 2014 as well as 2013 includes trust formation funding, trust formation spending, that\u2019s about $45 million after tax. We have those now calculated we think more accurately or a little more precisely is probably the best way of saying it. It\u2019s still very much estimates in terms of how this is going to play out and we\u2019re showing all those numbers to you on an after insurance recovery after-tax basis. What you may be recalling is some communications that we\u2019ve made on pretax dollars and some of those communications probably also did not factor in some of the direct insurance recoveries. So what we\u2019ve done is sharpened the pencil and our communication today, to show what really the net impact and our best judgment of the timing of those outflows.","Elena Doom","Leo, we have time for just one more question.","Operator","We will move next to Deane Dray, Citi Research. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - Citi","Thank you, good morning everyone.","David Cote","Yeah, I hope you like the amount of cabbage this quarter.","Deane Dray - Citi","You know I think you have done some good harvesting there. So I can also say I was at that ISC West Trade Show in Las Vegas and did see a number of those new products. Especially the integrated security systems that combine security, HVAC controls and energy savings. And there were a number of blue ribbons that you have all won as best in show. So congratulations on that.","David Cote","Thanks. We are pretty -- ACS has a lot, just a great new product pipeline on all the stuff that you saw. Pretty excited about where that\u2019s going to go.","Deane Dray - Citi","And the question I had is on, in ACS, on the process side. The comments about the backlog converting at higher margins. I mean that\u2019s all good news but hopefully you could break out, how much of this is the result of your better pricing going into backlog? Is there a mix benefit and how might there be some new products in there as well?","David Cote","Well, I think you touched on all the items, I would also, I guess maybe to bounce through the first part of that, it's just better discipline in how we price, how we understand what our cost is going to be and how do we manage that. And what do we decide to go after. But in addition, they have done a great job on new products and moving up the value chain into the kind of simulation and operator training type products that others can't really do. And that always gives you just a better margin overall. Dave, I don\u2019t know if there is anything you want to add to that?","David Anderson","Yeah. No, I think that\u2019s exactly right.","Deane Dray - Citi","So just lastly on that is, where are we in that cycle? Is the push back I here from some investors as, hey, this is the peak and you are going to see diminished spending in these areas. But it just doesn\u2019t seem like that would be the case with the amount of retrofits and upgrades. But just can you comment on where we are on that cycle?","David Cote","Yeah, I guess I have a tough time seeing that myself. If we remember, about these sales go into the petrochemical and oil and gas side. And we have a good insight to that from just what's going on in UOP, and that looks pretty robust. And for the same reason we said before, the world needs energy and there was a long period of time where there was disinvestment. We are starting to see that churn within the refining industry that while it only grows 2%, there is a big shift that\u2019s going on and high growth regions are building more capability. And, well, I just have a tough time seeing that being a declining industry.","Elena Doom","All right. I would like to hand it over to Dave Cote for any final comments.","David Cote","Thanks, Elena. We are obviously pleased with our performance in the quarter and we are able to raise our margin rates substantially even on low sales growth. And for me anyway, it's exciting to think about what we could do if we just got some sales growth. It's exciting to think about the possibilities. We will continue to go to plan on a slow macro environment really because there is no percentage in planning otherwise. And I think it's important to think about this performance as a result not just of conservative planning, which we talk about a lot and we do every year, but it's also that relentless seed planting that we do. Whether it's products, technologies, process, geographies, we want to do a great job not just with this quarter but this quarter next year, three years from now, ten years from now. And as the planning continues and it's just a part of who we are, and I think that\u2019s why you can continue to expect us outperform in the future. So thank you for listening and I hope you are pleased as we are. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Michael. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote, Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of this presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter and share with you our guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2015. Finally as always we'll leave time for your questions at the end.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth to kick off 2015 driven by our diverse portfolio and effective execution what continues to be a challenging macro environment.","Our earnings per share of $1.41 increased 10% year-over-year coming in at the high end of our guidance range. The macro environment in the first quarter wasn't easy with headwinds from extreme weather, port shutdowns, decline in oil and gas investments and a strengthening US dollar.","Sales in the quarter of $9.2 billion, while up to 2% on a core organic basis were down 5% reported. Our performance was driven by decent organic growth and strong sales conversion with segment margins expanding 220 basis points to 18.7%.","And as you'll hear from Tom a bit later, a large portion of the margin expansion came from improving gross margins, something a bit different than the past. It results from our focus on HOS both direction and indirect material and new products.","Our key process initiatives are driving meaningful results throughout the portfolio. 140 basis points of the segment margin rate improvement was driven by commercial excellence and productivity. The rest of the improvement comes from smart decisions we've made about the portfolio.","An important enabler of the productivity continues to be the savings we're seeing from previously funded restructuring actions. We're being proactive about keeping that pipeline full which we think is critical to supporting our continued margin expansion in 2016 and beyond.","However, while managing our costs is important, we're also focused on supporting sales growth by investing in capacity expansion, new products and technologies, and resources in high growth regions.","As a result of that strong first quarter performance and our confidence in the remainder of the year, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance by a nickel to a new range of $6 to $6.15 or up 8% to 11% versus the prior year.","As we've been saying since December, we want to ensure we're remaining balanced in our planning for 2015 while continuing our seed planting investments for the future. In the quarter we proactively funded about $40 million of restructuring, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects, and we've continued our transactional and translational hedging into 2016.","The euro is our biggest exposure. In 2015 we've hedged approximately 85% of our euro P&L exposure in an average rate of about $1.24. For 2016 we have again hedged approximately 85% of our euro P&L exposure at a plan rate of $1.10.","In the current environment we believe the certainty this provides is prudent and generates the time needed to offset the impact in future years. We also continue seed planting for exciting new HUE based products, technologies and process improvements that will help us continue to win in the marketplace.","On HOS Gold we are continuing to invest across our gold enterprises to create units that grow faster and are more profitable than our competitors. We want to marry big company cost efficiency, which is real if it\u2019s done correctly and technical and functional excellence with small company speed and customer responsiveness accomplishing two seemingly conflicting things at the same time. Each HOS gold unit is identifying breakthrough strategies and moves into smart new areas and adjacencies.","In early May we'll be kicking off our 2015 technology symposium, a forum that brings together approximately 400 Honeywell technology, marketing and management representatives from all of the businesses.","This annual event which started about 10 years ago provides opportunities for ongoing collaboration and idea generation, and is focused on driving breakthrough innovations supported by differentiated processes and technologies, all of which helps enhance our great positions in good industries.","Process solutions open the Honeywell industrial cyber security lab in Duluth Georgia to advance development and testing of new technologies and software to defend industrial facilities and operations like refineries and manufacturing plants from cyber attacks.","We also recently inaugurated three new research and development labs at the Honeywell center of excellence in Brno, Czech Republic and plan to open another five labs within a months as part of a $10 million investment in the region to support both aerospace and ACS.","In March we closed the acquisition of Datamax-O\u2019Neil, a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers. Datamax-O\u2019Neil portfolio of solutions expand Honeywell's ability to deliver enhance work flow performance and the team is very excited about this acquisition which builds on existing printing capabilities acquired with Intermec.","Scanning and mobility continues to execute very well, delivering another quarter of double-digit core organic sales growth in the first quarter driven primarily by volume from key wins, most recently the US Postal Service deal signed last year.","We also continue to be excited about the flooring products portfolio where we saw particular strength, up double-digits on a core organic basis driven by the ramp up of our Solstice low global warming suite of products.","We've seen increasing demand for these products, where we now have a lifetime value of signed agreements of about $2.6 billion and another $800 million under negotiation. As we look ahead, we're cautious overall on the macro environment like I've been for five years. While we continue to expect that the benefit of lower oil prices will eventually play through in the US and in oil importing nations, this is really yet to be seen.","There was weakness in January across the portfolio that we weren't able to fully recover from, but we did see good signs of improvement as the quarter progressed. GDP growth rates globally are weaker than most had expected for the first quarter.","Now, we think weather had some impact early in the quarter in the US, but the slowdown was not unique to the US. With all that said, the majority of our businesses exited the quarter with momentum following more robust core organic growth rates in both February and March.","Nevertheless, we're going to continue to plan conservatively to navigate the current headwinds, including oil and gas and as always we're not counting on a pickup in the global economy. We are well positioned to continue performing in this environment.","Our portfolio is aligned to favorable macro trends and provides significant runway to grow. We have great positions in good industries. We're investing to grow faster than the markets we serve, and we'll stay the course on seed planting and continuous improvement initiatives.","We're going to stay flexible and follow the play book you've come to expect from us, so that we can deliver on this year, next year, and beyond.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Dave. And good morning. I'm now on slide 4 which shows the first quarter results, sales of $9.2 billion, were up 2% on a core organic basis, but decreased 5% on a reported basis.","The absence of friction materials which you'll recall was still in the portfolio for the first half of 2014, further strengthening of the US dollar and raw materials pricing in resins and chemicals were headwinds driving the negative reported growth this quarter.","However, considering the slow start that we got off to in January, we were actually 8% down in January versus 2014 on a core organic basis. So even given that slow start, we feel pretty good about the Q1 core organic growth.","Shipment timing in aerospace, order delays and PMT and unplanned plant outages in resins and chemicals prevented us from fully meeting our sales expectations, but as you'll see later we expect the growth rate to improve as the year progresses.","An important note, the 2% core organic sales growth excludes FX, M&A and now the raw material pricing impact in resins and chemicals. Selling prices in resins and chemicals include an element of raw material pass through, most notably benzene, which is highly correlated to the price of oil. While the pricing model protects profit dollars, sales can be volatile, so we've modified the definition here to provide further insight into the underlying volume growth of our businesses.","Segment profit increased 8% with segment margin expanding 220 basis points. The most impressive part about the segment margin performance is that most of the improvement came through gross margin rates.","HOS Gold is working across Honeywell, from our engineering labs to our factories and supply chains, to our selling and marketing organizations and even to our back office. Our deployment of Honeywell user experience in product development is yielding better products that our customers are willing to pay for.","Our supply chains are becoming even more lean and there is a strong collaboration between our engineers, sourcing organization and supply chain to drive down our material costs. Our focus on commercial excellence is yielding more focused sales teams and smarter pricing decisions.","Operating costs are in check with SG&A also contributing to the segment margin rate improvement. Meanwhile, we continue to devote significant resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing ones.","As we said in March, HOS Gold is a game changer and will be a differentiator for us as it was in this first quarter. We'll provide some additional color on the Q1 margin expansion in a moment.","The items below segment profit came in as we expected. We had an increased year-over-year and pension income which was completely offset by restructuring of approximately $40 million. Note, in the prior period operating margin included the restructuring and other charges from the BE Arrow [ph] gain deployment, but excluded the gain itself. So operating margins expanded 340 basis points in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the 220 basis points expansion in segment margin.","Earnings per share was up \u2013 earnings per share was $1.41, up 10% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. We once again achieved double-digits earnings growth driven largely by increases in segment profit. Year-over-year share count was flat, so a good start on the P&L despite the environment.","Finally, free cash flow in the quarter of 256 million came in down $240 million from 2014, driven primarily by timing, including the payment of the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives, higher cash taxes, and higher working capital requirements, particularly in aerospace.","The first quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective and we remain on track to our full year guidance of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter at approximately $1.3 billion negative net cash position, and as we highlighted in March, we expect to be in a positive net cash position approximating $1 billion to $2 billion by year end assuming no significant M&A. Overall we generated strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.","I'm now on slide 5. I talked previously about the nature of our 220 basis point segment margin improvement. This slide provides some additional color on the specific drivers of that improvement.","The first category is the core organic or operational drivers which generate 140 of the 220 basis point improvement. We're often asked to quantify the impact of HOS Gold. This first category is highly correlated to it. We can't always commit to triple digit margin expansion from HOS Gold, but you can see that the components touch all critical facets of our businesses.","We're benefiting from commercial excellence, most prominently in aerospace, as well as significant productivity improvement and volume leverage across the portfolio. New product introductions and further penetration in high growth regions, particularly at ACS, are also part of it.","We're also seeing savings from previously funded restructuring actions. Additionally as we indicated, we are able to proactively fund another $40 million of restructuring in the first quarter, improve our overall cost position, and drive further margin expansion going forward.","The remaining three categories on this slide individually look pedestrian, but collectively reflect the benefits that our shareholders are realizing from the strategic decisions we have made and executed on.","First, you can see the favorable margin impact from the friction materials divestiture, which we closed in July of 2014. This is a permanent improvement in our margin rate from exiting a business that did not meet our portfolio standards.","You can expect to see additional year-over-year favorability in the second quarter from this divestiture and we are always assessing our portfolio to ensure all of our businesses continue to constitute great positions in good industries.","Second, our hedging approach for foreign currency provided a big benefit. As you know, we made a decision last summer to expand our hedging approach from protecting our hundreds of individual P&Ls from foreign currency exposure, that is transactional exposure to one now where we are protecting the consolidated Honeywell enterprise, so that's transactional, plus translational exposure. The hedge strategy is in place to protect our operating results, but not necessarily at top line, thus the margin lift.","Additionally, our merging markets footprint in our engineering organization, supply chain and back office also protect us from the strengthening US dollar. These strategies will be worth $0.12 to $0.13 to our shareholders in 2015 and help drive the margin improvement you see here.","Third, in resins and chemicals, we have developed the lowest cost operating position in the world. A competitive position which allows us to run our plants at full capacity. Material costs are passed through to customers, so when raw materials \u2013when raw [ph] market conditions are volatile like we're experiencing today, margin rates can be impacted, in this case favorably. When the material pass through and therefore sales is reduced, but margin remains the same. Without that low cost position our ability to compete for profitable business would be impaired as would the margin rates.","Moving to slide 6 and the aerospace results, you can see here on the comparative sales stack bars, that we were highlighting the impacts of inorganic drivers. Namely for aerospace, foreign exchange headwinds and M&A, that is the friction materials divesture. We filed a similar convention on the subsequent pages for both ACS and PMT.","Sales for the first quarter were up 1% on an organic basis, but down 6% reported, driven by the friction materials divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movement, mostly in turbo.","Segment margin was up 250 basis points driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impacts from the friction divesture and foreign exchange. So overall great work by the aerospace team to drive robust margin expansion.","From a sales perspective, commercial OE was up 1% on an organic basis. In air transport and regional we saw a continued benefit from higher OE build rates at Boeing, airbus and Embraer, partially offset by intentionally slower shipments to certain emerging market customers in order to manage temporary funding delays.","In business general and aviation, there were lower than expected deliveries on certain platforms that are in transition, engine demand is robust, so we expect to see a pickup in growth in BGA in the second quarter.","Commercial aircraft sales were up 1% on a core organic basis driven by strong growth in repair and overhaul activities, but partially offset by lower spare sales, particularly in China and Russia.","We believe that this year represents a normal run rate for spare sales in China after a significant restocking by our airlines customers in 2014. Also similar to the OE side, we intentionally slowed spare shipments to certain emerging market customers as a risk management matter. Overall we anticipate continued growth in R&O and improvement in spares in the second quarter and into the second half.","Defense and space sales were down 1% on a core organic basis. We had lower deliveries in the US due to timing, but still expect the core organic sales will be up for defense and space on balance for the rest of the year. Defense and space backlog increased high single digit year-over-year.","We anticipate some ongoing softness in the US, but we're very encouraged by the continued double-digit growth of our international defense business, which continues to be a tailwind in defense and space.","Finally, transportation system sales increased 5% on a core organic basis due to strong volume growth in light vehicle gas applications where we continue to see increased global penetration.","The success we have seen in TS continued in this quarter, and we expect similar growth throughout 2015. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 23%, reflecting both the friction materials divestiture and foreign currency headwinds.","So let's turn to ACS results on slide 7. ACS sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, excluding an approximate 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Across the ACS portfolio we saw weakness in January, as we mentioned at our Investor Day in March, followed by steady core organic growth in February and March. All of the ACS businesses are exiting the quarter with good momentum giving us confidence going into the second quarter.","ESS sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter driven by continued strength in our scanning and mobility, fire safety, and security businesses. Scanning and mobility delivered another quarter of double-digit core organic sales growth following the double-digit increase for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. The business continues to perform well driven by volume from recent program wins such as the US Postal Service program that Dave mentioned.","In addition, we continue to realize integration benefits from Intermec in the combination of the two businesses. As for the rest of ESS, growth continues to be driven by new product introductions and further penetration in high growth regions. In particular, China and India each were up close to 15% in the first quarter with strength across most of the ESS portfolio, and we expect this to continue into the second quarter.","Building solutions and distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the first quarter with continued strength in America's fire and security distribution businesses and growth in building solutions.","Within building solutions, we continue to see good growth in our higher margin service business and as was the case with ESS, sales in BSD improved in February, March following a slow start in January. ACS margins expanded 180 basis points in the quarter to 15.8%. The business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volumes and significant productivity improvements net of inflation.","While the business has been able to control costs and optimize internal processes, our investments for growth, particularly in new product development and in high growth regions continue as we have highlighted previously.","In addition, we continue to realize incremental synergy benefits from the combination of Intermec with scanning mobility. We expect the margin expansion to continue, particularly as the team builds on a connected ACS initiative, which Alex talked about at our Investor Day in March.","I'm now on slide 8, and before I review the PMT results, I'd like to provide an update on our oil and gas related businesses similar to what we shared in January. Our upstream portfolio which resides entirely in our process solutions business comprises controls, solutions and remote operations for deepwater offshore facilities.","As we've said, this upstream exploration and production part of the value chain is a small portion of PMT and roughly 1% of Honeywell's sales. And here, despite a significant scale back in future capital spending plans by international oil companies and national oil companies, which have caused a good deal of volatility in our market, our backlogs have held up, and there have been no cancellations to date.","In fact, we saw a double-digit increase in volume of large order project wins in our projects and automation solutions business in process solutions in the first quarter, with approximately one third of that increase residing in our upstream segment.","But discretionary spend both CapEx and OpEx is being cut across the board in this segment, and we felt the impact of these actions at HPS in particular. We are seeing softness in our short cycle field instrumentation business tied to both project delay, as well as reductions to maintenance, repairs and operations budgets.","Our orders in the second quarter will be challenged as a result, but we'll continue to leverage our strong cost productivity actions to offset any downturn in 2015. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that 45% of HPS is not tied to oil and gas, which further highlights our relatively low exposure to the volatility upstream.","Moving to midstream, roughly a third of the UOP business, so the gas processing piece and about a quarter of the HPS business, which comprises gas metering and transfer, safety and security and terminals, is considered midstream. So think of oil and gas recovery, upgrading, treating pipelines and storage.","We saw tremendous growth in our gas processing sales in the first quarter, particularly in UOP Russell, which was up double-digits on a core organic basis. Our midstream business overall has been impacted by the steep reduction in the US gas and oil rig count, and we did see one cancellation of approximately $35 million in our gas processing business in the US in this quarter.","Orders are expected to continue to be challenged across our midstream business, including in HPS where customers are delaying spending decisions and cutting discretionary spend and also delaying conversion of orders and backlog.","However, we also anticipate that international gas processing projects for modular equipment and additional service sales to US customers will help to mitigate the softness in the US in 2015 and 2016.","Finally, our downstream segment primarily includes petrochemical and refining, which comprises about two thirds of UOP, and that's mostly process technologies, equipment and catalysts and approximately 20% of HPS, which is process controls, field instruments, services and optimization. Here we're experiencing delays and reductions in countries that are net oil producers, like Russia, as refining and petrochemical project decisions are deferred.","A notable exception is the Middle East where we \u2013 we've seen new wins and an active pipeline of new bids, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia and we're encouraged by the expected growth in HPS and UOP in the region.","Also two thirds of the aforementioned double-digit increase in orders growth in the projects and automations solutions business and HPS is in this down stream refining sector. As the infrastructure investments continue to ramp in the Middle East, we anticipate continued positive growth in 2015 and in 2016.","In the oil importing countries, mainly China and India, the benefit of the lower cost oil imports is mostly being absorbed by the national government, and is not currently being invested in energy projects.","However, we do see continued momentum in the catalyst first load and reload activity for methanol to olefin and Oleflex licenses in China and a similar positive level of activity in India, particularly in our short cycle businesses in HPS.","We're continuing to see existing projects progress and none have been abandoned. However, the initiation of new projects has been extremely slow. Overall, however, we continue to believe that in the mid to long-term, the impact further downstream will be neutral to in some cases positive despite the delays we have seen thus far.","Sales and parts of our resins and chemicals business continue to be negatively impacted by the market based pricing, whereby selling prices are closely tied to the market price of raw materials, most notably benzene which is highly correlated to the price of oil, as we've discussed since December, while lower raw material cost continue to be a headwind to the top line, the pricing model protects profit dollars even on those lower sales. We now expect this will approximate a $400 million headwind to our reported sales in 2015.","In ACS, a small portion of our industrial safety businesses, the portable gas detection and safety products businesses participate in oil and gas related end markets. We have seen minor impacts due to the recent work force reductions, mainly in the upstream segment.","While demand for our gas detection and safety products has slowed, we continue to expect lower oil prices to eventually create demand side favorability across the remainder of the ACS portfolio.","In terms of operating expenses, we are seeing favorable cost trends across the portfolio, including in our freight, utilities and other supply chain costs, as well as in our other indirect spend. We expect this will continue to be a nice tailwind for us throughout 2015 and continue to look for ways to drive further productivity and cost savings across the portfolio.","In terms of the second derivative impacts, we highlighted in December that we anticipate that the emerging airline profitability from lower oil prices could drive further activity with that customer segment.","In addition, the lower prices at the pump, improvements in employment and overall positive consumer sentiment have driven greater demand for autos where we are benefiting from increased demand for turbocharger technologies. The impact to our short cycle business on the whole thus far has been neutral, but we expect an increase in demand across the portfolio as lower oil prices persist.","On balance, the headwinds we are seeing in our oil and gas business will continue to present challenge in the near to mid term and we continue to plan conservatively to mitigate the impacts in this area.","We do expect to eventually see some positive impacts from lower oil prices, which will benefit our short cycle businesses, particularly in ACS as the benefit makes its way further downstream to consumers. We are also encouraged by the benefit to our own cost structure which will continue to provide a nice tailwind in 2015 and 2016.","I am moving to slide 9 for PMT first quarter results. PMT sales in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 3% on a core organic basis and down 5% on a reported basis. The reported decline was driven by foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of lower oil prices on resins and chemicals, as we have spoken about before.","Starting with the UOP, sales were up 9% on a core organic basis driven primarily by higher gas processing sales, particularly at UOP Russell. As a reminder, UOP grew 9% on a core organic basis in the first quarter of 2014 as well. So exceptional growth even against a difficult year-over-year comp.","Orders were roughly flat in the quarter with strong growth in the product technologies and equipment business, offsetting declines in gas processing which are mostly timing related. As you know, we are in the midst of adding UOP capacity, particularly on the catalyst side which will help the business better service its backlog, which continues to hold firm.","In process solutions, sales were below our expectations. Core organic sales down 3% and reported sales down 11%. Obviously foreign exchange headwinds impacted our reported sales.","Orders overall were slightly down in the quarter as we experienced some order delays, particularly in March as we approach the quarter end. While we're not seeing order cancellations in HPS, some customers are delaying project startups, and in some cases future capital spending decisions.","Still on balance, our projects business had a strong orders quarter, up strong double-digits, primarily driven by the Middle East where we see infrastructure investments continuing. Discretionary spend is under pressure, which primarily impacted our orders and sales growth in our field products business.","Our service backlog is holding up well with low single digit sales growth, a reflection of our comprehensive offerings to our strong install base. Process solutions backlog increased high single digit year-over-year, which gives us confidence that the sales growth rates will eventually improve.","Advanced material sales were up 2% on a core organic basis and decreased 12% reported, again primarily driven by foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of lower oil prices on resin and chemicals.","In addition, we had unplanned outages in our resins and chemicals plants that had a negative impact on production volumes, and segment margin in the quarter. The rest of the advanced material saw positive core organic growth in the quarter, particularly in flooring products, which again grew double-digit as demand continues for Solstice products continues to grow.","PMT margins were up 230 basis points to 21.5%, which exceeded our guidance, driven by commercial excellence, significant productivity actions net of inflation and higher UOP and flooring products volumes as we've discussed.","This was partially offset by the resins and chemicals unplanned plant outages we highlighted and continued investments for growth across PMT. So in summary, despite less sales growth than expected the business continues to deliver on results. Also PMT is aggressively pursuing cost reduction opportunities in anticipation of potential further top line pressure.","I'm now on slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For total Honeywell we are expecting sales of $9.6 billion to $9.8 billion, up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis, but down 4% to 6% reported. We think we're being prudent in our planning approach given the slow start for the top line we saw in the first quarter.","Segment margins are expected to be up approximately 130 to 150 basis points versus 2014. We expect our segment margin rate to again benefit from the factors that drove the significant first quarter margin expansion, especially operational excellence and execution.","We do anticipate higher engineering sales and marketing investments in the second quarter, as well as a less favorable sales mix and lower margin rate benefit from the friction materials, foreign currency and resins and chemicals raw materials pricing drivers I explained earlier.","Given these factors and our conservative planning, the segment margin expansion may not be as robust as Q1, but will still be well into the triple digit range. With that said, second quarter EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51, up 7% to 10% versus 2014 on a basis normalized for tax at 26.5% in both years.","Moving into businesses, aerospace sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis or down 5% to 7% on a reported basis, reflecting the year-over-year absence of friction material sales, as well as anticipated foreign currency headwinds in the quarter.","In commercial OE, we expect core organic sales will be up low single digit, driven primarily by continued healthy demand in mid to large cabin business aircraft where we have significant new content, partially offset by the timing of ATR OE build rates.","In commercial after market we expect core organic sales to be up low to mid single digit, with continued repair and overhaul and ATR spares growth, partially offset by slower BGA spares growth.","Defense and space sales are expected to be approximately flat on a core organic basis, driven by continued strengths in the international business, offset by a decline in the US as we've highlighted.","In transportation systems, sales are expected to be up mid single digits on a core organic basis, but down significantly on a reported basis. Similar to the first quarter, the growth in TS on a core organic basis is primarily driven by new launches and strong light vehicle gas turbo volume globally.","As for aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 140 to 160 basis points in the second quarter driven by commercial excellence, significant productivity improvements across the portfolio, and favorable impacts of the friction materials divestiture.","ACS sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% on a core organic basis or down 1% to 3% on a recorded basis, with mid-single digit core organic growth in ESS and continued growth in BSD. The difference between the reported and organic core growth rates reflects the foreign currency headwinds in the quarter.","The trends in the end markets where we primarily participate, residential, commercial and industrial, continue to be consistent with what we highlighted in December. We continue to benefit from new product introductions in high growth region penetration, as we saw in China and India in the first quarter.","ACS margins are expected to be up 80 to 100 basis points driven by good conversion on higher volumes, commercial excellence, and continued productivity net of inflation, while maintaining the investments for growth I spoke about earlier.","In PMT sales are expected to be down 1% to approximately flat on a core organic basis, and down approximately 7% to 9% recorded, driver by foreign currency headwinds and the continued impact of lower oil prices on resins and chemicals.","We're expecting UOP to be down mid single digit on a core organic basis, primarily driven by difficult year-over-year comps in our catalyst business, partially offset by continued growth in gas processing. You'll remember we experienced double-digit sales growth in the catalyst business in the second quarter of 2014.","In HPS we're expecting core organic sales to be approximately flat. We continue to see delays in the conversion of orders and backlog, particularly in the large projects business, offset by software and services growth in our large install base.","On the advanced material side, we're expecting mid single digit growth on a core organic basis, principally driven by continued strength in flooring products. Overall PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 240 to 260 basis points versus 2014 driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable margin rate impact of the market based pricing model in resins and chemicals.","The second quarter will be challenging for PMT however. The second quarter will be challenging for PMT. However, the conservative cost actions we've taken give us confidence in our ability to deliver our forecast.","Let me move to slide 11 for an update on our full year guidance. You can see revised sales and margin targets for 2015. The reported sales growth is expected to be lower than the core organic growth, principally due to foreign currency headwinds. The impact of the friction materials divestiture and raw materials pricing in resins and chemicals.","Our end markets are generally holding up with commercial and industrial momentum, largely offsetting the headwind in oil and gas, and I'll get into more detail on this in a moment.","Our new sales guidance reflects the further strengthening of the US dollar since we provided our initial outlook back in December. For example, we're now playing for a euro exchange rate for approximately $1.10 for the remainder of the year and have similar revisions for other currencies and now expect an approximate $1.7 billion headwind for the top line from foreign currency for the full year.","To remind you, our operating profits are protected from further US dollars strengthening by our hedging approach, even though the top line is adversely impacted. For example with the euro, our operating profits are protected at a rate of about $1.24. And as Dave indicated for 2016 we're taking a similar approach. We put hedges in place to cover approximately 85% of our 2016 euro P&L exposure at the planning rate of approximately $1.10.","On a core organic basis, our sales growth for 2015 is now approximately 3%. This reflects the slow start we had in the first quarter and the risks associated with order delays, we've been able \u2013 we've seen to date, primarily in aerospace and PMT.","In ACS there is some minor puts and takes among the businesses, but overall the outlook for the rest of the year remains intact and we continue to expect good core organic growth, particularly in our short cycle businesses.","We're raising our segment margin targets in all businesses due to favorable drivers previously discussed, including commercial excellence, HOS, restructuring, and a continued focus on managing our costs, as well as the impact to the foreign currency hedges and the market based pricing model in resins and chemicals.","In addition as Dave mentioned, we're raising the low end of our EPS guidance extension [ph] mark-to-market by $0.05 to $6.15 per share, representing 8% to 11% growth versus 2014, and providing the framework for another year of strong earnings growth in what continues to be a challenging global economy.","This range continues to be based on a full year income tax rate assumption of 26.5% and share count held roughly flat to 2014 levels. We continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, up 8% to 10% from 2014 with CapEx investments peaking this year at roughly two times depreciation.","At a more normalized rate of CapEx investment approximately 1.25 times depreciation, we would expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100%, and we expect to be at those levels again by 2017. So overall, still a very balanced outlook for the year.","Let me move on to slide 12. With the first quarter in the books, we thought it'd be helpful to provide an update on how we see things in our key end markets and how they are impacting our planning for the remainder of 2015.","Starting with aerospace, the outlook on the commercial side is largely the same as we outlined in March. As OE build rates and flight hours remain strong. On the commercial OE side, we still expect a benefit from build rate schedules and a ramp up in new platforms, including Airbus A350 and ATR and the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer Legacy 500 and BGA.","Flight hours for ATR are expected to grow approximately 4% in 2015, similar to 2014. And on the business jet side, we expect the flight hours for large cabin aircraft will continue to grow in 2015, up mid single digit reflecting the continued healthy demand in the cabin sized sector we are more represented.","In defense and space, we're seeing strong international demand as defense budgets continue to grow. This is supported by the 20% plus core organic growth we saw in our international business in the first quarter and a very strong backlog. We expect the US portion of the business to stabilize consistent with the US DoD budgets despite the timing delays we encountered in the first quarter.","In the automotive market, we're seeing the market improving as turbo adoption continues in the life vehicle gas segment globally and as light vehicle production picks up. This should bode well for us going forward as we expect to outpace the industry in gasoline turbo wins.","Moving to ACS, residential markets continue to grow at a steady pace as urbanization in high growth regions progresses. We continue to accelerate our investments in the connected home space where we have a strong install base and market channel and where we expect to benefit from new product introductions in both ECC and security.","On the non-res side, we continue to expect acceleration in commercial construction spending and our positive outlook for the full year remains intact despite a slower than anticipated start.","As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong growth in our short cycle businesses in fire and security and expect that positive end market trends will continue to drive growth in these businesses.","As for building solutions, the strong backlog from our projects business and service bank continue to support an improvement for the remainder of 2015. On the industrial side, we continue to benefit from increasing safety standards across the globe, as activity picks up in both the US and in our high growth regions.","So overall, very similar to where we were in March, and good momentum as we head into the second quarter. We've touched a lot on PMT already, but to summarize the impacts from oil and gas are becoming clearer and more pronounced than we initially anticipated. However, we continue to proactively address PMTs cost position and are confident in power managing our exposure to the sector.","In advanced materials, we continue to see robust demand for our low global warming Solstice products, supporting the significant investments we've made in this business heading into 2015 and 2016. We once again saw double-digit core organic growth in flooring products in the quarter.","Let's now move to our updated full year segment guidance on page 13. Let me explain the setup here, the left-hand side of the slide represents the guidance as of our December outlook, and an estimate of the core organic sales growth under those assumptions.","The 5% growth we show here on a core organic basis is on the same basis as the 4% organic growth we previously articulated. We simply restated the 5% to reflect the adjustment for the resins and chemicals price impact.","The right half reflects our current guidance, including the first quarter results and latest outlook by business on a core organic bass. We won't get in all of details again, but just want to highlight that our core organic growth expectations in aero and ACS are down slightly given the slow start and PMT has been adversely impacted as previously explained. However, we continue to expect good margin improvement across the businesses for the reasons I discussed earlier.","We continue to take a conservative approach to the rest of the year. We're committed to our EPS outlook raising the low end, while continuing to invest for the future in seed planting and additional restructuring.","This confidence is derived from the good visibility we have on new products and technologies, our penetration of high growth regions, our conservative cross planning and the deployment of our key process initiative is part of HOS goal.","Let's turn to slide 14 for a brief wrap up before I move on to Q&A. This was another quarter where the Honeywell business model and HOS enabled us to set and exceed challenging performance expectations.","The quarter started slow and not all the markets we participate in were giving us help, but we picked up momentum and exited on a strong note with significant outperformance in both segment margin and EPS.","Our shareholders are benefit from a diverse portfolio with great technologies and long and short cycle exposure, one that continues to derive significant benefits from comprehensive globalization, and one that will further benefit from the significant fire power [ph] that we have on our balance sheet.","With a little more help from the economy, we are well positioned to continue outperformance throughout 2015, all the while seeding and feeding our growth initiatives.","Like all of you, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2015. Each of our HOS Gold enterprises are hard at work on their five year strategic plans, which Dave and his staff will dive into before our next earnings call.","And if you've already heard, some of our early actions we've taken for 2016, including additional restructuring and hedging of our foreign currency exposures. We look forward to sharing more over the course of 2015.","With that, let's move on to the Q&A segment.","Mark Macaluso","Michael, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hey, Scott.","Scott Davis","Guys, what happened in January, I'm \u2013 is there any kind of general theme to why January started so weak for you?","David M. Cote","You know, I wish there was. Interestingly, at least from the talking I did around the horn [ph] we weren't alone. I mean, this was kind of a phenomenon that some even saw in the banking community.","There was just something about January that caused everything to be a slowdown, and I'd have to say I was a little nervous as we were in January, and then things turned in February and turned bigger in March. So I can't explain it. It just happened.","Tom Szlosek","And it was pervasive Scott across the, you know, almost every one of our business units\u2026","David M. Cote","Around the world.","Tom Szlosek","Everywhere.","Scott Davis","Yes, that's amazing. Okay. Good. And then, I struggle sometimes, I mean your margins are exceptional and continue to be on the right path. But what does HOS really mean to margins? Can you quantify it at all? I remember when you went from nothing to bronze, it was a pretty meaningful step up. Is gold as meaning to step up when you come up from silver?","David M. Cote","Yes. Well, it is pretty meaningful I'd say being able to get there. We don't have that many units that are actually there at gold yet. That's one of the things that \u2013 that's why we think there's a lot more improvement left in the company.","It's tough to quantify exactly what the dollar amount is that \u2013 or the rate amount that comes from HOS, but it's going to continue to grow. Because as we've tried to show in the past it doesn't just kind of raise your overall level, but it raises your improvement rate per year also","So think of it is, it's not just a first derivative improvement. It's a second derivative improvement also. So I'm actually quite encouraged about what this is going to continue to be able to do for us.","Tom Szlosek","Yes. And I would add that the way we're defining HOS Gold, as we talked about at the Investor Day cuts across the entire business and enterprise, whereas once it was focused on factories and the supply chain, it now extends to engineering and product development, commercial excellence, dealing with our customers and the like.","So all of those things were contributors as I tried to articulate when I explained that 140 basis point expansion in the first quarter.","Scott Davis","And last just quickly, on M&A is it \u2013 are the gating factors really price or is it availability of assets or both?","David M. Cote","I'd say its more price now than anything else. Prices are just high. This is \u2013 we're going to continue to be disciplined and be smart about this. But prices are high right now, and you haven't heard me say that much in the past, but this time they are.","Scott Davis","Yes. Well, we hear that from everyone. So great, thanks guys. I'll pass it on.","David M. Cote","All right. See you, Scott.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey. Can we just get a little more color on UOP? I may have missed it, Tom, when you went through all that detail. But what were UOP orders actually like in the quarter and, you know, if we think about the capacity that you have coming on, is it still, you know, fully sold and, you know, and how firm is the backlog in that business?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. Well, the orders were roughly flat in the quarter for UOP, but it was \u2013 it was kind of a tale of two cities. The gas businesses are being impacted by delays. We think there was a significant amount of orders that were pushed out into the second quarter and third quarter on the international side. So we're expecting those to come back in.","But on the other hand the technologies and equipment business, performance technologies and equipment had an outstanding orders growth, strong, strong double-digit growth. Catalysts were essentially flat to the year. So overall those were the contributors to UOP. Good activity and the backlog as well. You know, down a little bit, but overall in pretty good shape.","Jeff Sprague","And on the expansion?","Tom Szlosek","And to answer the question on expansion that demand is still there. I was actually at the Jon Hegan [ph] factory in the first quarter, and it will be \u2013 it is starting to run at full capacity. So really excited about those investments that we're making. And the capital spending plans are all on schedule and we're going to hit the targets and get the market benefit.","David M. Cote","On the expansions, Jeff, I'm more worried about making sure we hit the startup date than anything else because the demand for the product's there.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Great. And just on the hedging, is the hedge only on the euro or you're hedging other currencies where you can, at that rate, at that kind of 85% coverage?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, it's not just the euro, Scott \u2013 Jeff. It's all the currencies where we have exposure. We take a comprehensive look at our long \u2013 the currencies where we're long and the currencies where we're short. The currencies where we manufacture versus the currencies where we only sell.","It's a comprehensive model, but in the end we end up doing comprehensive hedging in a number of different currencies, euro, GBP, Australian dollar, others. And we get some natural benefit from currencies that we are currently locking in. So unbalanced it's not just the euro.","Jeff Sprague","And then given kind of the peculiarity of January, I know it's early, but, you know, any thoughts on how April is starting? I mean, there's just so many cross currents out there. Does this pick up in February and March that you saw? Is it continuing into the early part of the second quarter here?","Tom Szlosek","Well, it's a little tough to tell at this point, but we think it's going to be \u2013 I don't know that it's going to be as strong as it was in February and March, but it's certainly going to be a lot better than January.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Tom Szlosek","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hey, good morning.","David M. Cote","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","On the aerospace side you mentioned some funding issues I guess from some customers. I know the GE talked about some supply chain dynamics going on out there, I guess PCP, there have been some issues around I guess seeding with the 787. What is, you know, maybe the flavor of what's going on in the commercial aerospace side? If you could put a little more \u2013 some more details around that?","Tom Szlosek","Happy to clarify that comment, Steve. It was more to deal with the commercial side and customers, you know, emerging market regions, particularly in Russia with the, you know, the impact that the global economy has had and the sanctions it had.","Our customers, some of our customers are experiencing some funding delays. And so we've held up a shipment until we can get those clarified. We're 100% confident it's going to resolve itself and it already is resolving itself in the second quarter. So it's more a matter of risk management than any kind of demand issue.","Stephen Tusa","Does that, I mean I guess Dave at a higher level, is that a comment on what's going on out there financially in emerging markets or is that an aerospace specific type of thing?","David M. Cote","I would say this is more aero specific in certain emerging market countries.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. So not something we should kind of, you know, from a \u2013 just a liquidity perspective out there globally, there's a lot going on with currencies and the central banks, you know, shooting money all the over the place. So I guess that we shouldn't be kind of concerned about this more globally for the economy?","David M. Cote","No, absolutely not.","Stephen Tusa","Okay.","Tom Szlosek","It is definitely concentrated in Russia, Steve, and\u2026","Stephen Tusa","Okay.","Tom Szlosek","You know the size of Russia for us.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Got it. And then just on UOP, what is the \u2013 what's kind of the size of the international opportunity at Thomas Russell again? I know you guys have talked about, I don't know, something like bidding on 10 projects and you guys have given some revenue numbers. I am just \u2013 that business is clearly going to have a little bit of a rough patch here. It's only $500 million in revenues.","But what is kind of the size of international and how \u2013 can you put that in a context as far as what the opportunity there is to kind of fill the hole in 2016?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I'd say it's a little tougher to say how big it could be because we're not quite sure ourselves. It's a lot bigger even than we anticipated when we first did the acquisition, and we continue to be pretty encouraged by the stuff we're finding.","So what we're seeing is a much greater strength on the international side and of course less on the US side. So we expect that the international piece of this is going to be a really good positive for that business.","Stephen Tusa","Can it be\u2026","Tom Szlosek","I can't put a number on it right now.","Stephen Tusa","Right. But I guess can it be somewhat material to that $500 million business in 2016?","Tom Szlosek","Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Okay. So you can see some of that comes through to offset whatever we may see in Russell for 2016. And then one last question, you said $0.10 of exposure to this kind of euro hedging dynamic in 2016, I guess at the Investor Day.","I'm just doing the rough math on what you said, I guess is it \u2013 is it now about $0.15 or is it still around, you know, what's the actual year-over-year headwind number for 2016 as we stand today?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, Steve I would compare the $1.24 that I mentioned that were hedged after the euro to next year's rate which will be $1.10. And\u2026","Stephen Tusa","Okay.","Tom Szlosek","You can kind of apply that to our business. I think the range we gave still is intact.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. So it's around $0.10 still, no real change there?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. It's reasonable to think about it as, like a penny for a penny. So it's reasonable to think about it that way, and I think it's important to think about it in the context of 6 bucks.","Stephen Tusa","Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, thanks.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We will go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. And good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, Dave you mentioned before in answering the earlier question that prices were high and M&A and the current environment is a gating factor right now. I know you're a patient guy sometimes, but how long and \u2013 well, not that many topics right, but how long and how \u2013 what happens on your capital deployment strategy?","Do you start to consider other means of returning capital, or do you just say look, you know, over a long enough cycle it still makes sense to wait. What are you thinking?","David M. Cote","I would say first of all, you characterized me correctly. I'm generally more impatient about things except when it comes to spending money, in which case I want to make sure that we're smart. The New Hampshire chief in me still would bug me to overpay with something.","Tom Szlosek","I have to agree with both of those.","David M. Cote","The \u2013 at the end of the day, though, we're still pretty much going to stick with what we talked about in that $1 billion to $2 billion net cash position at which point we'll start doing more on the repurchase side. And I think that's still a reasonable and a smart place to be overall. So it preserves fire power for those times when we can be opportunistic, but also says we're not going to let this get excessive.","Steven Winoker","Okay. All right. And then the acceleration that this has baked in sequentially for ACS organically, you know, market dynamics that you're seeing in non-res specifically, could you maybe just also give a little more color, are you still seeing that strengthening, are you seeing kind of oil and gas regional slow down impacting any of those projects, the construction ones, not the oil and gas side of it, what are you seeing in that market?","David M. Cote","The way I'd describe it is that it's stronger than our overall organic growth rate, not as strong as we thought it would be, But it looks like a lot of that was, I think a lot of that might have been weather impacted and we're anticipating that it continues to strengthen during the course of the year, Tom anything you want to\u2026","Tom Szlosek","Yes. If you look at the products that serve that or the businesses that serve that sector, the non-res sector Steve, they were between 3% and 4% organic growth for the quarter. So, I think it's very much in line with what we think the markets are doing.","Steven Winoker","Okay. All right. I'm sure you have a lot of people waiting, so I'll pass it on. Thanks.","David M. Cote","All right. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We will go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So interesting on the organic growth, you're one of the few companies we've heard of so far where trends actually got better as the quarter progressed. I mean, you actually had some companies talk about March not happening.","And so I'm curious Dave from your perspective what kind of impact do you think that oil and gas and the currency moved through here in the US are having on just industrial CapEx spend broadly and how that impacts your business?","David M. Cote","I would say on the CapEx side, I mean the only real effect that we're seeing is on the oil and gas piece of this. I'd be hard pressed to point to something elsewhere I would \u2013 where I could say that currency was having an impact on those decisions.","I don't know, Tom, if anything comes to your mind or anything else.","Tom Szlosek","No.","David M. Cote","So, those \u2013 that's the only one that I could see, that's more oil price impacted than it is currency.","Joe Ritchie","It seems like there's more of a direct impact to your business, but nothing indirect that you guys are hearing from your customers today?","David M. Cote","Yes, I would say in general when it comes to FX, the only effect we're really seeing is on the translation side, and as you know we hedged the income number there and so it shows up on the sales side. But preserves the income side, which is one of the reasons our margins look good, and jeez, I think we should be getting kudos for being smart on how we hedged this year and next.","Joe Ritchie","I'll give you kudos, it's by far the number one question I got from investors heading into the quarter. So I think taking \u2013 tabling some of that risk was definitely a smart and prudent move on your part.","Maybe one other question because you did mention the margins. I mean, in your core operations, the margin expansion this quarter really good despite slower organic growth than expected.","You've got this like five year target at the high end of 75 basis points, and you know, assuming organic growth continues to improve with the capacity investments that you've made, it would seem to me that that 75 basis points should be a lot steeper. So maybe some comments around the conservatism around the high end of that guidance range over your five year planning period.","David M. Cote","Well, I would love to see that myself, and as you know, margin rates are a combination of a lot of things, so we're going to continue to drive it. I'm very committed to that five year plan and understand what I promised I'd deliver there.","So there's a whole combination of thing that go into it, and yes, I'd love to see that margin rate improvement continue and I don't see any reason why we don't continue with a triple digit increase this year.","Joe Ritchie","All right, helpful, guys. Thank you.","David M. Cote","See you, Joe.","Operator","We will go next to Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes, so I just wanted \u2013 just come back to this January issue again. And if I just do the rough math and maybe someone can help me out here. It looks like February, March trended up 5%, and I'm sure that benefited a little bit of snap back from January, first of all is that correct.","And secondly, given all the macro volatility, do you think we're in a \u2013 sort of a more volatile month-by-month pattern from here on Dave?","David M. Cote","I don't know that it's going to be more volatile month-by-month. I would say, though, I really do believe that lower oil prices are going to play through bigger in the macro economy than what we've seen so far, especially in the US.","And this is the \u2013 kind of the longest the consumer is gone historically with not spending kind of newfound riches, whether it's through oil price or tax refunds. So I think we're going to start to see the benefit of that sooner rather than later. I don't think it waits until next year.","That being said, I don't want to count on it either because if I'm wrong, that's not a \u2013 not a good place to be. So I don't think that kind of what we saw January, February, and March continues, and then we'll see something that's a little more stable going forward.","Tom Szlosek","And on your first \u2013 your first question, Nigel, yes, you got it pretty much right in terms of the 7 March numbers.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then just a follow up question on the aerospace. You call that tough China comps, you call out Russia, but outside of those regions would you say especially on the ATR side that, you know, airlines \u2013 airline behavior was consistent with plan and did provisioning have any impact on either the quarter or the year-over-year comp?","David M. Cote","Provisioning didn't have that much impact on us that I'm aware of. And yes, airlines have been pretty consistent. And I actually think aerospace improves during the course of the year because of the timing on some of the shipments that didn't happen in the first quarter.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I think also the \u2013 when you look at it by region, it's quite interesting Nigel, and we had mid-single digit growth in spares, ATR spares in the US, but because of those China issues we were definitely weighed down.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then just finally, you announced a big order in Egypt's \u2013 Egyptian refinery, $1.4 million, when does that start hitting the backlog?","David M. Cote","I'm not sure. I don't know if that's in the backlog number yet.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks, guys.","David M. Cote","You're welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you.","David M. Cote","Hey, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Dave, thank you. Dave, there's been a lot of stimulus efforts in Europe to help the economy. We can see a little bit of it in air traffic. What about on the ground in some of the ACS businesses or elsewhere?","David M. Cote","I'd say ACS we're starting to see some improvement. I don't think it hit as fast as what you'd see on the aerospace side. But, yes, we're expecting that that's going to play through especially as that economy gets closer to 2%.","Howard Rubel","Is there any market you can see better. I mean is it still just Germany or you see France improving or Spain or anything of that order?","David M. Cote","I would just kind of \u2013 I'd say leave it as a general comment. The north is still stronger overall, and I think it's going to take a little bit of say a few more months before say some of the southern economies really start to feel it.","Howard Rubel","But it sounds to me, though, like you're being very conservative, and it's still a wait and see. You're not adding people or anything like that at the moment?","David M. Cote","I could say I am definitely not adding people in Europe.","Howard Rubel","I get it.","Tom Szlosek","Howard, just to put a little color on that. The \u2013 I mean, as we've continually said over the last two or three years, Europe and Africa for us have been relatively1%, 0, minus 1%, consistently quarter-over-quarter over quarter. This year was similar, to your point aero was stronger.","We also saw good performance in the turbo business, good volume growth as that \u2013 the gas penetration continues to grow. So \u2013but you know, it nets out to similar to the environments that we've seen in the past for Europe.","Howard Rubel","I appreciate that. I'm just, you don't want them to spend all that money and not get anything for it and you have a lot of early cycle businesses and that's why I asked.","David M. Cote","I think it does \u2013 it will show up Howard. I don't think though this turns Europe around. I do believe that we'll see some short lived impact from all of this. But, at the end of the day they still need to address a lot of their social issues. And they are just \u2013 and my fear is that some of this is going to cause them to delay taking the actions they need to, to become more competitive as a region.","Howard Rubel","And then just as a follow up in a slightly different vein, you have talked a lot about new products. Could you elaborate a little bit on what we might see in a fashion later in the year in terms of \u2013 it sounds like a lot of things are going to happen in ACS either in connected home. Is there \u2013 you know, as you're sort of previewing ideas to the dealers or otherwise when might we expect some rollout and impact from this?","David M. Cote","Yes, as is typical with us and I know you hear me talk about this diversity of opportunity a lot and that there's never \u2013 while there's never any one big thing that's going to hurt us, which I think is a good way to run the place.","There's never any one big thing that's going to make all the difference for us, either, rather it's going to be a series of products in a number of areas that are going to make the difference here.","And I'm actually pretty encouraged in some of the gross margin rate improvement you saw was attributable to just being able to introduce new products at better margin rates because it adds more value. And I think you're going to \u2013 I feel pretty confident you're going to continue to see more of that.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","David M. Cote","You're welcome, Howard.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot for fitting me in guys.","David M. Cote","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Obin","So my question is just a follow up on Joe Ritchie's question. Obviously the margins were fantastic in the quarter. But if I look at your core growth outlook, you know the 18 target is 4% to 6% top line and last year we were below this target and the idea was that we were going to accelerate into 2015. And as I look at your organic growth target for 2015 it seems we're actually decelerating versus 2014, 2 to 3 versus 3%.","So does that mean the plan now is more about margins as opposed to organic growth? Has the balance shifted between the two given what we are seeing now for two years?","David M. Cote","I would say 2018 is still three years away, and things have a way of changing, and of course we're trying to make sure that we end up in that range, that combination of sales growth and margin rate growth. And right now, last year and this year, organic sales were not as good as what we'd hoped for.","Largely because global GDPs didn't even achieve the kind of conservative numbers that we thought we had in there. So I'd say, yes, we're going to make sure that we continue to work on both. If GDP growth isn't there to support that kind of organic sales growth then you'll probably see even more margin rate improvement and vice versa.","If global GDP does start to take off and sales start to improve, well, you'll see more attributable to the sales side. So, we're still committed to those five year targets and we're going to continue to work both of those variables.","Tom Szlosek","And if I could add\u2026","Andrew Obin","That\u2019s a great\u2026","Tom Szlosek","And if I could add the \u2013 as we talked about the Investor Day, we are experiencing really good win rates and we are expecting inflection points at aerospace and in PMT given the investments that we've made and the new platforms we're on.","So, I think that's going to be a nice catalyst and we still obviously \u2013 you know, obviously have our eye on organic growth as a big part of it.","David M. Cote","That's a good point, Tom, and we've talked about that on Investor Day with those inflection points. Those definitely happening.","Andrew Obin","And if I can just squeeze in one technical question, in terms of your change in your methodology for PMT for input costs, what kind of impact did it have in terms of your organic growth number.","Did it have a negative impact for the annual guidance? I just didn't quite understand that?","David M. Cote","It\u2019s about half a point, I'd guess.","Tom Szlosek","It\u2019s about a half a point for the quarter, yes.","David M. Cote","The reason that we excluded Andy is just that it has no impact on operating income, and you want to use that as a proxy for volume and what's occurring out there in your actual shipments.","So the shipments are actually fine. Operating income is just fine, and in fact, it increases our margin rates because of it. So that's why we excluded it because it just didn't seem to make sense.","Andrew Obin","No, terrific. Really appreciate the comment. Thanks a lot.","David M. Cote","All right. Andy, thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dave Cote for closing comments.","David M. Cote","In a difficult first quarter macro environment, we were actually quite pleased with our operating performance, and I hope you were too. Our initiatives like HOS Gold, HUE and software are working, and our business model continues to deliver.","Raising our guidance for the year is a nice display of our confidence in our ability to deliver this year, next year, and beyond. The diversity of opportunity resident in our portfolio really does make a difference in our ability to outperform. Our opportunities far outweigh any risks we deal with, and we're actually pretty excited about where we're going. So thanks for listening. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day."],"10473":["Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 25, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Elena Doom","David M.

Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and the webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Please note that elements of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We also identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2012, as well as share with you our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2013. And finally, we'll leave time for your questions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. You can see Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter despite a still challenging macro environment. As we've said before, our goal is to be known as a company that outperforms and delivers in both good times and bad, and I think our performance and track record really shows that. We had modest sales growth in the quarter. It was up about 1% on an organic basis, yet we still continued to drive margin expansion, up 50 basis points to 15.6%, as well as pro forma EPS growth of 9% on an adjusted basis. And that's using the same tax rate in both periods.","So we're starting 2013 with some positive momentum. First, the short-cycle order rates are improving slightly overall with stabilization in key developed regions and some pockets of growth, particularly in China -- and other high-growth regions. And that suggests a modest improvement in end market conditions. Second, pension is expected to generate income of $50 million to $75 million this year, and that reflects the proactive funding we've done to date, coupled with a higher-than-expected return on assets last year. And third, the euro exchange rate is a bit better. Our outlook assumes an average euro dollar rate of $1.25. We're tracking above those levels today, but who knows what's going to happen with 11 months left in the year.","So for now, we're cautiously optimistic, but it's just too early to tell what direction the economy is going. And we're all well too familiar with the issue, big democracies around the world are still in gridlock over debt and the U.S. is kicking the debt can down the road and finding that kick doesn't quite go as far as it used to. All of these factors make forecasting what's going to happen a real challenge. So we think it's prudent to remain conservative, given that uncertainty. To the extent the items noted are better, it builds contingency to ensure we achieve our commitment. We'll update you in March at our Annual Investor Conference as we always do.","Given the potential economic difficulties, we're staying conservative on our sales outlook, controlling costs and leveraging our enablers, the Honeywell Operating System, Velocity Product Development and Functional Transformation, just like we did in '11 and '12. We're planning conservatively and we're staying flexible, ensuring that we can continue to respond to changes in the market. We're also in the enviable position of having over $320 million of previously funded in-process repositioning, which we continue to execute. And this will give us a lift in 2013, as well as in future years.","So 2013 will be another year of outperformance for Honeywell, and our focus on evolving in everything we do to become better and better creates a bright future even beyond this year. Our strong pipeline of new wins is setting us up for a multiyear cycle of outperformance. As examples, Aerospace was awarded the 737 MAX Bleed Air system and several other mechanical systems wins. We signed an agreement to provide SyberJet with our Primus APEX avionics, and there are also several other unannounced wins. And that's just in Aerospace.","At the Honeywell level, we finished the year with a record backlog, roughly $15.8 billion, with new platform wins across many of our businesses last year. To support this growth, we sustained high levels of R&D spending, up approximately 25% versus 2010. We've also increased CapEx spending 11% in -- last year, and we'll increase it again this year, ensuring that we meet our commitments to our customers, particularly in PMT. So from the earliest stages of developing innovative new products that customers value, to executing on that delivery, the Honeywell pipeline looks full.","We're developing a thinking company, not thinking as in spending days in contemplation or thinking as an anarchy, so you don't have to do what's requested, but rather thinking as in understanding why we do things. That concept underlies our big process initiatives, like the Honeywell Operating System, Velocity Product Development and Functional Transformation. We want to be able to do everything right and fast. It's through our continued evolution that will sustain our outperformance. In a slow growth global economy, this becomes especially important for margin rate growth. These tools have become part of the Honeywell culture, along with our strong operating disciplines and shared best practices, all translating into meaningful productivity gains.","We think that puts us in an excellent position to achieve our 2014 sales and margin commitments as a company. Having Great Positions in Good Industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving every year in each of our 5 initiatives, it really makes a difference. And as always, we'll update you on our progress in March at our Annual Investor Conference, which will be focused this year on delivering 2014. We plan to highlight a number of tailwinds driving enhanced growth and productivity across each of our businesses, which we expect will allow us to deliver on our long-term targets and beyond. Again, we have a high level of confidence that these targets are in range and achievable, which makes for a very exciting future, and we look forward to delivering on that opportunity.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David James Anderson","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for participating on this morning's call.","Let's go to Slide 4 entitled 4Q 2012 Results. And I'm just going to take you through the summer [ph] results for the quarter, which, as you know, came in largely as expected when we gave you our December outlook. Sales for the quarter of $9.6 billion were up 1% on both a reported and organic basis. And on a regional basis, the U.S. was up approximately 2%, Europe was down 3%, China sales were up approximately 10%. Now, sales did come in a little bit better than we expected in December, as a result of both improved organic growth in ACS, as well as Transportation Systems, and also favorability in terms of our assumption on foreign exchange, and all of this drove approximately $50 million in terms of higher sales.","Segment profit was up 5% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 50 basis points. I'm going to walk you through the individual drivers when we go through each of the businesses in just a moment. But a high-level productivity continues to be very strong, more than offsetting inflation and enabling continued investment for growth.","Below the line for the quarter was as expected, which was also consistent with our prior run rates, so no surprises there. And the tax rate was higher. We gave you the guidance on that. It was higher than normal at 30.6%, which is when in keeping with our full year 26.5% rate that we also guided to.","Now pro forma earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment for pension, was $1.10, an increase of 5% on a year-over-year basis. However, if you normalize for taxes, which, recall, didn't impact the full year, just the quarters, EPS growth would've been 9%. And fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.32, which included roughly $1 billion of pretax mark-to-market, and this reflects a discount rate of 4.06% and a return on assets for the year of 13.5%.","And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, representing approximately 150% free cash flow conversion.","So with that summary for the quarter, let's go to a summer [ph] format and summary for the full year 2012 on Slide 5. 2012 sales were up 3% on both a reported and an organic basis to $37.7 billion. Segment profit was up 10%, more than 3x the growth in sales, demonstrating impressive conversion and resulted in 90 basis points of margin expansion to 15.6%. So it's another record year. And you recall that in 2011, we grew segment margin by 90 basis points over 2010, so an impressive back-to-back performance by Honeywell.","Now all of this resulted in pro forma earnings per share of $4.48, up 11% over 2011. You recall, we set the bar pretty high for 2012, and we delivered at the high end of the range. And finally, free cash flow was $3.7 billion, representing over 100% conversion, demonstrating a consistently high quality of earnings and working capital management while funding approximately $100 million higher CapEx in 2012 compared to full year 2011.","So now let's go to Aerospace on Slide 6. And you can see here, fourth quarter sales for Aero slightly down, driven by the expected 6% decline in Defense and Space, partially offset by continued good growth on the commercial side.","Now Commercial OE was up 5% in the quarter. Air transport, up 6%; Business and General Aviation, up 4%, both benefiting from our strong positions on key new platforms. And for the year, Commercial OE was up 19%, or 12% if you exclude the impact of the prior year's BGA OE payments and the EMS acquisitions, so really kind of giving you, if you want, organic look in terms of Commercial OE growth. All of that was driven by increased deliveries for both large air transport, as well as business jets. We saw the benefits in growth in Boeing and Airbus deliveries, resulting from the ongoing ramp-up in production rate and also the continued healthy demand in the mid to large cabin business aircraft segment, where, as you know, we're well positioned and we continue to outperform.","Now the commercial aftermarket for Aero, sales were up 3% in the quarter. ETR was roughly flat. Air transport, roughly flat. We saw some moderating growth, as expected, in business aviation in the aftermarket as we begin to lap significantly tougher year-over-year comps. We also saw higher U.S. airline inventories, and that weighed somewhat on spares orders in the fourth quarter. However, overall flight hours remained positive, up 1% in the fourth quarter. And we expect flight hour growth, as you recall, to be up in the 2.5% to 3.5% range in 2013, which will continue to drive growth in the aftermarket, albeit at a slower rate than what we experienced in '12.","Now for Defense and Space, I talked about the 6% down as expected in the quarter. We lapped, of course, difficult comps that resulted from the wind down of the TIGER program. And we had lower space sales and some other programmatic completions, but, again, on track relative to expectations. For the full year, D&S was down 3%, slightly better than we had originally planned for the year. And Mike Madsen and the team, Tim Mahoney and the team, really deserve a lot of credit for their pursuit of international opportunities, which are continuing to mitigate some of the budget headwinds that we expect in both 2013 and beyond.","Now margins for Aerospace in the fourth quarter, they expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 19.9%. For the year, segment margins grew 130 basis points to 18.9% as a result of terrific sales conversion, also driven by commercial excellence and material and operational productivity. I'd also point out that adjusted for the BGA OE payments that I've referenced earlier, Aero's margins would still be have been up an impressive 60 basis points in the year.","So let's go now to ACS on Slide #7 and take you through again the highlights for the -- for both the fourth quarter and -- as well as for the full year of 2012. Sales for ACF -- ACS were up 3% in the fourth quarter on both reported and organic basis, in line with the full year organic rate of about 3%. Regionally, the U.S. was up 4%, Europe was up 1%, China was up 7% organically, with signs of stability in the developed markets and also, obviously, improvement in high-growth regions, mainly China, in the quarter.","Let's go through some of the highlights for the major business segments of ACS. For ESS, for Energy, Safety and Security, sales were up 4% on an organic basis, reflecting an uptick from the roughly flat sales growth we had through the first 3 quarters of 2012.","Now Environmental Combustion and Control, ECC, saw significant improvement, up 6% organically in the quarter, driven by modest recovery in the North America and China markets but also easier year-over-year comps.","We also saw continued strength in both Security and Scanning & Mobility, driven by new product introductions, as well as contract wins. And importantly, we believe the sensing and control business declines have now leveled off. And this is important, obviously, because this business has really been a leading indicator for our shorter-cycle businesses, and we're expecting improvement there over the course of 2013.","Process Solutions sales for ACS were up 3% organically in the quarter. Project orders were down, driven by continued extension of project timing by customers and also difficult comps versus the fourth quarter of 2011, where we booked several very large projects. You recall us talking about that in the December guidance call in terms of really that expectation for HPS orders. Important to note, we have seen an improvement in backlog margins for HPS. That's really due to the continued focus on accretive growth and it's been a contributor to ACS' overall margin rate improvement.","Finally, for Building Systems -- or Building Solutions and Distribution, BSD, sales were up 1% organically in the quarter. We continued to see energy orders push out due to a challenging funding and capital oversight environment for Building Solutions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and this is being partially offset by good growth in China and also in some of the other high-growth regions.","Now I think what really is notable on this slide is the ACS margins, up a strong 110 basis points in the quarter to 15.5%, which, by the way, is a new record for ACS. And this performance was driven by, again, the theme of commercial excellence and productivity, net of inflation. For the year, segment margins for ACS were up an impressive 70 basis points to 14.1%, and importantly, ACS had margin expansion in 2012 in every business.","So now let's take a quick look at PMT on Slide 8, Performance Materials and Technologies. You can see PMT delivered another strong year, with record sales and segment margins while continuing to invest for growth. Sales for the fourth quarter for PMT were up 8%, 2% organic. Of course, the 8%, driven primarily by the Thomas Russell acquisition, as well as new product applications in Advanced Materials. Those mitigated a weak macro environment across Advanced Materials.","Now the fourth quarter sales at UOP were up 13% reported, but down 4% organic as expected, due to the timing of catalyst shipments, the big catalyst quarter expected now in the first quarter of 2013. For the year, UOP sales were up 17%, 12% organically. They ended the year with record backlog of 2 point up -- $2.8 billion, up 49% year-over-year or 18% organically, driven in part by a series of major wins towards technology to produce petrochemicals in both natural gas, as well as coal.","Now Advanced Materials for PMT were up 5% in the quarter, 5% organically, consistent with the positive growth we've seen in some of our other short-cycle businesses. However, fluorine products in Resins & Chemicals continued to see tough markets overall, and we will expect that to continue somewhat in 2013. That said, we also expect a ramp-up in new product offerings as we enter new -- important new products, and those are going to provide tailwinds for us over the course of 2013 into 2014.","Segment profit for PMT was down 6%, but up 11% for the year. Margins in the quarter, as expected, down about 200 basis points, primarily driven by the lower UOP catalyst shipments I referenced and also some unfavorable Resins & Chemicals price-to-raws relationship. However, for the year, segment margins for PMT were up 30 basis points to 18.7%, so a very impressive 2012 for PMT. And we continue to expect -- we get this question a lot about PMT and in terms of the ongoing run rate in terms of its margins rates, and we expect that to continue to be in the 18%, 18.5%-plus range. Andreas's team will continue to execute on a number of smart investments, and they'll continue to capitalize on growth opportunities that lie ahead. And I'm sure he'll probably talk about that at our March Investor Day.","Transportation Systems, Slide #9, performing well despite the challenging European macro environment. Sales in the quarter were down 8% organically in TS, against a very difficult quarter for light vehicle production in terms of the industry. We anticipate that industry down approximately 10% year-over-year. However, TS has seen the benefit of new platform launches. It's also seeing its higher gas penetration benefits in both the U.S., as well as in China.","Now we saw some signs of stabilization in Europe as we exited December, coupled with a modest uptick in China for the fourth quarter. However, we continue to expect a difficult environment for Europe in the first quarter, and we think it's prudent to plan -- as Dave said, plan conservatively and watch the market closely while preparing for an upturn later in the year 2013.","Segment margins were down for TS, 130 basis points in the quarter, but just 50 basis points for the year. And of course, the margin degradation is driven by lower volumes, some unfavorable mix in foreign exchange, partially offset by very strong productivity and actions by Alex and his team. Now we're investing, obviously, to continue to improve the efficiency and flexibility of Transportation Systems. And we've got an overall cost -- improved cost and competitive footprint in both Turbo and Friction, and we're going to see these benefits driving further productivity gains as we progress over the course of '13 and, of course, 2014.","So let's now go to Slide #10 and just do a quick repeat -- reprise of our 2013 guidance. As you can see, we're reaffirming 2013. Our '12 results finished as expected. And as Dave referenced, the year-end U.S. fiscal compromise didn't do much to change our view of the macro environment. That uncertainty still hangs out there. Now we're still expecting sales to be up on a reported basis, 4% to 5%, 1% to 3% on an organic basis.","One thing I do want to point out here is that we planned, and this builds on Dave's point that he mentioned in his opening remarks, for the midpoint of our guidance to be an average rate of $1.25 for the euro and continue to think that's the prudent planning approach. However, as we've indicated on the bottom right of the page, a strong euro or a stronger euro is one of the drivers that could push sales and segment profit towards the high end of our range. Now obviously, on the other hand, business mix, other items could push us to the lower end.","Now below the line items, we'll have some puts and takes, but we're expecting the net to be favorable on a year-over-year basis. And a component of this is that $50 million to $75 million of pension income in 2013 that we now expect, slightly more tailwind than we indicated when we gave guidance in December. Now this positive is driven by the proactive funding we've done to date, and you recall that funding in '10, '11 and as well as '12. It's also attributable to a higher-than-expected return on plan assets in 2012 and partially offset by a lower assumed rate of return that's effective in 2013. Now we're still operating with a range for pension income, given the formed plan estimates for which we don't anticipate to be finalized for a few more months.","Now importantly, on the tax front, we're still planning for a 26.5% rate, unchanged from 2012. Earnings per share $4.75 to $4.95, up 6% to 11%, over the $4.48 for 2012. And we'll continue to generate strong free cash flow despite higher levels of CapEx spending that we'll have this year to really fund growth investments.","So in summary, we're sticking with our guidance from December with a higher level of confidence and with potential upside that, for now, we think make sense, as Dave said, to hold this contingency and could be used, among other things, to fund repositioning and other actions in the year, given the uncertainty that is still prevalent in the economy.","So now let's go to Slide 11, and let's talk about the -- then the so-what-of-that [ph] for the first quarter. For the first quarter, we're expecting sales, as you can see, to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, flat to up 2% on a reported basis. EPS, we're expecting to be in the range of $1.10 to a $1.15, in line with that 6% to 11% increase that we're looking for the full year for 2013, and represents roughly 23% of our full year guidance. So that's in line with our normal linearity.","So with that, let's take a look at the businesses, just a couple of points on the first quarter for each of them. Aero, we expect sales to be roughly flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued modest Defense and sales decline, we're thinking of the -- that D&S will be down about 3%, and also some challenging comps on the commercial side, both on the OE side, particularly BGA, and also on the aftermarket.","ACS sales we expect to be flat to up 2%. Overall, we're seeing stability in their major end markets with pockets of growth emerging. We're also expecting low single-digit growth in both HPS and BSD, which are in line with those recent order trends that I talked to you about.","For PMT, we're expecting sales up 7% to 9% or flat to down slightly on an organic basis and driven by a robust quarter for catalyst shipments in UOP and the addition of -- obviously, of Thomas Russell adding to that reported growth, providing tailwind to us. Advanced Materials, on the other hand, is expecting mid- to high single-digit declines, due to the challenging end market dynamics and also some lower volumes for PMT.","Finally, in Transportation Systems, we're expecting sales to be down 5% to 7%, driven by continued weak light vehicle production, particularly in Europe, as we referenced earlier. And we're also expecting EU light vehicle production, that is the industry, to be down again in the first quarter in the range of about 10%. And we also expect some continued foreign currency headwinds, and, again, that may be mitigated if we continue to see some favorability in terms of our euro-to-dollar assumption.","So as you can see, a relatively modest planning assumptions around the top line sales across the business but generating, again, very good EPS growth in terms of our outlook for the first quarter.","So with that, Elena, before we go to Q&A, let me just summarize on Slide #12. Obviously, 2012 was another great year for Honeywell, another year of outperformance. We set and we met high expectations, particularly as it relates to earnings growth and cash generation. Now we also continue to invest for the future, doing, as Dave said, smart things that will continue to deliver value in future periods.","Now as we turn the page to 2013, we're planning another year of strong margin expansion in a slow growth environment. We've seen signs of stability. The horizon looks a little brighter than it did even a couple of weeks ago, but nothing to suggest that anything less than conservative planning is best at this point.","The Honeywell playbook is working. We're continuing to evolve as a thinking company. We're improving and leveraging our key process enablers and our productivity tools. We're growing faster than our served markets, and we're doing everything more efficiently to drive continued outperformance versus our peers.","Now 2013 is an exciting year for us, not just because of what we're going to do this year, but because it's another yardstick closer to the 2014 targets we set back in 2010. We've got a lot of momentum as we prepare to make the final push for 2014, with tailwinds across a number of the businesses for growth, as well as increased productivity.","And again, as Dave said, this is going to be the focus of our upcoming March 16 Investor Conference in New York City, delivering 2014 from innovation to execution. And as we continue to evolve as a company, the strong portfolio that we've created, the unified One Honeywell culture and our continuous improvement process disciplines, these are the keys to how we're going to deliver the 2014 targets and continue to position for strong outperformance beyond that.","So with that, now, Elena, let's go over to you for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Dave.","David M. Cote","March 6.","Elena Doom","Just one clarification, so Investor Conference, March 6 in New York City.","David James Anderson","Thank you very much.","Elena Doom","Kevin, if you could now open the line, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One of the things that you didn't address in the presentation was cash reinvestment for 2013. I'm guessing since you don't have to make a pension contribution, you're probably sitting on a fair amount of cash at this point. I mean, what's your thought on to potentially buying back some stock? Or are there more deals out there, like Thomas Russell, that maybe you can comment on that?","David M. Cote","Well, a couple of comments, then I'll turn it over to Dave. But -- we did go through a bunch of that in the December call. Our plan really haven't changed all that much. We raised the dividend by 10%. We bought back some shares in December last year. We're saying we'll hold share count about flat with the fourth quarter this year. And as we've said in the past, I mean, that policy still hasn't changed when it comes to acquisitions and additional repurchases. We're going to be opportunistic about what do we think make sense, so hasn't really changed from what we said in December. Dave, anything you want to add?","David James Anderson","No, I would say absolutely we're on track for that. And you obviously fund the Intermec acquisition, Dave, during the course of the year. The one thing I would just say is -- obviously, is the acquisition pipeline continues...","David M. Cote","That looks good.","David James Anderson","Continues to be attractive. We're going to continue to leverage our strong disciplines, both in terms of price paid, as well as execution and the integration. But that looks good. I think the share buyback is absolutely on track. We're going to have over $1.3 billion cash outflow for dividends in 2013 and, obviously, very positive feedback that we're getting in terms of that continued rate of growth on the dividend. So that's really the story, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. The -- one of the highlights to me in the quarter, at least, is the ACS margin. And we've talked about this, I think, for several quarters. Things have been progressing really nicely there. I mean, we -- I don't think in our model we had ACS margins over 15% until like 2016 or something. So you're way ahead of that pace. What -- when you think about this quarter, the 15.5% number, you referenced kind of positive inflation impact, and maybe that is some impact. But help us understand what's sustainable on that kind of over 15% level, and what may be more a transitory or mix related?","David M. Cote","Well, for ACS, I mean, none of this stuff is transitory. This is kind of consistent with that concept of evolution in everything that we do, that we've talked about, is we're just going to keep steadily building on what we've done before. So I fully expect ACS continues to increase their margin rates, just like I expected in Aero, I expected in PMT and TS and total company. So we're not very subtle. In fact, I can't think of any transitory or onetime gains that we generally ever let fall through on anything. We tend to use those for repositioning. So I'd say very sustainable. Dave, anything you...","David James Anderson","Well, I just say that we have 14.1% margin for ACS for the year, which is a record. We're going to continue to build there. It's really -- we hope we're going to get a little more volume leverage. That would be terrific. I mean, I think we would see really terrific conversion there, I mean, everything that Roger and the team are doing on the productivity, on the cost side of the equation. So it's -- you're going to see -- there's going to be sequential differences. First quarter is going to be different than the fourth quarter. But when you look at really year-over-year, as Dave said, it's a sustained improvement that we're really targeting, and the business is confident that they're going to be able to deliver. And the formula, Scott, you know the formula that we're using.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. No, I think what I was specifically referencing is you do talk about inflation. So I'm guessing that there's a price-cost spread that's in there that has some sort of an impact that we wouldn't want to model that going forward. So I'm not talking about onetime gains or anything like that.","Elena Doom","Yes. The -- just -- Scott, on the price to cost side, it's actually slightly unfavorable. But ACS is mitigating that through strong material productivity and even building on their performance in the quarter. They also offset some negative mix of roughly out 20, 30 basis points in the quarter. So I think it's productivity across-the-board, both in terms of operational productivity and material productivity.","Operator","We go next to the site of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So obviously, you alluded to the fact that you got a bit more contingency in the plan, due to maybe where the FX rate is right now and some other factors, such as pension, but obviously, keeping a conservative view on the year. But I'm wondering if we're in a situation now where perhaps there's some -- there's a few more good guys than bad guys as we go through the year. What does the -- how does the repo pipeline look at this point? And is the policy to accelerate repo this year and maybe flow it through next year, or do you see the potential for maybe a balance between additional repo and perhaps upside to the plan?","David M. Cote","Well, we always want flexibility on repositioning. We're always looking at projects. But as you know, we've got over $300 million worth of projects that are already funded that we need to work our way through. We like having the flexibility in the event that there is a really good idea that comes forward. But just executing on what we've already funded is going to be a real boost for us going forward. And I think we've provided those numbers for this year, and I don't know about 2014.","Elena Doom","Yes, the incremental benefit that we're assuming is roughly $150 million in 2013.","David M. Cote","This year, yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does that then flow through into '14 as well? Is there an incremental into '14, too?","Elena Doom","There is, Nigel. Off the top of my head, I don't have that, and I think it's something we can provide, certainly, in March.","David James Anderson","Well, the important thing maybe, Elena, just to add to that, is we funded on a gross basis, $120 million of repositioning in 2012.","David M. Cote","Already on top of what we'd...","David James Anderson","We've already done. And so -- and by the way, some very attractive...","David M. Cote","Good projects.","David James Anderson","Payback projects. And so what you'll see, Nigel, and we can follow up on that, and clearly, we'll have more about that when we get together in March, on March 6, that you're going to see there is strong -- there'll continue to be strong incremental benefit that'll flow into 2014.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fantastic. And then just digging into PMT margins. I just wondered what impact the Thomas Russell acquisition had, due to accession accounting in the quarter. And you also mentioned unfavorable price\/raws. You guys have done a great job of mitigating the raw material volatility, particularly within the Resins business. And I'm wondering, has there been a change in the dynamic now where price\/raws becomes more of an impact going forward?","David James Anderson","Well, on Thomas Russell, we had, obviously, favorability in terms of -- I cited that when I talked about the reported versus the organic sales contribution that Thomas Russell made. Also, Thomas Russell was actually accretive in the fourth quarter. We actually had -- it made a positive contribution. We had talked about that earlier, just in terms of the excitement that we have for the transaction, both in terms of tremendous complement that it gives to our current gas technology and gas positioning in UOP, but also what we think we can do to continue to leverage its strength, its marketplace strengths in terms of the financial performance. So we saw that in the fourth quarter. We're going to see a continued benefit, obviously, in 2013.","David M. Cote","But it was margin rate...","Elena Doom","It was margin rate...","David James Anderson","Margin rate dilutive.","Elena Doom","Yes, about 40 basis points for the quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, yes. And the price\/raws?","David M. Cote","Our price\/raws -- well, R&C has been dealing with a decreasing spread throughout the year. I don't see that spread getting worse during the course of this year, but that's something that they just work on managing going forward, and like you said, it's become less of -- significantly less of an issue for us, just in terms of how we manage the entire business. So I don't see it creating any issues for us this year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from the site of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein & Co.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just first question, is the Defense and Space view of sequestration changing at -- or changed at all since the fall, based on the activities over the last month?","David M. Cote","No. I would say that we're staying in the same place we've always been. And that planned conservatively there because you just don't know what those guys are going to do down there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then you commented on the energy orders push-out in BS&D. Can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing there in North America? And what your sense is for that changing?","David M. Cote","Yes. It's good the -- that whole market has slowed down just because state municipal budgets are all struggling to get money right now to even investigate or look at anything. Even though these end up being cost-free projects, it still just causes everything to slow down. And that's the phenomenon that we're dealing with and it's across the industry.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And Transport for next year, I mean, given your comments on Friction, historically, I think, hoping for breakeven by 2014 and all that, are you still kind of hanging in there for that business unit over the next 6 months?","David M. Cote","As in what sense?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As in thinking about their ability to drive to the margin targets, given the -- what's going on in Friction, as well as volumes in Europe?","David M. Cote","Yes. Yes, we're -- we think they have a doable plan. We're going to continue to fund the transformation that we've talked about. And that's not the most pleasant of situations to deal with, but we're going to stick with it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one last. You mentioned -- the words you mentioned about 6x was -- in the presentation, 2014 and beyond, and that we're going to hear about 2014 and beyond in March. Can you just give us a little clarity on are you suggesting that you might be thinking about more specific targets this year as opposed to next, or you're just sort of speaking generally?","David M. Cote","Very generally. The great unveiling will be in 2014 of the next 5-year plan.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. Great. Well, we'll keep asking.","David M. Cote","Now that, I'm relatively sure.","Operator","We'll go next to the site of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Can you just post us up where we actually finished on pension from a funded status, both in percentages and dollars? And should we expect that you are done funding for, really, the foreseeable future?","David James Anderson","Yes, we finished that at about 85%, maybe a little less than that, in terms of funded status for the year. I think that's about...","Elena Doom","$3.5 billion.","David James Anderson","$3.5 billion in terms of underfunded balance. And I'd say in terms of your -- the second part of your question, in terms of are we done, I think that's very much TBD. As we've talked about before and as you're very familiar, this is a very discount rate-sensitive phenomena. The math is really driven significantly by discount rate, and we talked about this a little bit in December. If you just go back to the numbers in terms of discount rate that we had in 2009, 2010 in the...","Elena Doom","5.25%","David James Anderson","5% to 5.25% range, you're basically at a fully funded status. So I think it's prudent for us to have done what we've done, which is to done the prefunding over the course of '10, '11 and '12, to be in the position that we are now. We've seen, obviously, continued historic lower rates. We've had headwinds in terms of number of our major markets. So I think now is an excellent time for us to shift that focus, do what we're doing for 2013 in terms of capital and cash redeployment. But we're going to have to say it's a wait-and-see attitude, where, hopefully, what we're going to see is some improvement in terms of rates, and that's going to really address most of this issue. Meanwhile, on the accounting side, we're going to benefit here in 2013, as we've said, from a little bit of pension income. And we expect that'll probably continue into 2014 at about that same level, given where rates are today. Again, that is also interest rate or discount-rate sensitive. But I think for now, we feel very comfortable with what we're doing, the strategy that we've employed, and it'll have to be wait and see going forward to make any kind of further statement in terms of beyond '13 or '14 in terms of funding.","David M. Cote","Just to add to that, we wanted to kind of stay in the sweet spot, where, at some point, rates do go up, markets will do better, and you don't want to be in a position where all of a sudden you end up with a significantly overfunded plan. By the same token, you don't want to be in a position where you don't have critical mass in the pension, so that when things do get better, rates go up, whatever, you still stay underfunded. So we've been trying to manage to that sweet spot, and we think we're there. And with just a little bit of help from rates and from market return, then there should be no need to put money in the pension fund for a while.","David James Anderson","One other quick thing, Dave, if I could add, which is effective also with the beginning of this year, we've lowered our rate of return assumption from 8%...","David M. Cote","8% to 7%.","David James Anderson","to 7 point -- 7.5%, 7\u00be%, which we also think is smart and, again, is consistent with our conservative approach on this issue. So that's another element of it, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just backing into some rough numbers, though, it looks like if you earned your ROA, you actually earn enough to pay your annual benefits payable and you hold this thing stable as long as discount rates don't go lower.","David James Anderson","Right. I think that's right.","David M. Cote","Pretty much, yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. Just on the deal front. Do you still see Intermec closing kind of in the May timeframe? And given that Thomas Russell is off to a strong start, have you raised your sights a little bit there on accretion for 2013?","David M. Cote","I'd say with Intermec, we'll see, but that's kind of the way we're thinking about it now is sometime during the second quarter. With Thomas Russell, yes, we're really pretty excited about what that can do for us in terms of what we can get on the order side. So I think we can grow that pretty well.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then just one other quick one. Just thinking about this contingency that's been created early in the year. Should we think of any upside from dollar, euro falling through kind of at the average Honeywell margin rate, or is there some other complexity there to think about?","Elena Doom","Jeff, the sensitivity is really for every $0.01, it's roughly $50 million in sales and about $7 million of operating income. It's sort of our back-of-the-envelope math that will see this through.","Operator","We'll go next to the site of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions, Dave and Dave and Elena. First, you've done some very interesting drop-in and complementary acquisitions of late, and you've talked about Thomas Russell a little bit. Could you just elaborate a little bit and give us a little sense of how some of the other acquisitions have done lately in terms of complementing what you've done? EMS stands out as another example.","David M. Cote","I'd say, well, it's not just the recent past. If you take a look at the whole 10 years, the acquisition process that we have really works. And I mean, I am hard pressed to think of one that's been bad that was of any consequence. We had some smaller ones that didn't work out as well as we'd hope, but nothing has been a big miss. So EMS, to your point, stands out because, there, we ended up getting a $2.8 billion order that we hadn't even counted on as part of the valuation. Thomas Russell has been excellent right from the start, and we think the opportunity there is going to be even bigger. We're excited about what we think Intermec can do to broaden our portfolio. So I'm -- we've built a great safety products presence. So I think this is one of those capabilities that we really have as a company. It's not something that we do as one-off every 4 or 5 years, dust off the book and figure out what you have to do. It's more kind of in the psyche of the company. It's just how we do things. They've all worked out pretty well. I can't think of one that isn't something to brag about.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I agree. I just thought maybe there was something to add in terms of how it's 1 plus -- I don't want use the trite expression 1 plus 1 is getting 3. But there's an element of what you've found is that as you've done some of these, there's other market opportunities that have been uncovered. And that's what the focus of the question was.","David M. Cote","Well, that part is true is that it's one of the nice things about kind of broadening our portfolio is that we end up seeing more new areas to be able to go into. And EMS is a good example, because that's really broaden the -- open the aperture for Aerospace as they think about what they do in that segment.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then the follow-up, just to go on Aerospace. You've had a number of notable wins, some are announced and some are not. How are you thinking, Mr. Anderson, about the incremental BGA investments this year?","David James Anderson","And, Howard, are you talking specifically about some of the RD&E investment?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David James Anderson","Well, as we've said, we're looking for Aero to be basically flat on a RD&E as a percent of sales. We talked about that when we gave our December guidance. It's a good question because I think one of the challenges we have overall at Aerospace is it's an opportunity-rich environment. And despite us being selective, and that's something that we've been very, I think, clear in terms of our direction with Aero, it's something I think that's really served us very well, and it's going to continue to serve us very well in the future. Fact of the matter is it's a robust pipeline, and we'll continue to manage that. And we just -- I think that's one of the things that we've just gotten better at in terms of execution. It also underscores, as Dave talked about, just our operating disciplines and just getting better in terms of managing innovation, program management and delivery. That's -- you're just going to see that translate, we think, into just even a stronger Aerospace in the future, stronger Aerospace group for Honeywell in the future, Howard. And also it's consistent with what we continue to say in terms of the upside. It'll translate into margin expansion and improvement for the group. So the BGA opportunities are big. As you said, there's opportunities there that haven't been announced, publicly announced or stated. But we think that pipeline is very rich, and we'll continue to manage it effectively.","Operator","Take our next question from the site of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You guys gave a backlog number last year. I think this year, you gave just the long-cycle backlog. Last year, I think it was $16.2 billion, of which 74% was going to be shipped in 2012. This year, I think it's 15 point -- if you could just give me either the total backlog, and then more importantly, what you expect that long-cycle backlog, how much of that is going to be shipped this year in '13?","Elena Doom","Steve, the comparable number that you're looking for is $16.8 billion. In terms of the comparable number, the $15.8 billion that we quoted is really the long-cycle backlog that would ship within 24 months. So there's...","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay, that's very helpful. On the PMT margins, I think you said, going forward, 18% to 18.5%. You guys did 18.7% this year, but you guided up 0% to 20%. So maybe if you could just clarify those comments.","David James Anderson","Well, I think when I was talking about that, Steve, I was talking about longer-term sustainable targets directionally. One of the things that we've been asked a lot is can PMT sustain this kind of performance, this kind of performance track record. So what I was really referencing was the fact that we had confidence. Another way of saying it is we have confidence in PMT stability to do that, so the collection of the technologies that we possess, the market positions, the richness of the NPI, the new product backlog in terms -- from research standpoint, as well as what we just see in terms of the continued global macro trends and market opportunities. And you take an example of that now, the addition of Thomas Russell and our key position in natural gas liquids. That's -- and you're -- we've acquired a company there that's basically got a U.S. footprint with significant growth continued in the U.S. but also now international expansion opportunities. That's the type of thing I'm saying in terms of the sustainability is really what you should look to as opposed to a specific number.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then one last question, just on the incremental pension tailwind. How do we read you guys as having this kind of, like, hedge out there as opposed to you guys have been pretty smart in the past about taking some of this upside and offsetting it with restructuring? Do we read this as there's nothing you really worry about today so you let -- the more -- the likelihood of that just kind of flows through, or that you're kind of out of opportunities for restructuring? Just a little curious as to why you're kind of not -- right away, kind of calling that out and offs -- and saying, at some point, we're going to offset that with restructuring?","David M. Cote","Here's the way I would look at it is, over the last 2, 3 weeks, let's say, some of the economic news looks like it's gotten better, but this is not the first time we see 2 or 3 weeks that look good...","David James Anderson","That's right.","David M. Cote","Followed by stuff that really doesn't look good at all. And government is still not showing a capacity for dealing with its debt problems. And we're all concerned that, at some point, this thing turns again and turns in the other direction. We just think the smart thing to do now is to stay conservative and stay prepared. There's -- I see very little downside to being prepared for the downside, and that's the way you're just looking at it. And we're saying, \"Okay, better to have this in our pocket to be prepared to deal with that downside.\" If it doesn't happen, well, there is restructuring opportunity, there is let-it-fall-through opportunity, there may be other investments that we'll do. Right now, just because the news looks a little better the last couple of weeks, but we just don't think this is a good time to declare economic victory.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dave Anderson, you had talked about, in your December preview, caprolactam headwinds. And between the capro and the benzene price declines, is there a -- just remind me, is there a formula that you -- or that we can look at that says for every percentage change this is the impact on PMT? And then just kind of the corollary is, what do you think of PMT margins sort of sequentially as the year progresses based on, I think, your previous comments regarding sort of spreads? I think, Dave Cote, you said you expected spreads to kind of remain not worse or whether in terms of the impact.","David James Anderson","Well, again, that, call it the benzene add or the formula that exist in terms of market pricing, gives us a directional indicator. It doesn't give us a precise. You can't plug that in and determine what the outcome is in terms of the margin or the profitability for R&C or for PMT. Because we serve so many different markets, and as you would expect, John, it gets kind of complicated. But it is a macro indicator of the health of the overall -- that overall business space, and it's an overall indicator for us in terms of -- from a planning standpoint, directionally, in terms of the profit performance that we expect out of that business and also an indicator of volumes. Because as you would suspect, when you get weaker demand, some of that translates into weaker commodity pricing. So that's one of the challenges that we have going forward. On the other hand, with PMT, we expect to see continued good margin performance over the course of the year. We are going to see a very good first quarter 2013. And the reason is -- and we've been signaling that, is we're going to have very strong catalyst deliveries in UOP that's -- that looks like it's absolutely on track. So we're going to have exceptional performance there over the course of the year. But we expect another good year in terms of overall PMT margins. But like...","Elena Doom","With a little less variability compared to what we saw at the end of 2012.","David James Anderson","Right.","Elena Doom","Looking forward to 2013. Because, John, to your point, we're going to have lapped the year-over-year impact of the R&C caprolactam to benzene at our spread.","David James Anderson","Or stated differently, the second, third and fourth quarters, those are going to be more consistent...","Elena Doom","More consistent, right.","David James Anderson","And more -- to one another in terms of the sequential margin rate that we'll see out of PMT.","Elena Doom","There is a seasonal element to the fourth quarter margin in PMT, which, on average, can be roughly 150 basis points of the decline, driven by, really, fluorine products, specifically. But other than that, as Dave mentioned, we expect there to be much more consistency in terms of the margin rate performance in 2013.","David James Anderson","Yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Actually, that is quite helpful. I wasn't sure how you'd have the confidence, if you were -- there was no predictive readthrough. But that answers that very well. 787, I realize Aerospace is very diversified. It's about flight hours. But you guys have a pretty good content on that program. Is there any discernible impact in the guide, even if it's just minor, or is it just not really that relevant?","David M. Cote","It's not going to have much of an impact. I mean, there are some -- there are obviously some sales from it in the year. But even if they stopped producing, which I find hard to believe, that's manageable for us.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Then just last. Dave Cote, ACS has been a -- has been and is expected to continue to be an important source of productivity. How are you thinking about productivity opportunities in emerging markets? And the reason I'm asking that point is that there are lots of reports of increasing automation proliferation because of rising wage costs in China and other places. You guys, as a company, although you've closed the gap, were behind, I would say, a few years ago in emerging markets. You've closed the gap. Is this still a period of time for Honeywell to be investing? Or are there opportunities to also perhaps drive productivity because of these -- just because market conditions are changing in the China and Indias of the world?","David M. Cote","Well, I guess, a couple of comments there. First one is the opportunity for us to be able to expand outside the U.S. is still significant. While we have grown our percent of sales outside the U.S. from 41% to 54%, 75% of the world's GDP is outside the U.S., so still a lot of room for us to grow. When it comes to productivity, we look at productivity in everything everywhere and in every country. And we break it out into the 2 pieces that we've talked about before, is material and organization effectiveness, or OEF. And we look at every business that way, thinking about what's the smartest way to make both of those happen. And that doesn't really change, I'd say, as a result of wage rates going up in China or going up in India. Yes, it's something that you manage, but it's not so overwhelming that it requires drastic change in the company or exit stage right or enter stage left. I mean, nothing like that. So very manageable, and we'll continue to do that within that kind of framework, looking at material and looking at labor and just keeping it as simple as that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So basically, on a net basis, you're still in the build phase, very much so, it sounds like, for the next few years, in emerging markets versus a -- versus more of a cost phase, if you want to look that up on that basis.","David M. Cote","Well, we always look at is growth and cost at the same time. I've never been a believer that you just do one or the other. So that's why we've got it teed up in the 5 initiatives the way we do. So we're constantly looking at both. None of this stuff has been a real surprise. But we still see a lot of opportunity to grow, and we still see a lot of opportunity to take out cost and just driving those big enablers of ours, Velocity Product Development, the Honeywell Operating System and Functional Transformation. There's a lot of margin rate improvement and customer benefit from doing all 3 of those just a lot better than we do today.","Elena Doom","All right, Dave, I'd like to hand it over to you for final comments.","David M. Cote","Okay. So while the economic times still remained difficult, we are going to continue to focus on what we can control to deliver outperformance regardless of the economic conditions. And at the end of the day, you have to play with the economic cards that were dealt. Until governments truly deal with their debt issues, that's just the way it is. We could wish it was different. But the best thing we can do is just play conservatively, assume that these great things aren't going to happen and stay very flexible in what we do in terms of our ability to respond. So we're going to continue to evolve the company in everything we do. And you know that word evolution is one that I use a lot, because I think it's important for organizations, for people, for companies, for processes, because we want to stay flexible to be able to respond to changing conditions and we want to be able to improve on all dimensions.","A couple of weeks ago, we had our annual meeting of our top 300 global leaders. And I -- it's just fun to be able to tell you about the excitement that you can feel from the top 300 people in the world for Honeywell when it comes to what they know we can accomplish as a company and where we're going. I mean, the feeling was palpable. It was the sort of thing that really pumps you up. So as a Honeywell team, we look forward to demonstrating that continued outperformance that results from all that excitement for all the great groundwork, all the great seed planting that our guys have been doing for a lot of years.","Thanks for listening.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me here today are our Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the second quarter and share with you our guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2015. Finally, as always we\u2019ll leave time for your questions at the end.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.","David Cote","Good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth capping off a strong first-half to the year and positioning us well to achieve our fully year outlook as we head into the back-half.","Reported earnings per share of $1.51 increased 10% normalized for tax coming in at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Sales of $9.8 billion were up 3% on a core organic basis. We saw organic growth accelerate in both the short- and long-cycle businesses within Aerospace, continued growth in our commercial and industrial businesses within ACS, and higher volume across our Advanced Materials portfolio, particularly in Fluorine Products.","Each of our business segments achieved the sales estimates we provided in April and we expect that the sales acceleration we enjoyed this quarter will continue into the second-half of the year.","The absence of friction materials, strengthening of the U.S. dollar and raw material pricings in Resins & Chemicals drove the difference between reported and core organic sales growth. Segment margin expanded 170 basis points to 18.4% in the second quarter and similar to last quarter large portion of the margin expansion came from improving gross margins. Strong execution across portfolio drove margin expansion in each of our three segments at or above the targets we communicated in April.","Our Enablers and key process initiatives continue to deliver growth and productivity benefits and our previously funded restructuring actions provide the runway we need to continue improving our operations and cost base. We\u2019re keeping that pipeline full, which is critical to supporting our continued margin expansion into next year and beyond.","We proactively funded about $39 million of new restructuring in the quarter building on a healthy pipeline of new projects. While managing cost is critical, we\u2019re also seed planting, and that is investing in capacity expansion, new products and technologies and resources in high-growth regions to drive future growth. We also continue to benefit from the strategic portfolio decisions we\u2019ve made in the past, and we\u2019re well-positioned and aligned to favorable macro trends with significant runway to grow.","There continues to be a lot of exciting activity across the portfolio driving our strong results, so I can\u2019t help, but highlight a couple. In June, our Process Solutions business hosted their 40th annual Honeywell Users Group or HUG, America symposium. A forum that provides users of our process control and industrial automation systems an opportunity to exchange technical information and provides feedback on their equipment service needs.","The sentiment was decidedly positive and the turnout of over 1,200 channel partners, end users, and Honeywell sponsors from over 300 different companies was our largest ever. Customer interest in Process Solutions that drive increased safety, reliability, and greater efficiency was noticeably higher than prior years.","In addition, Process Solutions announced a partnership with Intel Security to help bolster protection of critical industrial infrastructure and data combining the latest advances in cybersecurity technology with Honeywell\u2019s unique industrial process domain knowledge, another example of our smart investments and commitment to growing our software capabilities, which we see as a key differentiator.","In Aerospace, we announced last month an agreement to supply our advanced Primus Epic cockpit technologies to Dassault\u2019s newly unveiled Falcon 5X. The new plane combines the latest features for safety and performance, including smartview synthetic vision, next generation flight management system, interview weather radar, and smart traffic collision avoidance, while achieving the lowest fuel consumption in this category.","Our Aerospace team in Dassault developed the next generation cockpit with the future in mind, giving pilots and operators advanced communication, vision, and awareness features that simplify their jobs. And in PMT, our Fluorine Products [Technical Difficulty] additional $600 million in orders, with key OEMs for our Solstice low-global warming suite of products, bringing lifetime value of signed agreements to approximately $3.2 billion. We also have an additional $200 million in agreements currently under negotiation, which we anticipate finalizing by the end of the year.","Our Solstice product has global warming potential less than CO2, making it a terrific choice for products and for companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. EPA phase-out rules restricting the use of high-global warming hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs in a variety of applications, including refrigerant, aerosol, and foam insulation blowing agents, coupled with approvals for the use of two additional Honeywell Solstice refrigerants as replacements for high-global warming HFCs continue to show that we are invested in the right place.","The demand and adoption of Solstice products continues to be a great story for Honeywell. As we look ahead, we\u2019re not counting on a significant uptick in the current macroenvironment. But we are confident in our ability to deliver continued sales growth and to leverage that growth drive further margin expansion. As a result of our strong first-half performance, we are again raising the low-end of our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range by a $0.05 to a new range of $6.05 to $6.15, up 9% to a 11% versus last year.","We have a fantastic portfolio and we\u2019ll continue investing in high-growth regions, high ROI CapEx, and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost discipline and ensuring we deliver the savings from restructuring projects funded over the past few years. We\u2019re in the midst now of our strategic planning reviews of each of the three segments, and we\u2019re excited about each business\u2019s innovation pipeline and growth opportunities.","Over the next planning period, you can expect us to build on our track record of outperformance through the consistent execution you come to expect from Honeywell. We continue to enhance our focus on each of the 74 HOS Gold Enterprises, which we believe will make us more entrepreneurial and nimble versus our competitors by identifying breakthrough strategies and moves into smart new areas and adjacencies. I look forward to sharing more with you, of course, as the year unfolds.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I\u2019m on Slide 4, which shows the second quarter results. Sales of $9.8 billion were up 3% on a core organic basis, each of our segments met or exceeded the top line guidance we provided in April, led by our Commercial Aero \u2013 the commercial and industrial businesses within ACS, and Advanced Materials. And I\u2019ll talk about each of these more on the business slides.","We\u2019re encouraged by the acceleration from Q1 and the momentum we have exiting the second quarter bodes well for the second half. As Dave mentioned, the Friction Materials divestiture, foreign currency and the raw materials pricing in Resins & Chemicals, all resulted in the reported sales decline this quarter.","Segment margin expanded 170 basis points to 18.4%, that\u2019s 20 basis points above the high-end of our guidance. Each segment is contributing to the impressive profit growth and margin expansion this quarter, and good volume and strong operations are playing a big part. On the volume side, our continued investments for growth in sales, marketing and new product development drove higher volumes in the quarter.","On the operating side, we continue to drive improvement in our gross margin rates and continued moderation of our G&A rates through HOS Gold deployment, and our focus on commercial excellence, new product development, functional transformation and strong cost controls. Items below segment profit were favorable on the year-over-year basis as we had anticipated. Higher pension income was largely offset by additional restructuring. New restructuring projects funded this quarter were approximately $39 million building on our over $300 million plus pipeline as of the end of Q2, which positions us well for continued margin expansion throughout our five-year plan.","We delivered the high-end of our EPS guidance range with earnings per share of $1.51, up 10% normalized to our expected full year tax rate of 26.5% in both periods, once again achieving double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Finally, free cash flow, $1.2 billion, 5% higher than 2014. Free cash flow conversion was 98%, and we expect to be in a net cash position of between $1 billion and $2 billion by the end of the year, there is no significant M&A activity. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow growth environment.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5. Our segment margin rate expansion was again very robust this quarter, as you can see a majority of the improvement is coming from our operating initiatives. The benefits of HOS Gold are paying off and we\u2019re seeing that in every segment\u2019s gross margin rate. We have attractive products with differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our factories and supply chain are well run and our back-office continues to get more and more efficient. In addition, new product introductions and further penetration in high growth regions, particularly at ACS, where we grew close to 10% in China, and greater than 15% in India during the quarter, are also big part of the story.","The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions enable us to continue to improve our overall cost position. Also our segment margin rate was positively impacted by the Friction Materials divestiture, our foreign currency hedging approach and the Resins & Chemicals pricing model, collectively to the tune of approximately 60 basis points. We sold Friction Materials in July of 2014, so we will lap this benefit in the second-half of 2015, but this is a permanent improvement to our margin rate from exiting a business that did not meet our great positions in good industries criteria.","On foreign currency, our hedging strategy as you know is to protect our operating results even as sales do fluctuate with changes in currency, another solid quarter of margin improvement driven by our operating system and key process initiatives.","Moving to Slide 6, in the Aerospace results, sales up in the second quarter 3% on a core organic basis, above the high-end of our guidance range driven by good volume growth and execution. Commercial OE was up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by double-digit improvement in Business and General Aviation engine shipments. Engine demand continues to be robust and we expect to see continued Commercial OE growth in the second-half, particularly in BGA. Air Transport was flat, a reflection of the pluses and minuses in our customer build schedules for the quarter, while on the Regional side we saw lower sales volume overall.","Importantly our installed base continues to grow in both ATR and BGA, which is a good sign for our future aftermarket business. And to that point, Commercial Aftermarket saw a nice improvement from the first quarter. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong growth in repair and overhaul activities, and ATR spares sales, partially offset by lower BGA RMUs, or Retrofit, Modifications and Upgrades, in many cases, software based.","RMU sales growth can be lumpy based on the timing of new product rollouts, and as you recall 2014 was an extremely strong year for RMU sales. And looking forward, we\u2019re excited about our new product pipeline in this area. Overall, we saw a good growth in the aftermarket and anticipate further improvement in the third quarter and through the second-half of the year.","Defense & Space, sales were up 1% on a core organic basis, driven by near double-digit growth in our international defense business. Here we continue to see strong demand in the aftermarket, and for our training propulsion engines and missile navigation products in South Korea and other high growth regions including Turkey. Well, in the U.S. our sales were slightly down.","Finally, Transportation Systems sales increased 5% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches, strong volume growth in light vehicle gas applications globally and growth in diesel applications, particularly in North America. This was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. On reported basis TS sales declined 25%, reflecting the Friction Materials divestiture and foreign currency headwinds.","On segment margin, the favorable impacts of the Friction Materials divestiture and our foreign currency hedges were drivers of the 140 basis points expansion in Aerospace, along with commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments.","TS was a major contributor to the margin enhancement in Aerospace this quarter. Not coincidentally, that\u2019s a business where we see the greatest advancements in our HOS Silver certifications in our plants.","Let\u2019s turn to the ACS results on Slide 7. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the second quarter, continuing the positive core organic growth trends we saw in the first quarter. High growth regions continue to stand out in ACS and we have good momentum heading into Q3 based on recent order trends. The margin expansion was robust and we once again exceeded the high-end of our margin guidance range.","ESS, the products business, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis in the second quarter, driven by strong performance in our Scanning & Mobility, Fire Safety and Security businesses. Scanning & Mobility achieved its third straight quarter of double-digit core organic sales growth, driven by volume from recent wins, most notably the U.S. Postal Service agreement, and new product introductions in China where we continue to build on our Easter-East [ph] pipeline to support future growth.","We anticipate similar volume growth in the third quarter and will discuss in more detail shortly. The rest of ESS also continues to benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. From a regional perspective, China was up high single-digit, while in India sales were up over 15% with broad-based strength across the ESS portfolio.","Building Solutions & Distribution, sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the second quarter with continued strength in the America\u2019s Fire and Security Distribution business. We saw continued organic growth in our project backlog and service bank this quarter, driven primarily by the Asia-Pacific region, which will help support a modest acceleration in the back-half of the year.","ACS margins expanded to 120 basis points \u2013 by 120 basis points to 16% in the quarter. The business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volume and significant productivity improvements net of inflation. We also continued our investments for growth, particularly in new product development and in high-growth regions. Our efforts to drive the more connected ACS, which Alex spoke about at our March Investor Day provide a runway for accelerating growth and continued margin expansion as we drive incremental synergies among our businesses through supplier rationalization, footprint consolidation and back-office improvement.","So in total another strong quarter of sales growth and margin expansion in ACS and continued outperformance in their key high-growth regions.","I\u2019m now on Slide 8 to discuss PMT results. PMT sales in the quarter, $2.4 billion, down 1% on a core organic basis consistent with the guidance we presented last quarter. And we exceeded the high-end of our segment margin guidance by 70 basis points driven by strong execution and productivity action.","Starting with UOP, sales were down 8% on a core organic basis due to declines in our Gas Processing, and Equipment and Engineering businesses, and the timing of catalyst shipments which we had previewed. Orders were down in the second quarter throughout the business, which is adversely impacting backlogs. However, activity in our Gas Processing business, both domestic and international is encouraging, and we expect orders in that business to accelerate in the third quarter, which along with the timing associated with catalyst reloads, lots of some of the softness we are seeing in UOP.","In Process Solutions, our portfolio is broader and more diverse than our competitors. We have a unique combination of automation technology, field instrumentation products, and aftermarket offerings in the form of contracted and spot service, software, and consultative solutions that our competitors do not have. So while our short cycle field instrumentation business faces headwinds like many others in the industry, we are seeing sales growth in our high-margin software and service businesses. Customers are looking to our optimization solutions for productivity enhancements to their current asset base.","So overall, HPS core organic sales were down 4% and our orders were down only 2% in the quarter. Our large projects business had strong orders in the quarter, particularly in the Middle East, where we see infrastructure investments continuing. The HPS backlog is solid and increased over 15% organically, which gives us confidence in our growth projection.","Advanced Materials sales were up 8% on a core organic basis, the growth was broad-based across the entire portfolio. Fluorine Products grew double-digit for the fourth straight quarter, as demand for Solstice low-global warming products continue to escalate.","As Dave mentioned, we presently have roughly $3.2 billion of signed agreements and another $200 million under negotiation. To-date in 2015 alone, we signed over $900 million in new orders. In addition, sales in both Resins & Chemicals and Specialty Products grew on a core organic basis on higher volumes as new product introduction here continue to drive results.","On segment margin, the PMT leadership team got out ahead of the market pressures to ensure we deliver the 2015 commitments. Q2 segment margins exceeded our guidance and were up 330 basis points to 21.3%. This was driven by a significant productivity action, net of inflation, commercial excellence, and the impact of raw materials pricing in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by continued investments for growth. PMT continues to aggressively pursue further cost reduction opportunities, which should help sustain the strong margin expansion we\u2019ve seen in the first-half of 2015.","I\u2019m now on Slide 9 with a preview of the third quarter. We\u2019re expecting total Honeywell sales of $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, which would be up 3% to 4% on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up again approximately 120 basis points to 140 basis points, and we expect our margin rates to benefit from operational excellence and good execution similar to the first-half margin expansion.","EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.51 to $1.56, which is up 6% to 9% normalized for tax at 26.5% in both years.","Aerospace sales are expected be up 3% to 4% on a core organic basis. In Commercial OE, we expect that core organic sales will be up mid single-digit driven primarily by continued healthy engine demand in the mid-to-large cabin business aircraft. In commercial aftermarket, we expect core organic sales to be up low-to-mid single-digit with continued repair and overhaul and ATR spares growth, partially offset by modestly lower BGA spares sales.","Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low single-digit on a core organic basis driven by continued strength in the international business, where we anticipate double-digit growth, offset by a slight decline in the U.S. Transportation Systems sales are expected to be up low to mid single-digit on a core organic basis driven by both light-vehicle gas and diesel turbo volumes.","We expect Aerospace segment margins to increase 80 basis points to a 100 basis points in the quarter, driven by commercial excellence, further productivity improvements, and the favorable impacts of the Friction Materials divestiture, which will realize through July.","ACS sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% on a core organic basis with mid single-digit core organic growth in ESS and low single-digit core organic growth in BSD. We expected growth in ESS will be driven by our scanning mobility, fire safety, and security businesses along with the benefits from new product introductions and high-growth region penetration.","ACS margins are expected to be up 50 basis points to 70 basis points, driven primarily by good conversion on higher volumes and continued productivity net of inflation. We will continue ramping up investments in new product development in adding feet on the street in high-growth region.","PMT sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. We\u2019re expecting UOP to be down mid to high single-digit on a core organic basis, primarily due to licensing and equipment declines and difficult year-over-year comps in our catalyst business. But partially offset by modest growth in the gas processing business. In HPS, we\u2019re expecting core organic sales to be slightly better than the second quarter as growth continues in our higher margin software and service businesses. And we see a modest uptick in our process technology business driven by a conversion of large projects in the backlog.","HPS continues to be a strong contributor to the margin rate improvement in PMT, driven by sales growth in our higher margin software and service businesses and productivity initiatives. In Advanced Materials we\u2019re expecting high single-digit core organic growth, principally driven by continued strength in Fluorine Products, as well as improving volumes in Resins & Chemicals and Specialty products.","Overall, PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 230 basis points to 250 basis points, driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin rate impact of the market-based pricing model in Resins & Chemicals. While second half of the year will be built \u2013 will be challenging for PMT, the strong growth in our Advanced Materials portfolio and our disciplined cost management and productivity initiatives give us confidence in our forecast.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 to address the trends we\u2019re seeing in our key end markets and discuss how they\u2019re impacting our outlook. On balance, you can see an overall positive perspective, beginning with nonresidential portion of ACS. We expect the acceleration in commercial construction spending and our positive outlook for the year, the full year remains intact. We saw strong growth in our short-cycle businesses in Fire Safety and Security; and expected new wins, commercial excellence, and initiatives in high-growth region as well as positive end market trends will continue to drive growth in these businesses.","As for building solutions, the firm backlog in our projects business and growth in our service bank supporting improvement for the remainder of 2015. On the industrial side, we continue to benefit from the demand for productivity solutions and increasing safety standards across the globe, as activity picks up in both the U.S. and in our high-growth regions. So overall, good momentum as we head into the third quarter after solid core organic growth in the second quarter.","In Aerospace, our outlook on the commercial aftermarket continues to improve. Flight hours for Air Transport and Regional are expected to grow to approximately 4.5% in 2015 slightly above 2014.","And on the business jet side, we expected flight hours for large cabin aircraft will continue to grow in 2015, up mid-single digit, reflecting continued healthy demand. We anticipate that the good growth we saw in R&O this quarter will continue in Q3 and Q4, while sales of BGA\u2019s \u2013 spares will also improve, in part driven by the RMU portfolio. So overall, we expect a modest acceleration in the second-half of the year for Aerospace \u2013 Commercial Aerospace that is.","In Defense & Space, we\u2019re seeing strong international demand as defense budgets continue to grow. This is supported by the high single-digit core organic growth we experience in our international business in the second quarter. And our strong backlog, although still a modest headwind associated with lower governments funding levels, we expect the U.S. portion of the business to stabilize consistent with U.S. DoD budgets. Overall, we remain on track for low-single digit core organic growth for Defense & Space in 2015.","On oil and gas, we actually are seeing a very robust level of proposal activity in both UOP and HPS. And in some pockets orders are expected to accelerate, such as in the UOP gas processing business, where we expect a reasonably strong third and fourth quarter for modular equipment offerings outside the U.S. But on the balance, we\u2019re not expecting a broader recovery for UOP order rates in the near term.","In Process Solutions, we anticipate continued growth in orders in the second-half in our solutions in software businesses and expected a good portion of the large process technology orders booked in the first-half will also convert to sales. Activity in the Middle East continue to be strong, while in other regions including China and Southeast Asia we anticipate a continued slowdown in order activity for Process Solutions.","As for the rest of the Honeywell portfolio, Commercial OE, Transportation Systems, the Residential Businesses in ACS, and Advanced Materials, we\u2019re expecting continued good growth in the second-half. Our installed base in Commercial OE continues to grow with good wins on the right platforms. Global penetration of turbo technology particularly for gas engines will continue and our track record of flawless launches in TS remains a key differentiator.","On the residential side, we expect growth to continue as we accelerate investments in the connected home space and build on our strong position. And in Advanced Materials customer demand for our low global warming suite of products is increasing and we are encouraged by the continued adoption of Solstice on a global basis.","I\u2019m turning to our full year guidance on Page 11. As Dave mentioned, based on our strong first-half performance, we\u2019re raising the low-end of the full year EPS guidance range with a new range of $6.05 to $6.15. Everything else is pretty much intact as we head into second-half of 2015. We\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to perform in a challenging environment. We\u2019re highly confident we can do the same again this year.","Full year sales expectations remain in the range of $39 billion to $39.6 billion, up approximately 3% on a core organic basis. There are some puts and takes among the businesses, but overall remain on track to the full year guidance we provided in April. On the segment margin, we\u2019ve increased our full-year guidance by 10 basis points on the low-end, as our deployment of HOS Gold continues to drive a better more efficient operating system both in our plants and in our back-office.","We now expect segment margins of 18.4% to 18.6%, that\u2019s up 140 basis points to 160 basis points versus last year excluding the impact of the fourth quarter $184 million Aerospace OEM incentives. On EPS, the new guidance range results in 9% to 11% increase from 2014. Again, we\u2019re planning for 26.5% tax rate in third quarter, with fourth quarter tax rate a bit lower to get to our full year planning assumption of 26.5%.","Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, up 8% to 11% from 2014 even with CapEx investments rising to roughly twice that of depreciation. Each of the businesses remains focused on driving further working capital improvement in the second-half. So overall, we\u2019re forecasting another very strong year, solid organic sales growth and strong execution that yield excellent segment margin and free cash flow outcomes, and another year of double-digit EPS growth which would mark our sixth consecutive year of having done so.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12, and in summary \u2013 for the summary, we had a solid first-half and with second quarter performance again at the high-end of our expectation, adding to our strong performance track record and creating momentum for the rest of the year.","The uncertainty in the macro-environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We\u2019ll continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on strong restructuring pipeline we\u2019ve already funded. Innovation and new product introductions remain a key priority, as well as the investments we\u2019re making to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity.","We\u2019re in the process, as Dave mentioned, of planning for the long-term including 2016 and beyond. And our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that with our balanced portfolio mix, alignment to favorable macro trends and focused cost disciplines, we\u2019ll continue to outperform.","So with that, let\u2019s move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Okay. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to give everybody the opportunity to signal. Okay. And we will take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","David Cote","Hey, Scott.","Scott Davis","Hey, I\u2019m going to say the usual congratulatory language, Dave, you\u2019ve\u2026","David Cote","Well, thank you. It\u2019s still nice to hear it, Scott.","Scott Davis","Yes, I know it. Well, it\u2019s good\u2026","David Cote","I know it kills you too.","Scott Davis","It does. It does. Anyway, Dave, help us, I was going to ask about capital allocation, but I think that\u2019d be a wasteful question at this point.","Well, what are you seeing in the world, Dave? And the reason why I asked that question is, last quarter you had 2% core growth, I think it was this quarter 3% core growth, next quarter you\u2019re kind of guiding to 3% to 4%. So you\u2019ve been sequentially improving or at least talking about sequential improvement. But the world seems like it is almost going the other direction that sequentially and maybe degrading. Are you not seeing that or kind of help us understand how the macro lines up with the guidance?","David Cote","Well, I wouldn't say, we\u2019re seeing a boomlet and that\u2019s not what we try to convey, but all in all, I think starting off with what was generally a slow first quarter for everyone when it came to sales growth, things have in my view improved a bit since that time. And I\u2019d say a lot of this is coming more under what we are able to control and what we are able to do, and we\u2019re seeing better performances in our businesses being able to take advantage of the growth trends that do exist.","I would also say Scott, we benefit some from this diversity of opportunity that you hear me talk about. So that, yeah, okay, we've got some oil and gas exposure, but we we\u2019re able to manage that, and it doesn\u2019t have such a deleterious effect on our performance that we can\u2019t manage above it. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s more a combination of things and saying that it\u2019s slightly better than it was, but it\u2019s still not a boomlet. Tom, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to add there.","Tom Szlosek","No, I would agree with that. The only piece of color to maybe provide is that the, when you look at the month sequentially, April was definitely the lowest from a growth perspective, up slightly where \u2013 whereas the momentum picked up in May and June, and got us to that 3%.","Scott Davis","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Guys, how do you think about the interplay between growth and margin? And what I mean is I mean, you\u2019ve been crushing in on margins, core growth has really been in pretty much in line with the group now for most of the last couple of years, give or take a point. Is there \u2013 are there conversations you have internally around that going after margin might be hurting price in some \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, might be hurting growth to some extent, or is that just not related at all?","David Cote","Well, the two are interconnected, but I look at it differently. And if you go back to the beginning of my tenure here, I\u2019ve always said growth and productivity go together that as you grow, you become more productive, because you have more volume leverage, you\u2019re able to leverage your fixed cost better. By the same token the more productive you become, the more money that gives you to reinvest in the thing you\u2019d like to do.","And as you know, I\u2019ve always been big on this concept of seed planting. And that was pretty costly in the early years, because we pretty much had an empty pipeline on everything whether it was high-growth regions, new products, new strategies or technologies, we really had to fill the pipeline, so margin expansion was a little more muted back then, because we had to fill the pipeline on everything, and it took us five or six years to do, which unfortunately took us right into the recession when, yes, we were getting benefiting from some of that, but it was just a hell of a lot less visible.","Well, now that we\u2019re able to get some of the sales growth that we do, we\u2019re much better we\u2019re able to have get that sales leverage as minimal as it might seem in today\u2019s environment, we\u2019re still able to get leverage from that. And we\u2019re able to, I\u2019d say finally, start seeing the benefits of HOS and some of our other initiatives on the gross margin side. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the real leverage here. The two go together and I can promise you we\u2019re certainly not under investing whether you look at R&D or CapEx, or new product programs or commitment to Huey is certainly not a case under investment, because we want to make sure we make not just this quarter, but this same quarter three years from now and six years from now.","Scott Davis","Makes sense, the track record is there. So thanks, guys, and good luck, and have a great rest of summer.","David Cote","Yes, thanks. You too.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs and Company.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","David Cote","Hey, Joe, thanks.","Tom Szlosek","Good morning, Joe.","David Cote","It\u2019s nice to hear, it stated with no reluctance at all, Joe. Thank you. I\u2019d like to go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, we differ in that way.","Tom Szlosek","Just that way.","Joe Ritchie","The first question I have is really around China, and you guys seem to still be doing incredibly well there growing at double-digit, and you\u2019ve had some of your European peers come out and talk about the credit issues recently and peers are starting to intensify a little bit more around the region. I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing specifically in a region whether trends deteriorated at all during the quarter?","Tom Szlosek","Joe, good, I\u2019ll take that one, Dave. The \u2013 yes, China was a very good story for us in most of the pockets. I mean, ACS as we said was near double-digit. Really the changes that we\u2019ve made to connect all of those businesses in China, and get to Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and make investments to help all the businesses in portfolio, running it as one portfolio, really having a huge impact. And, in fact, we expect that to continue. We expect very strong growth rates in Q3 and Q4. In fact, for China, some of our orders are actually \u2013 we use sales as a surrogate for orders. But in some cases we actually do have the orders and what we\u2019re seeing really gives us good encouragement for the rest of the year in ACS.","Aero was also strong. As you know, it\u2019s mostly in spares and R&O business there in China for us right now, up mid single-digits and we do expect that to continue.","TS is a little bit smaller. The commercial vehicles segment in TS was challenged. So we were down in China for Transportation Systems. And then when you look at PMT, some challenges, particularly with cyclicality in UOP, the cat shipments are quite lumpy, can be lumpy from year-over-year. In Q2, we had significant cat sales, so tough quarter from that perspective but we see that improving as we go forward into Q3. So I think all of the businesses are expected to continue to grow and improve from Q2 to Q3, so we\u2019re encouraged by what\u2019s going on.","David Cote","So if I could add to that, Joe, you\u2019d have to say, overall, clearly the Chinese economy is straining [ph] a bit more than it has in the past. But that being said, it\u2019s still pretty good and we see the oil and gas side, Tom\u2019s point, but on balance between the growth that does exist there, plus our own strength as we develop more China-based products, I think puts us in a pretty good spot.","Joe Ritchie","That\u2019s helpful, guys. I guess, maybe following up on oil and gas, and specifically the margins this quarter, they were pretty phenomenal. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can help parse out, the 330 basis points, you can clearly still expect oil and gas margins to continue to be good in 3Q, despite a deteriorating backdrop. And so just help us get a little bit more color into that?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. As you know \u2013 thanks for pointing that out, Joe. PMT margins were up to 21.3% with their 18% last year, so really nice 330 basis points. We had great contributions from \u2013 some volume in Advanced Materials that we talked about, very good productivity, strong cost controls, lower indirect expenses, but also at the same time, as Dave said, continuing the investments. So productivity was definitely a big driver.","We\u2019re also seeing good results in terms of the pricing. That seems to be holding up well. And as I said, there are some things that have driven that down a little bit. The catalyst comps year-over-year, little bit of a tougher story. And then, the overall volume declines that we mentioned in UOP and HPS will drag. So to summarize all of that, it\u2019s a good commercial excellence, good performance on the commercial side, tough from a volume perspective, but really nice work on productivity.","Joe Ritchie","All right. Great, thanks, guys, will get back in queue.","David Cote","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","All right, Dave, a very enthusiastic great quarter.","David Cote","Thank you. I liked your appreciation.","Nigel Coe","Could you feel that coming through?","David Cote","I liked it.","Nigel Coe","Okay. So, obviously, this full year plan pretty much intact, little bit high at the low-end \u2013 on the margin line. Just reading through the commentary, it feels like Commercial Aerospace is a little bit better in the plan; perhaps, PMT a little bit weaker. Is that a fair comment to pass it on?","David Cote","Yes, it is. I don\u2019t know that \u2013 I guess PMT might be a little weaker than what we thought because oil and gas had a slightly bigger impact than we thought at the beginning of the year, but still pretty much within the forecast. And I\u2019m pretty sure \u2013 I think all three segments beat their sales numbers based on what we had committed anyway.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, for the quarter.","David Cote","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Okay. So pretty much \u2013 the mix is pretty much as you expected, okay.","David Cote","Yes.","Nigel Coe","That\u2019s great. Then just switching to the Solstice backlog, $3.2 billion, that\u2019s obviously a very impressive number given the size of that business right now. Do you have any \u2013 can you give us any sense on how that backlog is aging and how much of that backlog converts for the next couple of years?","David Cote","Most of it is all forward. We\u2019re not going to age the backlog, but I would say, it\u2019s going to be a good contributor to us over the next two or three years, especially as you think about that PMT inflection that we talk about, it\u2019s going to be driven by the UOP MTO stuff and the Fluorines capacity, both of which we\u2019re investing in today.","Nigel Coe","Yes, okay. And then just the final one, I think Tom you mentioned 3Q to TS up low single-digits, and I think the expectation is that European volumes might pickup in 3Q. So I\u2019m wondering, number one, do you see that coming through in Europe? And then secondly, are we seeing a big offset from the commercial weakness there?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I think in the second quarter, TS in Europe was, you\u2019re right was pretty strong from an organic basis in the mid single-digits, as we said in line with overall TS, and we see that continuing for the third quarter. I mean, the \u2013 it\u2019s a mix of some platforms expiring and new platforms coming on, and there are some offsets that that also come into play. The commercial vehicles overall for both in China and the U.S. as we talked about has been kind of one of the challenges we\u2019re dealing with. But overall, Europe should be up mid single-digits or even higher for us in the third quarter for Transportation Systems.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, and good morning all.","David Cote","Hi.","Steven Winoker","Hey, Dave, the only thing I can say is that the share price is thanks enough. So I\u2019ll leave it there.","David Cote","Well, we want to keep everybody comfortable, Steve.","Steven Winoker","It\u2019s important Dave, we need these results. So let me just ask quickly on the quarter for Q3 guidance. It looks like, it\u2019s up, I guess, 5% year-on-year, which implies the fourth quarter has got to be up like 15%. Maybe talk about the cadence there, and particularly within aerospace as you\u2019ve got lower margin expansion on higher core growth than you did before. And is that just, even though, that\u2019s a strong 80 basis points to 100 basis points number, is that just makes offset or what are the headwinds there?","David Cote","Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think the b-percents [ph] are quite as dramatic as you indicated. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I mean, the \u2013 we will have a strong \u2013 very strong fourth quarter. There are some nice inflections coming in PMT. As an example, we have, again, there\u2019s some lumpiness in the gas business. But we think that in PMT, we\u2019re going to see some nice growth coming through in those businesses in the fourth quarter. And overall the \u2013 it is our highest quarter from a volume perspective. So there\u2019s \u2013 the base is really driven by what we see the visibility that we have to the sales pipeline.","Steven Winoker","And in the margin \u2013 the margins in Aero even though it\u2019s 80 basis points to 100 basis points, again, the core growth is looking strong and you did more before, is that, what are the headwinds there?","Tom Szlosek","Say it again, Steve?","Steven Winoker","Just in Aerospace, what are the headwinds you are not putting up even higher aerospace margins in Q3?","Tom Szlosek","Well, we get more comparability on from a FX perspective and, of course, Friction Materials is in that \u2013 is in the business as well, so that the two of those temper the significance of the margin increase. So if you go back to that page, I think it was page five in our slide, you see the big impact from those three factors. Those tend to subside as we get further into the year, particularly the FX and the Friction Materials.","David Cote","Friction Materials is mid-July last year.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, but operationally, I mean, all the factors we talk about from an operational perspective, still should hold in pretty firm.","Steven Winoker","And how is the cash flow progress in aero? Is that improving in, as you see that improving, Dave, you\u2019ve talked about a lot of opportunity there going forward?","David Cote","We\u2019ll, the cash flow is still good. They just need to do a significantly better job on inventory than they have in the past\u2026","Steven Winoker","Yes, okay. Okay. All right, and maybe\u2026","David Cote","\u2026which would be upside.","Steven Winoker","And maybe just lastly on gross margin just a little bit bigger picture question. So this is the highest Q2 gross margin we\u2019re obviously seeing in very, very, very long time. So as you see that crossing 30% now, Dave, from a pricing and business model perspective, you think it can continue with that same pace, you think it can accelerate, decelerate, how are you thinking about that?","David Cote","Oh, yeah, I think this is going to be an ongoing phenomenon for us. I\u2019m not going to commit what it\u2019s going to get to at some point. But, certainly, it\u2019s going to be an important factor as we continue to grow our overall operating income percentage.","Steven Winoker","Right. Okay. All right, thanks.","David Cote","See you, Steve.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning.","David Cote","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Dave, the 40th anniversary, Honeywell Users Group, did you guys print up some shirts like, give me a hug or something like that you could send around?","David Cote","Only for you, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. I\u2019ll be checking my mailbox. Hey, just a couple of things. Actually, first, thinking about business jet and strictly large cabin, there\u2019s some crack showing up in what some of the OEs are saying, pressure from wealthy developing countries and the like, sounds like you\u2019re pretty constructive on the back-half. But do you see any reduction in the order books going forward there?","David Cote","Not for us. I would say, while they may be seeing some softness which will get reflected for us also. It\u2019s going to be more than offset by all the gains we\u2019ve had. So\u2026","Tom Szlosek","Both on the equipment side and on R&O, I mean, strong R&O performance as well in the BGA. And it looks like that will hold up for the rest of the year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. And then on gas processing getting firmer, is there \u2013 I guess, you pointed to emerging markets. Is there something really specific driving that? Is there some share gains or what\u2019s actually the driver behind that?","David Cote","Well, if you go back to the premise of the Thomas Russell acquisition that we did then, it was primarily a U.S. based business. We said at the time that our intent was to grow it more internationally, which it takes some time to make happen, but you\u2019re starting to see the benefit of a lot of that from all the seed planting that we did over the last two or three years to make that happen. And that\u2019s mostly the effects you\u2019re getting.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then, finally, maybe for Tom, I was just wondering on the hedges. Have you done anything new there, rolled it forward or are we kind of making the bet here, kind of this whole euro trade has played itself out and we\u2019re going to \u2013 you\u2019re going to let things roll-off? What\u2019s the thought process there?","Tom Szlosek","Well, we\u2019re not betting first of all, but we \u2013 what we told you at the end of the first quarter, we pretty much \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much consistent with where we are right now. So you know the story on 2015, pretty much fully hedged for the rest of the year. 2016, we got the euro hedged probably about three-quarters of the exposure, and some selective hedging in some of the other currencies. We keep our eye on it. We talk about it every week and we\u2019re all closely interested in seeing how that plays out.","Jeffrey Sprague","What\u2019s the exchange rate on the hedge for 2016?","Tom Szlosek","As we said, for the euro it\u2019s $1.10.","Jeffrey Sprague","$1.10, okay, thank you very much.","David Cote","See you, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take a question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hi, good morning.","David Cote","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","Congratulations on the use of the word deleterious. It\u2019s a bit more, it sounds more like Harvard than UNH, but so \u2013 it\u2019s a good work on that.","David Cote","You have no idea of what UNH is capable of, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","On PMT, the UOP business, Thomas Russell, how bad was it in the quarter? And do you think that there is enough out there that you can confidently say that you may be able to kind of fill this domestic hole and actually hold the business flat next year?","David Cote","We\u2019re still in the process of planning everything for 2016, but overall, I think Tom alluded to this earlier, is that we\u2019ve got pretty good quote activity going in both, oil and gas, UOP, and process controls. So we\u2019d like to think, now, that\u2019s \u2013 quote activity is not synonyms with an order. But it\u2019s certainly a nice, hopefully, leading indicator of where things could go. That being said, that\u2019s too early to declare victory.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I mean, sequentially we\u2019re seeing improvement from first quarter, second quarter, and third quarter expectations on orders in the gas business, so \u2013 and there\u2019s is a reasonable degree of visibility to some of the revenues that we expect to see in the second-half. So, as Dave said, we\u2019re watching it closely, but there are some positive signs for that business.","Stephen Tusa","Is there another part of PMT? Are there benefits from what\u2019s going on in downstream margins globally? Or \u2013 it seems like a lot of this stuff is much more UOP-specific, so little bit tougher to call, by looking at just the macro. I mean, is that the right way to think about it? And, I guess, are you still in a growth mode again for UOP in 2016? I know you guys talked about that last quarter that you expected to grow in the 2016.","David Cote","I guess, a couple of things that I mention is, one of the things we\u2019ve said in the past is that you have to kind of break out that oil cycle between the exploration side that\u2019s more price driven and the refining petrochemical side that\u2019s going to be more driven by economic activity. And you\u2019re seeing a bit of a drag on that second part, because of how people have reacted to the first part. But, overall, their margins as you know look pretty good. And we think over time that investment begins. When it comes to UOP, they still got the capacity expansion that\u2019s coming and that stuff, we got to complete that plant on time, because we need to ship, and the projects are already being built. So I certainly feel more than okay about it.","Stephen Tusa","And you still pretty \u2013 you still feel pretty confident with the fluorine stuff coming on with that revenue \u2013 incremental revenue chart you guys put up in March with I think it was like $1 billion in incremental revenue in 2017. Even with the oil and gas macro-headwinds out there that you are \u2013 there is kind of no changes to that view.","David Cote","Yes.","Tom Szlosek","Even better, I mean.","Stephen Tusa","Even better with the Fluorine Products [indiscernible]. And then one last question, any degree of evolution at all on the balance sheet? I mean, you guys are clearly executing well. So you don\u2019t necessarily need to \u2013 there is really not a need for significant urgency around the balance sheet, but any of these properties that you covered loosening up at all with what\u2019s clearly a more \u2013 a tougher micro-environment out there or no change?","David Cote","Well, I would have to say, the strategy hasn\u2019t changed. And like I\u2019ve said with the retail store, you never know when these things are going to hit. You never know when the customer is going to walk in. So, we\u2019re armed and ready.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, but no big buyback near term?","David Cote","Strategy, still the same.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. You called \u2013 Tom, you called this out a little bit, but maybe you could elaborate a bit. SG&A was down substantially, I think it fell from 13.4% to 12.7%. Can you elaborate on some of the causes, some of it maybe FX, but a bunch of it is probably process changes?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. I think the, Steve, when you \u2013 the percentage that you\u2019re mentioning\u2026","Howard Rubel","Howard.","Tom Szlosek","Oh, sorry, Howard.","Howard Rubel","I do not want to get confused. I do not want to get confused with Steve, please.","Tom Szlosek","Yes. I\u2019m sorry about that, Howard. So I think when you look at the percentage you\u2019re talking about, since the FX is affecting sales more than it is the cost numbers, you do get a little bit of a margin impact, but for us the initiatives that we\u2019ve got going on, the continued work that we\u2019re doing in functional transformation, the continued work that we\u2019re doing in managing the indirect cost of those groups and function spend, the e-auction process that we\u2019re using. All the initiatives are really having a solid impact and they\u2019re coming through, so there is not one thing in there, just continued sustained momentum that we got.","Howard Rubel","And then, you talked a lot about one of the things that makes a difference at Honeywell has been new products. And we can see it in Fluorines and we can see it in a few other places. Is there \u2013 do you have a metric that you look at in terms of new sales, new product sales as a comparison to a year ago?","David Cote","Actually, Howard, I\u2019ve always tried to stay away from that, because if you want a metric that can be easily gained internally and externally that\u2019s it. I go more by are we growing faster than our competition. And when I see things like the Dassault cockpit, and what we\u2019re able to do with fluorines, and what ACS has coming, and Huey bases that everybody is using for it; then I know it is happening.","Howard Rubel","I hear you. And then if I could just go back\u2026","David Cote","In another words, if you said, jeez, we want to see 50% of your sales coming from products introduced in the last three years. My guess is every company can generate that metric for you, regardless of how they\u2019re performing.","Howard Rubel","You have a fair point. And then the last thing, I think, a number of people before me have asked the same question in another way. It seems if in PMT the oil and gas expectations that had been laid out earlier have shifted to the right. Have you gone back in and examined exactly why or even have you kind of added some belt and suspenders to the process to make sure that, in fact, the second-half that that you\u2019re looking for is going to play out the way you\u2019d like?","David Cote","We\u2019re not counting on a huge second-half on oil and gas, it\u2019s kind of static, maybe a little bit better, but we\u2019re not counting on anything big.","Tom Szlosek","I think, the \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see an uptick in orders knock on wood for gas we\u2019ve said, as well as for catalyst, but on balance, I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re expecting a major material change right now.","Howard Rubel","All right. Thank you.","Tom Szlosek","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning.","David Cote","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Hey, Dave. Hey, Tom. So you talked about the inflections at aero\u2026","David Cote","Hello, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Yes, hello.","David Cote","A question for you first. How is the ankle?","Christopher Glynn","Oh, thanks, slow, but better than ski season.","David Cote","Well, the rumor we heard is that you drank a six-pack and tried to jump into a dinghy, is that true?","Christopher Glynn","I think it was a 12-pack but, so\u2026","David Cote","Just now you know we have fielders out there too.","Christopher Glynn","I guess, you do. Now, that was a day with the kids, that was a clean day. So like all of them. So with ACS, you talked about the inflections of PMT and Aviation. So with ACS, if we look at a few more years where the macro remains in this way, can HUE and VPD actually drive some acceleration there, or is it 3% to 4% in this environment kind of the reflection of that?","David Cote","I would say, we\u2019re counting on \u2013 3% to 4% is kind of like a nice steady grower in an industry, that\u2019s going to be growing slightly. I do think to your point that kind of the Huey based onslot [ph] that they\u2019re going to be showing over the next few years will make a difference, and there\u2019s a potential for to be better than that. Tough to predict at this point, but I\u2019m encouraged by what I see out of the ACS guys.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And used the word boomlet, I\u2019ll complement you on that on. If you were to see a boomlet, what are \u2013 is an area or two where that could be. I mean, do you have drivers in there for commercial aftermarket or just as an example?","David Cote","Well, I guess I got to be careful that Steve doesn\u2019t put deleterious boomlet together. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s the way I would kind of still describe it. And on the commercial side, I think it\u2019s doing slightly better for us. And you\u2019ll start to see an inflection as we go out into the future, because we\u2019re finally going to see the benefits of all the wins and that starts building our installed base as Tom pointed out on the engine side, which all proves good for us. Tom, anything you want to add there?","Tom Szlosek","No.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we will take our last questions from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Hey, Dave, I thought at some point you would have worked in a free-Brady [ph] into your remarks.","David Cote","And I was expecting you to talk about [Technical Difficulty], Deane, so, I guess, we both were disappointed.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, Dave\u2019s spirit is still deflated on that one.","Deane Dray","Understood.","David Cote","Bad, very bad.","Deane Dray","One of the bullish comments that you had was on non-res. So just may be expand a bit on the dynamics in the market, it\u2019s kind of the data points, it\u2019s just part of the boomlet that you would expect to see in the second-half?","David Cote","Yes, I\u2019d say, it continues to get better as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to see a boom in non-res construction, largely, because there was never a real crash. It was kind of that slow-in, slow-out kind of thing that we talked about with the recession. I think as we\u2019re going to continue to see on the residential side, my guess is, you\u2019re going to continue to see that do better, because rents have been going up and that will spur more activity. But I think for non-res, that\u2019s the right way to think about it, it\u2019s kind of slow and steady.","Tom Szlosek","Yes. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen our best growth in ACS, particularly on the industrial side, industrial piece of the non-res, but commercial buildings as well, trends are very good, the products that we sell into there and ECC, fire and safety or security, all of them are doing well.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to today\u2019s moderator for the additional or closing remarks.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Dave for some closing comments.","David Cote","Well, it certainly feels good to give all of our investors such good news as you look forward to your summer holidays. We\u2019ve got a track record of outperforming our peers and we intend to continue that outperformance. We want all of investors to know that they can enjoy this summer, because they have their money invested in Honeywell.","So from all of us here in Honeywell, have a fun and relaxing summer. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do appreciate your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, April. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude the impacts from separation costs related to the two spin-off of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018 as well as pension mark-to-market adjustment and U.S. tax legislation except where otherwise noted.","References to 2019 adjusted free cash flow guidance and associated conversion exclude impact from separation cost related to the 2018 spin-off. This morning, we'll review our financial results for the first quarter of 2019, share our guidance for the second quarter and provide an update to our full-year 2019 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide two.","Honeywell had a tremendous first quarter delivering earnings per share of $1.92 or $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range and up 13% excluding the impact of the spins in 2018. The strong earnings performance was driven by organic sales growth of 8% and 120 basis points of segment margin expansion. Our outstanding top-line results were driven by continued strength in our long-cycle commercial aerospace, defense and warehouse and process automation\u2019s businesses. In addition, we achieved a significant improvement in Honeywell Building Technologies which delivered 9% organic sales growth in this quarter.","The first full quarter following our 2018 spin-offs after 1% in fourth quarter of 2018 for all of Honeywell, our long-cycle backlog increased more than 10% year-over-year and continues to position us well for the remainder of 2019. The investments we made in our sales organization, new product development and M&A in the warehouse automation business coupled with our winning positions under right platforms in aerospace continued to drive outstanding top-line results.","Segment margin exceeded 20% in the first quarter, driven by smart portfolio enhancements made in 2018, continued investments in sales excellence, increased sales volumes, and the benefits of previously funded repositioning projects. I\u2019m also encouraged by the improvement in gross margin, which increased 300 basis points in the first quarter. Our concerted efforts to improve working capital generated adjusted free cash flow of -- growth of 55% excluding separation costs and the impact of the spins in 2018.","Conversion in the first quarter was 82%, the highest start to the year since 2010, represented a 14-point year-over-year improvement. I\u2019m extremely pleased of the progress we've made in this area while continuing to invest in our business. As a result of our first quarter results and continued confidence in our ability to deliver, today we\u2019re raising our full-year organic sales guidance to a new range of 3% to 6% and earnings per share guidance to new range of $7.90 to $8.15. We continue to expect to generate nearly $6 billion in free cash flow with conversion in the range of 95% to 100%.","As I said in January, Honeywell is a simpler, more focused company that continues to overdeliver on its commitments. We are encouraged by our results, particularly organic sales growth and free cash flow, which were two of my top priorities when I took over as CEO. Notwithstanding the strong start to the year, we continued to take steps to ensure we can deliver on our commitments in a potentially uncertain macro environment, should things slow down in the second half of 2019.","We took significant actions in 2018 to transform the business, the results of which we see in our performance today. Our combination of strong sales growth, favorable end-market exposure and significant balance sheet positions us well for the remainder of 2019.","I will stop there and turn the call over to Greg who will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2019 guidance in more detail.","Greg Lewis","Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin on slide 3.","As Darius mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter across all of our businesses. 8% organic sales growth was the highest we\u2019ve seen since 2011 and an acceleration from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All the markets we serve remained strong.","A few highlights to mention, commercial aviation OE grew 10% organically, driven by demand for new business jet platforms; defense and space grew 13%, continuing the trend of strong double-digit sales growth. Building Technologies grew 9% organically with strength in commercial fire and security as well as in building solutions, particularly in India and China. And our warehouse automation and sensing and IoT businesses delivered another quarter of double-digit organic sales growth, just as they did throughout 2018, leading to 10% organic sales growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions.","The impact of the spinoffs of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses, both lower margins than the portfolio, contributed 80 basis points of segment margin expansion this quarter. The remaining 40 basis points was a result of our strong operational performance, continued investments in commercial excellence initiatives and increased sales volumes. We continued to effectively manage the impact of tariffs and material and labor inflation through our ongoing mitigation efforts, and we made further progress on the elimination of all spin related stranded costs by the end of 2019. However, we did see some volume declines in our productivity products business which contributed to lower margin in SPS in the quarter. I'll discuss that in more detail shortly.","The majority of our earnings growth, $0.15 this quarter, came from segment profit improvement. We realized the $0.06 benefit from our share repurchase program, which resulted in a weighted average share count of 739 million shares in the quarter. Consistent with our first quarter guidance, our effective tax rate was approximately 22%, which generated $0.04 benefit year-over-year. You will find a bridge of our first quarter earnings per share in the appendix of this presentation.","And finally, adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter was $1.2 billion, up 55%, excluding separation costs and the impact of the spins. As Darius mentioned, we continue to see strong cash generation, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies and aerospace in the quarter. We\u2019re very pleased with our results across the board. Now, let's turn to slide four and discuss our segment performance.","Beginning with Aerospace with sales up 10% on an organic basis, we continued to perform extremely well in today's robust demand environment, driven by our strong positions on the right platforms. Notably, this marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for Aerospace. Defense and space grew 13% organically, led by continued global demand for sensors and guidance systems, increased spares volumes on the U.S. DOD defense programs, and robust shipment volumes on key OE programs, including the F-35.","Commercial OE sales were up 10% organically with increased shipset volumes across all Gulfstream platforms, increased avionics deliveries on the Dassault F900 and F2000 aircraft and increased engine shipments for the Textron Longitude. We expect this momentum to continue in the coming quarters. In the commercial aftermarket, sales were up 8% organically, driven by strong global airlines demand and tailwinds from ADS-B safety mandate. In addition, we saw robust connected aircraft growth, driven by demand for JetWave and business jet software offerings.","Aerospace segment margins expanded by 250 basis points, driven by commercial excellence and margin accretion from the spin of Transportation Systems. The spin contributed about 80 basis points of Aero\u2019s total margin expansion.","Before we move on, I just want to take a moment to address questions we received regarding the unfortunate event surrounding Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. At this time, based on our customer\u2019s current production schedules, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our 2019 results. We will continue to monitor the situation as we move throughout the year.","Now moving to Honeywell Building Technologies. Organic sales growth was 9%, driven by strength in commercial fire products and improved demand for our security offerings. We saw robust demand for our Niagara software platform, as well as further improvement in supply chain execution, which have been impacted in the back half of 2018 by the spins. Project\u2019s growth in building solutions was also strong, particularly for international airport installations in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. The projects backlog in building solutions was up over 15% at the end of the first quarter.","Stepping back for a minute. This quarter's performance is a result of specific actions taken by the new HBT leadership team, which is moving the business in the right direction. The team is building out its sales force and capacity, investing in innovation and they are executing the commercial excellence playbook to deploy and train a high-quality sales team. They\u2019re also focused on improving delivery and execution and are making steady progress to eliminate the remaining stranded costs related to Homes spin. HBT segment margin is expanded 240 basis points in the first quarter, driven by the favorable impact from the spinoff of the Homes business. Overall, we are very pleased with their first quarter and are encouraged for the future.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 5% on an organic basis. Process solutions sales were up 7% organically, driven by broad-based demand in automation, including for our maintenance and migration services, and field instrumentation devices. Orders in HPS grew at a double-digit rate for the third straight quarter, and advanced materials sales were up 4% organically from ongoing demand for flooring products, including for our Solstice line of low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents.","UOP sales were up 1% organically for the quarter, driven by demand in gas processing and hydrogen, particularly -- partially offset by a tough year-over-year sales comparable and licensing and timing related decline in catalyst shipments. We again saw strong orders and backlog growth in UOP up 6% and 8% organically across engineering, equipment and catalysts, which is a positive sign for future sales growth.","PMT segment margins expanded 140 basis points in the first quarter, driven by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes and productivity, including the benefits of previously funded restructuring. This largely offset the impact of material and labor inflation. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 10% on an organic basis. Intelligrated continued to outperform with another strong quarter of double-digit sales growth, driven by the conversion of our major systems backlog, aftermarket services and increased demand for Vocollect voice solutions.","We also saw double-digit sales growth in our sensing and IoT business, which was a continuation of the double-digit growth we achieved in 2018. Our China business also generated double-digit sales growth.","Productivity Solutions sales was partially offset by decreased volumes of scanning and mobility products due to slower project ramp-ups and planned distributor destocking, mostly in North America. We highlighted this potential weakness in the business in early March. We anticipate that the productivity products business will improve in the second half of the year but are planning conservatively in the second quarter, given the decline we experienced in Q1.","Moving to the Safety business. Sales were approximately flat on an organic basis. Growth for gas detection products and retail footwear was offset by softer demand for general safety products and personal protective equipment. SPS segment margins contracted 250 basis points, driven by decreased productivity products, short-cycle volumes, the impact of inflation and unfavorable mix stemming from the significantly higher sales in our warehouse and automation business, which offset benefits from commercial excellence and productivity.","Overall, the trends in our end markets are largely consistent with what we discussed in February. We remained confident in our businesses and our view is supported by strong long-cycle orders and backlog growth. Our focus on smart growth investments, breakthrough initiatives and new product development coupled with continued productivity rigor has positioned us well for the remainder of 2019.","With that let's move to slide five, and we can discuss our second quarter outlook. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that the business environment will be largely similar to Q1 with strength primarily coming from our long-cycle portfolio in commercial aerospace, defense and warehouse automation.","In aerospace, we continue to see robust demand in both commercial aerospace and defense with growth in narrowbody production rates and increased business jet deliveries as several new models have recently entered into service. We expect the commercial aftermarket to continue to be strong driven by flight hours, airlines demand, and further tailwinds from the adoption of safety and compliance mandate. The industry dynamics of defense should continue to be positive, both in the U.S. and abroad.","In Building Technologies, we anticipate continued momentum in commercial fire and security. The second quarter typically encompasses the peak season for demand in these markets. We expect continued conversion of our long-cycle backlog in building solutions and growth in services. In PMT orders and backlog growth in UOP and in the automation businesses and process solutions should drive another quarter of strong sales growth in Q2.","In HPS, we expect continued short-cycle demand in maintenance and migration services, and field instrumentation devices. In UOP growth, driven by licensing, engineering and gas processing demand while in advanced materials, we expect to see continued adoption of Solstice products in refrigerants in foam applications.","Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect the strong e-commerce and warehouse distribution macro trends to continue, as well as growth in maintenance, services and voice solutions. We're expecting additional destocking in our distributor channel will drive a decline in mobility, scanning and print in the quarter. On the safety side, growth should improve sequentially in both gas detection and personal protective equipment, and we anticipate continued demand in the retail footwear business.","For total Honeywell, the net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax will be approximately a positive $30 million to $40 million next quarter, driven by increased interest income and benefit from the spins\u2019 indemnification payments related to asbestos environmental expenses, partially offset by lower pension income due to 2018 pension derisking actions we took, all as previously guided. Our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of 734 million shares and effective tax rate of about 22% and earnings dilution from the 2018 spin of approximately $0.19 in the quarter.","Now, let's turn to slide six and we can discuss our revised full year guidance. We have revised our full year sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect our strong outperformance in the first quarter. We continue to be encouraged by our business performance and outlook. However, we are remaining cautious with regards to the short-cycle portion of our portfolio, given the macro uncertainties that remain in the second half of the year. We are raising our full-year organic sales guide by 1 point on both the low and the high end to a new range of 3% to 6%. Our segment margin expansion and free cash flow guides are unchanged. We remain on track to deliver 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion while investing in the business through high return CapEx and research and development.","The revised earnings per guidance represents earnings growth of 7% to 10% excluding the impact of the spins in 2018. We continue to expect no significant impact in 2019 related to tariffs. We have mitigation actions in place including to address the impact of potential tariffs and all remaining items imported from China. We are also closely monitoring the potential effects of Brexit on our operations and are communicating regularly with our customers, partners and suppliers around these plans. We are planning for various potential Brexit outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit scenario to ensure that as the terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU are finalized, we are best positioned to continue meeting our customers' needs.","Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share count of approximately 731 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Our net below the line expenses are now expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million of net expense in 2019, slightly down from original estimate of $80 million in net expense. The minor change is due to slightly higher full-year estimates for both pension and interest income.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Darius who will wrap up on slide seven.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Greg. The first quarter was an outstanding start to 2019 for Honeywell. We continued to execute on our commitments to shareowners and accelerate organic growth from last quarter. We have winning positions in attractive end markets with multiple levers to deliver continued margin expansion. Our operational performance is driving adjusted free cash growth and conversion. All of this combined with innovative new product offerings, and a strong backlog positions us well for the second quarter.","We\u2019re continuing the business transformation initiatives I outlined during our outlook call, including in Honeywell Digital, a unified software business in Honeywell Connected Enterprise and the increased focus on improving our supply chain execution. You will hear more about this and other exciting things happening in Honeywell at our 2019 annual investor conference, which will take place on May 14th.","With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Darius. Both Darius and Greg are now available to answer any questions. April, if you could, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Greg Lewis","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","So, just kind of doing the -- lot of companies betting on kind of back half acceleration, you guys are just mechanically the opposite and just doing the normal seasonality analysis around the businesses. Is there anything specifically that worries you in the second half because I'm getting to obviously something that's a lot higher, based on just basic normal seasonal analysis on both organic as well as the EPS numbers, and obviously this wasn't a perfect quarter, given PMT and UOP, which seemingly with the backlog, should bounce back nicely, and maybe have a bit of a slowing in other businesses, I don't know. Just curious if there's anything that stands out that you're concerned about in the second half of the year?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I guess I\u2019ll start. I don't know that there is anything that really concerns me in the second half of the year. I think what's an unknown in the second half of the year is short-cycle business, that's sort of the big unknown. And I think the signals are mixed. I think, overall, we were pleased with our outcome in Q1, but this short-cycle business is very much that short-cycle and all of those things looked good in Q1. They can look very, very different in the second half. On PMT, I don't know, Steve. I'm pretty happy with the PMT outcome for Q1. Whether you look at bookings, revenues, margin expansion, I'm not sure I'm really disappointed with those results at all. I am actually very, very pleased. Then when you think about things like HPS projects up strong double digits, backlog up, out book-to-bill up 1.2 in the long cycle business. I don't know that I can -- that there is much to be disappointed about there.","Steve Tusa","Yes. I guess my only point was on UOP. It was flattish this quarter and it should accelerate. There are reasons for it to accelerate. So, I am saying that's not a reason for it to be -- for revenues to be weaker in the second half of the year. Okay. That makes some sense. Just lastly on -- to nitpick here on SPS, what is going on with the productivity business? I mean the tone at ProMat sounded reasonably positive. Is there anything going on with the launch of Mobility Edge that's moving around a little bit? Just curious, little more color on the SPS business because that was a little bit weaker than we were expecting.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think that's fair. Yes. I think, couple of things. The first one being, we had some destocking in our distributor -- at our distributors. We anticipated some of that. Frankly, it was a little bit greater than we had anticipated and we think that that's actually going to continue in Q2. When you look at the product sub-segments, actually the mobility did okay. As we look at the sell-through figures for productivity products, the mobility did quite well. It was probably more of an issue on the destocking on the scanning and that's where we saw a little bit of the pain points. But I will tell you that in the second half of the year, we are anticipating growth in that business. We anticipate filling some larger orders and the destocking situation should normalize. So, yes, this Q1 wasn't exactly what we had hoped for, but I'm also bullish on the long term of the business.","Steve Tusa","Sorry. One more quick one. Have your priorities on capital allocation changed at all? Are you guys -- given where multiples are today, are you thinking maybe a little more buyback than acquisitions. Are you still on the hunt with this pipeline?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. No, I think, it's just -- unfortunately environment hasn't changed. We would like to steer more of our deployment toward M&A, but I'm also trying to stay disciplined and the multiples continue to be high. So something is going to have to give, but having said that, we have been deploying more toward buybacks and we deployed a lot last year. Average share purchase price was right around $150, and that includes -- that's prior to the spin-off of Garrett and Resideo. So if you look at where we are today, I think, that's proven to be a pretty good investment. And we continued with another $750 million in Q1, which also it looks to be -- and I think when in doubt, bet on yourself, because there's -- we feel great about the Company, we feel great about our prospects, we're going to continue to perform as indicated by our backlog positions, our bookings and so on. We're very confident Honeywell is going to continue to perform and thus a little bit more skewed toward buyback, but don't read into that that we're not interested in M&A. We're just trying to be disciplined and pay good valuations that are reasonable which is extraordinarily challenging in this environment and you see the multiple being paid.","Steve Tusa","Yes. When you're beating and raising and growing 6% to 8% you can be patient. So I get it. Thanks a lot.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just two things from me. First, just back on channel inventories, maybe more broadly, is there anything that stands out in your businesses, especially in the shorter cycle businesses, where there was some type of pre-buy or something that's created elevated inventory that you're planning for some give back on beyond what we've seen in productivity solutions? Maybe just a general state of play there and your visibility to the extent that there is any on the short-cycle.","Darius Adamczyk","No, there was a little bit in terms of n ERP pre-buy, because we had done some ERP conversions. And as you know, sometimes they don't go as smoothly as planned. So we generally had a little bit of a buy-in, but I don't think that was accelerated. I think there was a little bit of a mismatch between sell-out expectations and buy-in expectations, and it was particularly pronounced in productivity, especially in our scanning business. And those things just take a little bit time to normalize. And we are very confident in that portfolio. We've got a new set of products coming out here again, particularly in the warehouse and distribution segment, which we think is very interesting. So, I'm not particularly worried about it. And like I said, we are projecting growth for the second half, but there isn't sort of something systematic here that's concerning. And a lot of our HBT portfolio is also short-cycle, and you saw the kind of figures we posted there and I was extremely pleased with the organic growth that we saw in HBT, which is also primarily a short-cycle businesses as well, other than HBT -- yes, as projects [come up] [ph].","Jeffrey Sprague","And then, secondly, unrelated, just on the project related work in general, in process and where it may spill into gas processing in UOP, just what is the nature of the activity you're seeing? Does any particular sub vertical jump out, meaning refining or LNG or the like? And just any color there on forward pipeline would be interesting.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean I think the LNG segment is continuing to be active and we are waiting with some final investment decisions to be upcoming, but whether it's UOP business which participates there as well as HPS, it's continued to be a very active segment. Our gas processing business and although this kind of -- this price of oil makes the unconventional segment appealing, there's also a greater level of discipline by a lot of that unconventional players in terms of cash generation, which there used to be a bit more build out the infrastructure, drill and so on. Now they want to be self-sustaining in terms of their cash flow. So the environment is good, but it's also little bit more disciplined. But anytime you see this kind of depreciation in the price of oil, we feel pretty good about the entire PMT segment. Refining with the clean fuel segment, that also continues to be an opportunity, particularly in segments like Latin America, then of course, clean fuels for shipping as well. So sort of broad-based strength and whenever you get to this kind of an oil price, we feel very confident in the outlook for PMT.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","There is not much to pick on in this quarter for sure. Are you guys surprised that -- just the pace of how strong things were? I mean China was supposed to be a little slower, Europe was supposed to be a little bit slower. It doesn't seem like that happened at all to you guys though. Can you give some color, maybe Darius, around the world what you saw?","Greg Lewis","Yes. Scott, this is Greg. I mean, I think we were pretty pleased with what we saw across the globe as you mentioned. The US, obviously, a large part of our growth was up double digits. Europe continue to be good for us, I'd say, mid-single digits, as well. Middle East, very strong, up strong double digits in virtually every business. China for us was down slightly, but that was really not structural in nature. We've had some very large wins in UOP that we're burning off some backlog on. So the remainder of the businesses were up double digits in both HBT and SPS for example in China, PMT down a bit. We expect that to turn positive. And I think we've guided low single-digits in China for the year in the last call and I still think that's probably about right for us. India was a very strong story for us, again, across all businesses, up double digits. So I think on balance, we had a very good performance. Obviously, the 8% total top line, better than we had anticipated, with all of those cylinders firing in the same direction at once.","Darius Adamczyk","Just to add to that, maybe is, I just would highlight the HBT performance. I mean, I think we're starting to see the seeds of better performance in HBT, and when you are close to 9% number, I think that makes us feel good. We've got some more NPD coming, particularly even more so in the second half of the year than the first. So I'm very optimistic in terms of what we're seeing in that business. And overall, the environment is good. I mean I think the market didn't quite get this right in December. I think that December was doom and gloom and recession is here and as you can see by our results in Q1 and as Greg pointed out, we see strength across the globe. We didn't have a market that really stood out to us, and said okay, that's a train wreck. I mean, everything was either up or up a lot. So, overall, we're pleased with what we're seeing so far.","Greg Lewis","The only thing I would mention too is, back to the second half and our views there is, some of the macro risks, let's say, they're not gone. They just got pushed to the right, Brexit is an example, the US-China trade situation. So things that we thought might have perhaps come to a conclusion in Q1 just haven't and have pushed to the right and I think that's also helped from a market sentiment perspective.","Scott Davis","Good color. Just switching gears a little bit, the connected enterprise initiative, how much of a headwind is that on margins right now or is that turned into more of a neutral?","Darius Adamczyk","No. That's actually accretive to what we do and by the way that grew in the teens again, so that\u2026","Scott Davis","I'm sorry, I meant the ERP, your ERP rollout, not your growth initiative.","Greg Lewis","Sorry. ERP rollouts, we're in very good shape. Yes. I mean we continue to move down the path. We talked about the fact that we were at 148. I think we finished at -- in 2016, we finished at 71, and we're probably going to take out another 20, or so this year on our path to getting down to 10 core platforms by 2021. And we continue to make good progress there. Lots of -- as you can imagine, lots of integrated planning going on to make sure that there is business readiness. We've got obviously all the IT readiness there, but we've got to always manage the change that goes along with the combination of ERP moves and business requirements. But feel very good where we are, it's not been disruptive and I think we've got a good solid plan to make sure that we don't put too much in any one quarter or in any one business to add business risk.","Scott Davis","Okay. But it still is a mathematically headwind, though, is that correct Greg.","Greg Lewis","When you say mathematically a headwind, what you mean?","Scott Davis","Just on the payback. I mean are you at the point yet where the payback is greater than what your dollar output is?","Greg Lewis","Yes. I mean, from a savings and a cost out perspective, we are now at a place where our run rate cost savings has certainly ramped up, where 93% of our revenues are on our core 10 platforms. So we have hit the majority of the scale, that I would say, that we're going to get from a cost productivity perspective and most of the things that were remaining on the roadmap are cleaning up more of the smaller items.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think if you were to look at this, Scott, on a year-over-year basis, the impact is, I would say, very, very slightly accretive, but negligibly so.","Greg Lewis","Yes. I mean the run rate of deployment costs that we've got in the P&L is roughly flat year-on-year and each year, we're obviously adding some run rate benefits to the P&L overall.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","In terms of margin expansion guidance for the full year, aero and HBT are tracking well ahead of that, PMT is at the high end of the range. How do we think about continued runway from here in margin expansion? And maybe as my follow-up on SPS, I understand margin mix pressure and maybe a little bit of inflation, how does that play out throughout the rest of 2019? Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Yes. So, Sheila, our guidance for the year remains at 30 basis points to 60 basis points, I believe, at this point. We've talked about that being our framework and what we continue to do is add initiatives and elements to be able to continue having that runway in front of us. And so, with things like our connected enterprise growth, which is margin accretive from a software business perspective, with our digital transformation efforts, Scott, just mentioned, things like the productivity around the ERP deployments, as well as just our HOS Gold playbook, that's driving commercial excellence into each of the businesses, and then, again, our continual repositioning pipeline, we see that 30 basis points to 50 basis points framework, that we've laid out, as very much sustainable over the coming years. So on a portfolio basis, we feel very good about where we are in that regard.","Now, as we mentioned, with this year, we're always talking about the elimination of stranded costs. We continue to see some of that impact in the first part of this year and that will dissipate. We've talked about having those stranded costs eliminated by the time we get to the end of 2019, and that will be fully behind us. So, broadly speaking, feel very good about the margin expansion potential. It is a portfolio. In different quarters and years, some business will have more or less opportunity depending on where they are in particular. And then, as it relates to SPS, and the mix component, with very high growth in the Intelligrated business as -- when we bought it, it started out below the line average for margins, and we continue to improve that as we've integrated that business, but it is still below the line average for the rest of the segment. And so as we get through the destocking in productivity products and we normalize, let's say, to perhaps growth rates that aren't multiples of double digits per quarter in Intelligrated, we expect to see that SPS margin rate continue to improve throughout the year.","Darius Adamczyk","I think maybe just to add a couple of things. The framework has changed a little bit, what you're seeing is, you're seeing a much strong organic growth rate and a margin rate increase, still, that's very much, what we've committed long-term to our investors, which is the 30% to 50%. We are like smack right in the middle of that, but at a rate -- at a growth rate that's substantially higher. But if you're concerned about sort of our continued focus on margin, there is no need to be concerned there, because we have plenty of levers, even just from purely a productivity perspective, whether we think about ERP discussions we had before, the simplification in our ISC performance and overall making that much more simple, direct material productivity, we think we have more room for improvement there as well. We're going to continue to find the restructuring, just like we did this quarter and we anticipate doing more of that in the second half of the year, as well as Q2.","And then we still have some stranded costs to go to take out, both in HBT, as well as corporate. So we have a lot of room in terms of productivity. We were hurt a little bit in Q1 because our Intelligrated business is growing -- when I say strong double digits, I mean think really strong double digits and that's not helping the mix. But overall, we're not going to step back from something just because it's lower margin, when you can run it with negative cash flow, as well as that kind of an expansion, which will ultimately turn to a higher margin business once we establish an install base.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","I know Greg touched on this in the prepared remarks on those 737 MAX and I also know you guys don't disclose any of the dollar on the ship sets, but just could you share with us what's on the platform and maybe what your assumptions are and how this plays out, where it does not impact your 2019 guidance?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I think our assumption is exactly what Boeing laid out, which is their reduction in the production rates. We've encompassed that. We've numerous systems on the plane. We do expect that the delivery of these planes and their production rate to resume at the second half of this year. But as Greg pointed out, the impact for us is negligible, certainly for Q2, and I think, given that most -- just about everybody expects a resolution, we do too, we think that that's a terrific aircraft that's going to be back up and flying in the second half of the year. So I think there's really nothing more to add than that.","Deane Dray","And then, one of the soft spots in the fourth quarter was the whole China air and water dynamic for HBT, didn't sound like that carried into this quarter, but if you could update us there, has that normalized and what are you assuming for 2019?","Darius Adamczyk","No. Actually, air and water, to be honest, didn't have a great quarter in Q1, but overall HBT did. So, what's even more impressive about their performance is in spite challenged performance in air and water, HBT still grew 9%. So, I'm actually not discouraged by that, I'm very encouraged by that. But overall, I would say, the air and water segment is inconsequential in terms of overall annual performance. And -- but it was a headwind to HBT in Q1 and they still grew 9%. So I view that as a very positive outcome.","Deane Dray","Good to hear. Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe, a first question around the margin profile at HBT. I think you'd called out what the ex-spins margin performance was year-on-year in aerospace. Maybe just give that number in HBT, as well in Q1? And apologies, if I had missed that. And then, also, when you are looking forward for HBT, given the fairly high building solutions weighting in the sales mix, how do you think about incremental margins for HBT overall and managing that solutions mix moving around?","Greg Lewis","So, yes, in terms of HBT, margins actually were down ex the spins in the quarter, about 100 basis points, and as we talked about, the stranded costs are still an impact to them. When you think about our stranded costs overall, It was about 60-40 between corp and the businesses. So, HBT is still digging out of a little bit of the stranded costs hold, particularly in some of the factory aspects that they have there. So, that we again expect to remediate over the course of the remaining quarters. And then, in terms of the mix of products versus projects, certainly just like we have in our other businesses, it's no different than in PMT and even as we are talking about, with SPS, we do the projects business, is a meaningful part of HBT, and carries a lower profile than the product side as well. So we're always going to be managing through the mix of that overall, but we see -- where we landed for the quarter, I think, we were around 20 points of margin for HBT overall and we do see that progressing throughout the year.","Julian Mitchell","And then just circling back on the overall top line, I was intrigued on the guidance. You took up the high end of the organic sales growth guide. So just wanted to understand why the low end --","Greg Lewis","We took up a point on the high end and then a point on the low end.","Julian Mitchell","Yes. So I understand that the low end would go up because you have a very good Q1 print now in the bag. But taking up the high-end that would imply no slowdown year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. Just wondered if there are any specific end markets or businesses that drove that increase at the high end?","Darius Adamczyk","I would say, it's our long cycle businesses. So whether we talk about PMT, we talk about the segments of aerospace, HBT, we had a very strong booking quarter and our book-to-bill was 1.2, which was also very helpful. So what we're -- what gave us the confidence for the rest of the year in raising the guidance was the long cycle bookings. Short-cycle, I still will say, is unpredictable. I mean, I think our visibility there is relatively unknown, especially for the second half. And I think there is a little bit of caution that we still have in terms of our second half outlook on short-cycle. We'll see how that evolves. I think you'll see some of the other commentary by some of our competitors and so on, and we're not seeing it in terms of the challenges, but that doesn't mean that they can't and won't exist, but based on what we're seeing in the business, we remain relatively bullish and that's what gave us the confidence in raising the bottom end and the top.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","So, I guess maybe starting with UOP, if we could go through the outlook over the rest of the year, backlog up 8%. I know you guys have some tough catalyst comps that you're facing, that's what drove the 1Q. I guess, slight weakness versus backlog growth. If you could talk about when we should expect UOP organic growth to accelerate?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, we expected in the second half of the year. I mean, I think what's important to point out is, we had some very challenging year-over-year comps, especially with our China bookings and revenue conversion that was what drove that. But UOP had a very good orders growth; I mean mid-single digit kind of orders growth. So there is nothing to me in UOP that's screaming a problem. Yes. I mean the year-over-year revenue growth was a little bit flattish, but again driven more a little bit by tough comps and timing. But the number that I always look at for those long cycle businesses is orders and that's mid-single digit, with a strong pipeline and this is not an area of worry for me.","Nicole DeBlase","And maybe a second question around SPS organic growth outlook. So I know the Intelligrated comps are becoming pretty difficult and I think they get difficult throughout the year, if I'm correct. Correct me if I'm wrong. How do we balance that against potential improvement in productivity solutions as we get through this destocking? Like should we think of the high-single digit growth as potentially sustainable within SPS so long as the short-cycle trends behave?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think you captured it exactly correctly. I think, Intelligrated is going to have tougher and tougher comps as we get deeper into the year, in Q2, Q3 and Q4. I mean, I can only dream that they have another quarter like Q1, but that's probably not completely realistic. So their growth on a year-over-year basis is going to be slower, but it's going to be there. But that should get offset by some of the other segments of the SPS portfolio, particularly in the second half, namely productivity products and industrial safety. So, we think that that will balance out and we're going to continue to see a rate of growth in SPS, which is, I think, mid-to-upper single digits for the year. So that's our expectation right now based on what we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Darius, 8% commercial aviation organic aftermarket growth is the fastest growth we've seen from Honeywell in this cycle. We know aftermarket growth has been a particular focus of the aero team. But where has that improvement versus global flight hours come from? You did mention safety mandates are helping, but is it the uptick in performance-based contracting and increasing growth from connected aero is also helping and so would you agree that the trends toward continuing improved aftermarket growth for Honeywell looks sustainable moving forward?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, I think you've captured a couple of the big levers, where the growth is coming from, because we're moving away from just fixed rate kind of our aftermarket growth. That's certainly a good part of it, but the other part of it is, what I call the proactive aftermarket growth, which is much more around connected aircraft, around RMUs, which generate a lot of value for our customers. As you know, we made a substantial investment in the aftermarket, primarily in the aftermarket sales team, I think, going back two to two and a half years ago, and we've added now almost 250 sales professionals focused on driving proactive aftermarket sales. And you are seeing the benefits of that coming through. So it's both an effort in terms of generating proactive and investing in R&D to generate these RMUs, which our sales professionals sell, and then, obviously accelerated growth in our connected aircraft platform. Those are the two big drivers and I don't see any reason why that isn't sustainable.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And Darius, maybe just staying on aero for a second, could you give us some more color on your commentary regarding commercial excellence driving margin improvement. Where are you in terms of alleviating supplier constraints within aero? How much more room is there within aero to take G&A and fixed costs in general out and should we be thinking that margin for the year could be a fair amount higher than -- I think you had guided to 24% last quarter for the year?","Greg Lewis","Sure. Maybe let me try that one on. When you think about our commercial excellence efforts, I would think about that less as a cost reduction effort because what we're trying to do is, enable our sales teams to be more effective, ensure that we're deploying and redeploying sales resources into the right spots. And actually we're investing in things like training to be able to make these sales associates more effective in the markets that they're in, with the products and solutions that they're selling. So we think about commercial excellence less as a, I'm trying to take cost out and more about, I'm trying to drive seller productivity and growth. So I don't know, Darius, if you would add to that.","Darius Adamczyk","I think I'd agree with that. But as always, we always balance everything with growth in commercial levers and productivity levers. And we put some money to work for restructuring pipeline in aero last year and we're going to continue to do that but. But yes, when we say, commercial excellence, we really mean driving productivity and outcomes growth on the front end of the business.","Andrew Kaplowitz","I think, Greg, it's fair to say that that 24% guide looks conservative now after a strong start?","Greg Lewis","I am sorry. The what?","Andrew Kaplowitz","The 24% guide for the year looks conservative after a strong start to the year in aero?","Greg Lewis","Listen, I think we feel good about the place aerospace is in terms of their margin expansion potential and that's an area that gives us a lot of confidence for our overall guidance range for the Company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","I'm sorry. Hi. Having a bit of problem here with my phone, sort of hit the mute button. Sorry about that. Good morning. So, covered a lot of ground here already. HBT, the acceleration there is obviously a big break in the trends. And I'm just curious given that the separation of Resideo was -- that was a carve out from the business, do you think that the distraction around that was a factor why sales last year were a little bit weaker, and now we've seen that strength? And then, maybe just address China, because China is obviously where we've seen lot of stimulus, where we've seen some improvement in the product now over there, how important is China acceleration in the HBT performance?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Couple of factors, and the management distraction. There's no doubt that the Resideo was a heavy lift last year for the HBT team. I mean that the amount of separation work that had to be done to create Resideo, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis Garrett, is incredible. So I think that that team has did an outstanding job in enabling Resideo to exist and I continue to be very impressed by what they have done. Now, I wouldn't say -- was it a distraction? Yes. It take their eye off the ball on growth? I don't think so. But they certainly have more time to do that this year when they can be very focused on the markets, on what's happening and that team has done a great job and continue to move that business forward. So I'm very pleased. Yes. I mean, China is important for our entire business, not just HBT. We've been there a long time, we want to be a local player. We are local player. As I've talked about multiple times on this call, which is, we very strongly believe in local strategies, where we innovate, where we come up with ideas, where we manufacture, market and sell all in the markets that we participate in and that's certainly true in China. And I think that team has -- the China team in HBT has done a nice job in creating that kind of an offering, so -- with more upside for the future. So overall, I'm not going to declare any victories after one quarter in HBT, but I certainly loved what I saw in Q1 and I'm bullish on the future.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Thanks, Darius. And quick follow on safety, that the flat performance and safety, sounds like it's mainly channel inventories. But we have heard one or two other players talking about some weakness in safety. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in there and how that results?","Darius Adamczyk","I would characterize it a lot more as sort of a channel issue rather than anything else. And as we pointed out, that's something we need to -- that should alleviate in the first half of the year, and then we should be back at the right place by the second half of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Hi. Just curious if anybody is going to top your organic growth this quarter. Let's see what happens there. Question on software growth. Can you guys -- I mean you alluded to that, but can you just talk about the growth for embedded and stand-alone software and what would stand-alone software business be in 2019 versus 2018?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, as usual, we are expecting high teens to 20% growth in our software business. That target has not changed. We grew in the teens in Q1. So, I think we're very much on track. We kind of called the connected enterprise as really transforming and we are going to be doing some fun things at Investor Day. So, I don't want to give too much away and the day after in terms of new launch. For those of you that went to Hanover, you probably saw a little bit of a hint of that in terms of Honeywell Forge. But I'm excited by what's going on with that team and what they're trying to do. The embedded platform is growing nicely as well. I think mid to high single-digit growth there as well in lot of those platforms. So, overall, it's been an area of emphasis for Honeywell, it's going to continue to be and we're seeing the results in our P&L.","Andrew Obin","Do you want to talk a little bit about Honeywell Forge ahead of the Analyst Day?","Darius Adamczyk","No. I can't steal all the thunder. I've got to have something to talk about in May and you are going to have to wait a little bit.","Andrew Obin","Let me ask a follow-up question on 737 MAX, do you think there will be any working capital impact, just do you think Boeing will behave any differently in terms of managing payments to you during this production ramp down? Should we expect any change in seasonality in aerospace?","Darius Adamczyk","No. We are not really expecting that. I mean I think we're trying to be as helpful to Boeing and to NTSB as we can to get this thing resolved, but no, I think, from our financial or payment, I don't anticipate that will be the case. And I am confident that Boeing is going to get this issue resolved and we are their biggest fans and we're ready to help in any way we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just first question on UOP. I think a few folks have taken a stab at it here, but Darius, you mentioned some good momentum on the LNG side. I think one of your competitors has talked about maybe a mid-year order surge. So I guess the question is, despite the good order growth you've seen, are we still on the leading edge of some of those investments?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, I don't think we need to wait till midyear. I can tell you without getting precise on the numbers that the growth in our orders in our projects business, in HPS specifically, was, let's just call it, a strong double-digit growth. So I don't think we need to wait till Q2 or Q3. We've already seen it and the pipeline remains strong. And yes, whether it's LNG -- and it's more than LNG because it's broad based, but we are very pleased with the kind of orders we've already booked much less what's maybe in the pipeline.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And does that start to hit in the second half? I guess, it doesn't really look like there's much in 2Q just examining guidance.","Darius Adamczyk","You mean in terms of orders or in terms of --","Greg Lewis","You are talking in terms of actually those orders turning into revenue?","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yes.","Greg Lewis","Again, as you know those things always have a timeframe to them. So they will probably play out over the back half of the year.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. When you think about HPS orders, most of those don't get executed for a course of 18 months to 24 months and sometimes even longer. So there isn't a very fast conversion from orders to revenue. In some case, that can take several quarters.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just shifting over to some of your short-cycle comments, I think line up with what you said last quarter Darius, but thinking about some of the intra-segment comments, it seems like SPS, there's good momentum, maybe more of a destock, so things can improve from there. HBT, has a good amount of momentum you mentioned in second half, product launches that could augment that further. I guess where specifically do you see that lack of short-cycle visibility or a particular apprehension, because it looks like in a lot of the exposures there is reasons to be maybe a bit more optimistic not more cautious?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, maybe I mean I don't know that I would necessarily argue with you. But actually on the short-cycle, when you get into beyond three months, which is really kind of what we're talking about for the second half, I think, pretty confident in our Q2, I'm not confident that I really can give you great visibility on short-cycle beyond three months. I mean there is nothing that I'm seeing that worries me. You shouldn't read into that that there is some issue that we're trying to cover or protect ourselves. I think it's just a reflection of -- there's a lot of unknowns. And as I stated before on this call, we're seeing some of the commentary by some of our competitors, some of them have even reported and what we're wondering is, are we unique or is there something else that's going on in the market here that maybe hasn't hit us yet. But I don't see that. I think we're very bullish on what's happening. But again, it's just a reflection of the level of uncertainty, because I know from my past, the short-cycle can turn extraordinarily quickly and one quarter can actually be a long time.","Greg Lewis","Yes. Again, I just would say on the macros, I think we all would agree that a hard Brexit is going to have some impact, and yes, we had anticipated that that might happen at the end of March, as did the rest of the world, and now that's moved to potentially October. So that's just now pushed that worry down six months into the year. And again, I'd just same -- I mentioned it earlier, but saber rattling between the EU and the US on tariffs and the lack of a done deal with the US and China just keeps the cloud hanging over to see what's going to happen. So to Darius's point, it's not that we see something very specific that we know is coming, but there hasn't been this many macro uncertainties in the environment, certainly that I can recall.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi. And thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one question around price, it looks like, you know in the Q, and this could be some rounding, you're still in that 2% zip code. I might have thought that would have ticked up a little bit, maybe it's rounding, but can you just talk about your ability to capture price? And obviously, I know within the context of tariffs and Brexit, there are other mitigating actions in there besides price, but maybe if we could just kind of isolate on price for a little bit?","Greg Lewis","Well, again, I would say we feel very good about our pricing program and we've talked about it before that, particularly given the value our offerings generate, we feel like we're in a good position from a price standpoint. As you mentioned, tariff impacts we've been able to mitigate and some of that is through pass them through in pricing, which by the way, keep in mind that's dilutive to our margin expansion. You pass through a $1 of price and have a $1 of inflation that actually dilutes your margin rate. So, I wouldn't say that there is anything concerning at all as we sit here about our effectiveness in passing through price at this stage.","Darius Adamczyk","And I would just add that, to us pricing is a function of really NPD and bringing valuable things to customers. So we don't really like to talk about price, as much we'd like to talk about value. And I think what you should expect is, as our NPD cycle shortens, which we've launched a whole new innovation process called Z21, which basically will reduce our innovation cycle time in half and the ratio of our revenues coming from new products will increase. That has obviously greater opportunities for value capture. So, that's really sort of related to your question. And that innovation cycle is accelerating and will do so not just this year but for many years to come.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Darius Adamczyk, for any additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Honeywell started 2019 with significant momentum, including strong organic sales and superb earnings and cash flow growth.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are our Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek; and Vice President of Corporate Finance, Greg Lewis.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","For this call, references to earnings per share, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude impacts from separation costs related to the planned spinoff of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses as well as the recent tax legislation except where otherwise noted. ","This morning, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the third quarter and provide an update to our 2018 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell delivered another outstanding quarter of earnings per share of $2.12, up 18% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Using our effective tax rate guidance for the quarter of 24%, earnings per share was $2.06 or $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. Tom will take you through these details momentarily.","Our earnings this quarter were driven by organic sales growth of 6%. The sales growth was strong across the portfolio with double-digit growth in the Aerospace defense business and the SPS warehouse automation business. We expect the sales momentum to continue throughout the second half of the year as our long-cycle orders were up 11% and our long-cycle backlog was up 14% with noteworthy backlog strength in Intelligrated, defense, business aviation, UOP and HPS services. I will touch on our revised full year guidance in a minute.","We expanded segment margin by 60 basis points, which also exceeded our guide. Strong operational performance drove our exceptional margin result, and we benefited from higher volumes, continued investments in commercial excellence and mature productivity. We achieved these results while investing in our future, particularly in connected enterprises, research and development and in our global sales force. So far, we've also overcome the impacts of inflation. Greg will cover that in more detail later in the call.","Free cash flow was again a highlight this quarter at about $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, excluding separation costs. Conversion this quarter was 108%, the highest second quarter conversion we've had in 5 years. This continuous the improving trends we saw in the first quarter as our HOS Gold working capital tool set continues to deliver results. ","Finally, we continued to aggressively deploy capital, repurchasing about $800 million in Honeywell shares. In total, in the first half, we repurchased about $1.7 billion in Honeywell shares as we continue to take advantage of our opportunities in the marketplace to be more aggressive from a capital deployment perspective. ","We're also tracking well against the cash repatriation plan we reviewed at our Investor Day in February, which contemplated more than $4 billion of cash being repatriated in 2018. We brought back nearly $2.2 billion into the U.S. through the second quarter.","Today, we are raising our full year 2018 organic sales growth guidance to a new range of up to 5% to 6%, our segment margin expansion to 40 to 60 basis points, our EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.15 or up 13% to 15% and our full year free cash flow guidance to $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion. Compared to prior range, our EPS guidance is now $0.20 higher at the low end and $0.10 higher at the high end. These changes reflect both our second quarter performance and our confidence in the company's ability to continue outperforming for the remainder of the year.","Our end markets are strong. We're executing well, as evidenced by our margin and cash performance, and we have significant balance sheet capacity still to deploy. I'm encouraged by our performance to date and expect more of the same in the second half.","Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent exciting news in our businesses. ","In Aerospace, Dassault Aviation launched FalconConnect, a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate use, management of -- and control of in-flight connectivity. FalconConnect is powered by Honeywell's routers, services ground infrastructure and GoDirect connectivity services and is designed to make connectivity as efficient as possible for operators, crews and passengers. It includes both classic and high-speed cabin Internet, cockpit safety links, standard ground communications and a wide range of value-added services designed to maximize data control and minimize costs. FalconConnect is available on all Dassault Falcon jets, making Honeywell GoDirect the preferred service provider for operators flying Falcons. ","Last month, Honeywell released a comprehensive study about the connected aircraft, which found that the commercial aviation industry is at the beginning of a 5-year technology investment wave fueled by the advances in high-speed in-flight WiFi connectivity. The study found that about half of the respondents expect to spend up to $1 million per aircraft on connectivity technologies over the next year and 17% of respondents expect to spend more than $10 million per aircraft over the next 5 years. Honeywell is at the forefront of innovation when it comes to connected aircraft, and we are well positioned to continue to win in this fast-growing space.","In Home and Building Technologies, the building owner of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest structure, is currently piling a Honeywell connected building outcome-based service, which uses building performance data to focus maintenance activities where they are most needed in order to improve operational efficiency, maximize uptime and improve the integrity of the security systems. So far, the pilot, which encompassed the mechanical components of the Burj Khalifa's HVAC system, has resulted in a 40% reduction in total maintenance hours and a significant reduction in unplanned reactive maintenance, helping the building operators lower their maintenance cost for this landmark facility in Dubai.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, ExxonMobil announced that the Honeywell Process Solutions' Experion LCN software approach to migrate their legacy installed base DCS systems eliminates the need for costly rip and replace DCS migrations. Experion LCN enables infinite longevity of our customers' DCS systems by preserving their intellectual property. ExxonMobil indicated that Honeywell exceeded their expectations, met their challenge 2 years ahead of the schedule and gave Honeywell and A on the development of this unique and cost-effective offering. The comments were made at Honeywell Users Conference Group, or HUG, which took place in San Antonio last month. The event brings together more than 1,300 customers, channel partners, suppliers and other industry participants from 32 countries to discuss the latest technology and innovations in the process automation space.","Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell Intelligrated provided the material handling equipment design, installation and support for Amazon's new more than 0.5 million square foot distribution center north of Calgary. Once it opens later this year, the facility will complement a larger network of Amazon fulfillment centers throughout Canada. ","The Intelligrated system includes more than 4,800 linear meters of conveyor, an IntelliSort high-speed slide and shoe routing sorter, which achieves the highest speeds of any piece of equipment in the facility while maintaining the precision to handle even fragile items and an even bigger IntelliSort cross-belt shipping sorter that stretches 529 meters in length. This system helps workers efficiently pick, pack and ship orders so they arrive on the customer's doorsteps on time. ","Our connected offerings are transforming the industries in which we participate, leveraging our large installed base to help our customers gain a competitive advantage in the markets they serve.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our second quarter results in more detail.","Thomas Szlosek","Well, thank you, Darius. Good morning. Let me begin on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we delivered another quarter that was strong across the portfolio and in every financial metric. Organic growth was widespread, with about 70% of the portfolio growing organically 5% or more in the quarter and about 2\/3 of our organic growth coming from increased volumes. The markets we serve are strong, and our continued organic sales growth reflects our leading market positions and the investments we've made in new products and in our sales organization. ","The difference between reported and organic sales is primarily the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar in the first half compared to 2017. For example, the euro averaged about $1.20 in the second quarter of '18 versus about $1.10 in 2017.","Segment profit was up 12% in the quarter, and segment margin expanded by 60 basis points to 19.6%, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales volumes, commercial excellence and material productivity. Earnings per share of $2.12, up 18%, and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.09. This excludes spin-related separation costs of $346 million in the quarter. We'll walk through the details of the EPS shortly.","Free cash flow in the second quarter of $1.7 billion, up 42%, driven by strong operational performance, particularly in Aerospace and PMT. As Darius mentioned, we continue to be encouraged by the progress on our working capital initiatives and by the additional opportunities that we've discovered through this effort. ","We continue to deploy capital and in the quarter, repurchased about $800 million of Honeywell shares, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to about $1.7 billion. After growth investments and paying a competitive dividend, our preference is to deploy capital to M&A. But in the absence of immediate opportunities, we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase outstanding shares. As Greg will share with you shortly, we anticipate continuing this repurchase activity in the second half. Overall, strong performance across the board.","Slide 5 walks our earnings per share from the second quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018. The majority of our earnings growth, $0.24, came from segment profit improvement, driven by enhanced sales volumes across the company, the impacts from our commercial excellence efforts, productivity improvements realized through HOS Gold and savings from previously funded and executed restructuring projects.","Below the line items were a $0.05 tailwind this quarter, primarily due to higher pension income, driven by the strong investment performance in the plan and a lower discount rate. This impact was partially offset by higher funding or new repositioning and other projects in the quarter, including about $60 million in high-return restructuring projects. ","The share repurchase actions in the second quarter resulted in a lower weighted average share count of 755 million shares. Combined with the slightly higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, the share repurchases were a $0.04 tailwind to EPS.","We had planned and guided our tax rate at 24% for the quarter compared to 21.3% last year, which would have resulted in a $0.07 headwind to EPS. At this higher 24% planned tax rate, earnings per share would have been $2.06, above the high end of our guidance range by $0.03. We realized a further $0.06 EPS upside from the lower actual tax rate of 21.7% versus that 24% guided rate for the quarter. The tax rate was lower than guided primarily due to the successful resolution of several tax audits. So on a year-over-year basis then, the actual tax rate for the second quarter of 21.7% was slightly higher than the tax rate for 2017 of 21.3%. And despite this headwind, we still achieved an 18% increase in earnings per share. ","Going forward, we expect the pro forma tax rate for the remainder of the year to be similar to our second quarter tax rate, resulting in an estimated rate for the full year that is still in the 22% to 23% range of our original guidance.","Our EPS guidance excludes any potential adjustments to the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 relating to the U.S. tax legislation as well as separation cost associated with the 2 spinoffs. ","In the second quarter, we incurred $346 million or $0.46 of separation cost, $291 million of which were tax costs incurred in the restructuring of the ownership of various legal entities in preparation for the spinoffs. Separation costs to date are in line with our expectations.","Other items composed of adjustments to the fourth quarter U.S. tax legislation charge were a $0.02 benefit to EPS. So netting out, the 2 items resulted in a $0.44 change in reported range per share to $1.68.","Let's turn to Slide 6. Our Aerospace business is performing well in an extremely robust demand environment. Air Transport and Regional flight hours were up 7%. And as you know, the backlogs of our major OEM customers are at record levels. Despite the challenge that this level demand creates for our supply chain, Aerospace sales were up 8% on an organic basis. We had 14% organic growth in defense and space with higher spares volumes on U.S. Department of Defense programs, strong demand for sensors and guidance systems and robust shipment volumes on key programs, including the F-35.","And in commercial OE, sales were up 7% organically, driven by robust HTF engine demand in business aviation; air transport deliveries on key narrow-body platforms, including the 737 and the A320; and lower customer incentives, which added 1 point of organic growth to Aerospace in total in the quarter.","Organic growth in the aftermarket of 4% was driven by maintenance service program activity in business aviation and strong airlines demand. In addition, our connected aircraft software offerings have grown more than 15% year-to-date, driven by demand for our GoDirect cabin software. ","In Transportation Systems, sales were up 7% organically on a continued growth in passenger vehicle; gas turbos in China, Europe and South Korea stemming from new launches; and higher commercial vehicle turbo volumes in North America and China. Aerospace segment profit was up 12%. And segment margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by higher sales volumes, commercial excellence and lower year-over-year customer incentives. In the quarter, there was a 30 basis point headwind from foreign currency, primarily in Transportation Systems business.","In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was 3% for the quarter. Homes grew 7%, driven by continued double-digit growth in residential thermal solutions and strong thermostat demand in North America and Europe. Similar to the first quarter, sales grew across all regions in ADI. ","In buildings, organic sales were flat year-over-year. The commercial fire business was strong in North America and Europe as well as our Connected Buildings business, driven by demand for our Tridium building management platform. In addition, activity in the high-growth regions within Building Solutions was robust with double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter, primarily in India. However, the overall buildings organic growth was tempered by slower bookings and revenue conversion in the North America energy vertical in Building Solutions. ","HBT segment margins expanded 60 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, the benefits from previously funded and executed restructuring and higher sales volumes.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3% on an organic basis, driven by growth in Process Solutions and UOP. Sales in Process Solutions were up 5% organically, largely due to solid backlog conversion in the project automation and solution business and significant growth in the service business. ","UOP sales were up 3% organically, driven by engineering and catalyst growth, the latter being driven by new units in China and refining catalyst reloads. The clients in gas processing and hydrogen from lower modular gas equipment sales partly offset the growth in the rest of UOP. UOP backlog was up 7% in the quarter, pointing to continued to steady sales growth for the second half. ","In Advanced Materials, there was continued growth in solstice low global warming products within Fluorine Products. However, this was offset by lower volumes and a temporary unplanned plant shutdown in specialty products. ","PMT segment margins expanded 50 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, benefits from previously funded and executed restructuring and higher volumes, partly offset by inflation and a temporary lower weighting of higher-margin sales within the catalyst and gas processing businesses.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. We had another strong quarter in Intelligrated with continued new projects activity in the e-commerce area. Intelligrated's orders growth this quarter was again very strong, up more than 40%, adding to an already robust project backlog. There is double-digit growth in productivity products, driven by demand for new Android-based mobility product offerings, coupled with strong growth in scanning and printing applications. The Android launches that we've been previewing are gaining traction with our customers and winning versus the competition in the marketplace. ","Organic growth in the safety business was 5%, with strength in the gas protection and high-risk product categories. Additionally, the SPS China and India businesses each grew more than 20%. SPS generated impressive margin expansion of 150 basis points, enabled by higher sales volumes, commercial excellence and benefits from previously funded and executed restructuring. We're extremely pleased with SPS performance this quarter.","Greg is now going to cover our outlook for the third quarter and the rest of the year. But before he does, I want to reaffirm the confidence I expressed in Greg when we announced in April that he's taking over as CFO of Honeywell effective August 3. Greg and I have worked together since he joined Honeywell in 2006. I can assure you that he has the business acumen, finance acuity, determination and commitment required to excel as the CFO of Honeywell. Working with him every day for the last 3 months on the transition has only reinforced my confidence. I'm a shareowner, and I will sleep well with Greg at the helm. ","So over to you, Greg.","Greg Lewis","Thank you very much, Tom. I appreciate the confidence. Let's move on to Slide 7, and I'd like to start by discussing two important items as a backdrop to our forward look, tariffs and the spins.","Let's start with tariffs. We're proactively managing both the direct and the indirect impacts from the Section 232 and 301 tariffs. We've evaluated and addressed the list of the first $50 billion of goods affected by Section 301 as well as the retaliatory offsets and are currently assessing the potential additional $200 billion of targeted tariffs. We have seen inflation accelerate in a number of areas within the business, most notably in transportation and logistics and in metals. And our procurement, marketing and commercial excellence teams are proactively working on offsets to minimize the impact to our P&L.","Based on the tariffs enacted to date and our mitigation actions across the portfolio, we anticipate a minimal impact to our overall business results in 2018. But this is a very dynamic situation that changes by the day, as further evidenced by this morning's headlines, and we're giving it substantial focus. We've established a robust set of processes in each of our businesses and at the corporate level to ensure we stay on top of the situation. For the known items, we are monitory and rigorously addressing cost increases to our supply chain and adjusting our pricing as necessary. I'm encouraged by what our teams have accomplished so far.","Now for 2019, we're evaluating more structural solutions for longer-term tariff impacts, including potentially bringing on new sources of supply, where needed.","Now let's discuss our progress on our 2 spinoffs, Transportation Systems and Homes. Both businesses are being operationalized, and we're making great progress on building up the leadership teams for each. Earlier this week, you saw the appointment of Carlos Cardoso as Chairman of the Board of Transportation Systems, which will be called Garrett. We're pleased to have a leader with such an impressive track record to strengthen an already well-equipped global business leadership team led by Olivier Rabiller. ","On the external side for both spins, we have filed the draft Form 10s with the SEC and are working through the comment letter process for each. We have completed rating agency presentations and are preparing for the debt and equity roadshows for both companies. In short, we are on track for the completions of both spins in 2018, and both businesses are performing well, as you saw, and we look forward to updating you as the spin dates become clearer.","Lastly, just a reminder that both our quarterly EPS guidance and our full year guidance includes earnings for both spin companies for the full year and excludes separation costs related to those spins and any adjustments to the tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to U.S. tax reform. We had a minor favorable adjustment to the charge in the second quarter. These favorable adjustments may be larger in the second half of the year, and we'll provide you with updates as we move forward.","Now let's move to Slide 8, and we'll discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Overall, our strong order rates and a growing backlog are expected to drive third quarter organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 7%. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 50 basis points, driven by those increased volumes, commercial excellence and material productivity, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. ","We anticipated third quarter earnings per share of $1.95 to $2 or growth of 11% to 14% with a tax rate of approximately 22%.","Moving on to the businesses. In Aerospace, we expect continued strength in commercial aviation, original equipment sales with higher shipment volumes on the Boeing 737, the Embraer L450 and L500 and Dassault F8X platforms. Used business jet inventories are at their lowest levels since before the financial crisis. A number of new aircraft certifications will occur in 2018, and we have good positions on the right platforms across the super midsized and large business jet cabin aircraft. ","In the aftermarket, we expect continued demand driven by airline flight hours growth in ATR and maintenance service plan activity in business aviation. We anticipate continued double-digit growth for the connected aircraft, driven by demand for JetWave hardware and GoDirect services. ","In Defense & Space, we expect another strong quarter, driven by demand for sensors and guidance systems in the U.S. and abroad and spares volume into U.S. DoD and international defense programs.","Within transportation systems, we expect strong gas turbo demand, driven by new platform launches in Europe to continue.","In Home and Building Technologies, we expect strong demand from our commercial fire and connected building technologies, but this will largely be offset by the impact of declines in the energy backlog in Building Solutions in the first half. ","Within Homes, we anticipate continued growth in products, driven by demand for thermostats and residential thermal solutions and continued strength in ADI.","On Performance Materials and Technologies, we are anticipating healthy growth in each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Process Solutions, we expect continued backlog conversion in the projects business and short-cycle demand in the software and life cycle solutions and services businesses, driven by our strong first half short-cycle orders growth. In Advanced Materials, we expect continued strength from customer adoption of our solstice low-global warming products and Fluorine Products and better volumes in specialty products. ","In UOP, we expect robust equipment, engineering and catalyst demand with continued growth from new catalyst units in China. Based on the timing and composition of those expected catalyst shipments in the second half, we do expect that PMT margins will be down in the third quarter, but those margin rates will significantly increase in the fourth quarter. Those quarter-to-quarter dynamics are not unusual in this business, and I believe we've talked about them before. Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect continued outperformance in Intelligrated, driven by strong orders growth and project backlog awarded in the first half of 2018. ","In productivity products, we expect that our new mobility product launches continue to gain momentum in the marketplace, building on a strong second quarter. In safety, we expect growth in all industrial safety categories and continued growth in retail as we approach the holiday season. China and India are each anticipated to have another quarter of double-digit growth.","Now moving to Slide 9 to discuss our full year guidance. As Darius mentioned, we've raised our full year sales, segment margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance to reflect our strong performance in the second quarter and confidence in our outlook for the second half of 2018. Our revised guidance incorporates the minor impacts of the currently known tariffs. We'll continue to monitor the plans to address the impacts, if any, from other potential tariffs that have been announced but not yet enacted. Full year organic sales are now expected to be up 5% to 6%. This is driven by favorable conditions in our end markets, our emphasis on organic growth initiatives like commercial excellence and continued penetration at the high-growth regions, along with robust long cycle order rates and backlogs. We've narrowed our segment margin guidance to 40 to 60 basis points, the high end of our prior range, which reflects our strong first half and confidence in strong sales volumes in the second half. ","We significantly increased our free cash flow guidance to a new range of $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion, driven by higher net income and better working capital performance across the business, as you've seen in the second quarter. This new range implies conversion of 92% to 100%, a strong improvement from the 90% we posted in 2017. Our estimates for the full year effective tax rate continue to be between 22% and 23%.","We have also raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.20 on the low end and $0.10 in the high end, as Darius mentioned. This new range of $8.05 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of 13% to 15%. Our guidance reflects the revised weighted average share count of 754 million shares, which includes the $1.7 billion in share repurchases in the first half and an estimate of the repurchases planned for the remainder of 2018.","We anticipate this will provide a $0.03 benefit to EPS in the second half of the year versus our previous guide. On a segment level, we now expect Aerospace organic sales growth to be 7% to 8% versus the previous guidance range of 3% to 5%, driven by the continued recovery of the business aviation market and robust demand within our defense business. In Home and Building Technologies, we raised the low end of our organic sales guidance by 1 point to 2% to 3% and the low end of our margin guidance by 10 basis points to 30 to 50 basis points improvement. Our organic growth and margin outlook for Performance Materials and Technologies has not changed. However, we have updated the reported sales outlook to reflect the headwinds and foreign currency translation in the second half of the year.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we have increased our organic sales growth expectations to 7% to 8% versus the previous guidance range of 4% to 6% and increased our segment margin guidance to a new range of 16.0% to 16.2%, up 90 to 110 basis points for the year. Safety and Productivity Solutions had an outstanding second quarter, and our investments in the Intelligrated business and the new Android-based product launches within productivity products are delivering for us. Our revised outlook reflects increased confidence that SPS will continue to deliver in the second half of the year.","So let's wrap up on Slide 10. Honeywell delivered outstanding operational performance in the second quarter with 6% organic sales growth, 60 basis points of margin expansion, 18% earnings growth and 42% free cash flow growth. On top of our financial performance, we continue to make significant progress in becoming a software industrial leader. Our connected offerings are helping our customers solve critical challenges across our large installed base. We expect the momentum we have seen in the first half of the year to continue within the second half. Our orders rates remain strong, and our backlog continues to grow. Soon, we will spin off our Transportation Systems and Homes businesses. We have made great progress to prepare both to stand alone as independently publicly traded companies. We look forward to sharing more on our continued strong performance with you as the year progresses.","And with that, let's move to Mark for Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Greg. Darius, Tom and Greg are now available to answer your questions. So Kathy, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Greg, welcome to the call. And Tom, it's been great working with you the last five years. Wishing nothing but the best in retirement.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks, Joe.","Greg Lewis","Thank you, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","Maybe just starting off. Obviously, organic growth has been really good the last four quarters. You're taking up the organic growth guidance for the year. It's interesting to see that long-cycle backlog continuing to grow double digits as well. So maybe, Darius, just touch on how much visibility do you already have going into 2019 on -- just based on how good your long-cycle businesses are performing today?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I mean, as you kind of think about that 60-40 split that we talked about before, obviously, I'm gaining more confidence by the day because that kind of backlog growth -- double-digit backlog growth, double-digit growth in orders is tremendous. We're actually very bullish also on the PMT segment kicking in much more significantly in the second half based on the activity of our pipeline. So obviously, as I look forward to 2019, although I'm still focused on 2018, we've got a couple quarters to go, but there's no question that based on what we're seeing, we're -- the things are shaping up nicely for another strong year in 2019 based on current activity.","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, it seems like it. And it's interesting to see you guys call out Amazon today. I think that was the first time, at least, that I had heard their name mentioned. I'm just curious, like, whether you're starting to deepen your relationship there and maybe just any color around that specific project in Canada would be helpful.","Darius Adamczyk","Amazon has been a great customer. We've had a long-term partnership. We're -- in some ways, we're a supplier and a customer. So it kind of goes in both directions. The Intelligrated solutions are extraordinary well respected. And they hit the part of warehouse automation that's growing the fastest, and that's around e-commerce. I've talked about that before. That, that is truly the sweet spot of Intelligrated offerings is in the high speed, high throughput. That's a solution that's second to none, and we're seeing that being reflected in our growth rates. And as I said before in a number of calls, this will turn out to be the -- probably the best acquisitions we've ever done, and I continue to feel very strongly about that.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. Maybe if I could sneak one more in. Look, you guys have been talking about this improvement in cash flow now for a couple years and we're really, really starting to see the benefits of it. Just curious whether there were any kind of onetime benefits that helped you this quarter on the cash flow conversion and how you guys are thinking about that now that you've raised your guidance for the year on the free cash flow side?","Darius Adamczyk","No, I'm glad you asked that question, Joe, because that is -- to me, that's a real highlight of the quarter. I mean, I really think that the kind of focus we've had within the company on working capital, on terms, on executing on our inventory, receivables, all those things are really kind of coming together and being reflected. Our working capital turn are getting better. We're getting less -- driving less capital intensity. A lot of the investments we're paying that we've made are paying off, and it's a really, really nice story. And it kind of all came together here in Q2 cash flow, and we expect that momentum to continue. So we feel good about what we're doing. We'll continue to add more tools to HOS Gold to help our teams drive working capital, and it's really gratifying to see a lot of that come through in the numbers. And we're not done. We've got more tailwinds ahead of us so...","Greg Lewis","Yes. Maybe I could just add to that. This has been a 4-quarter story. I mean, we've got 4\/10 of a turn improvement versus a year ago but you're seeing sequentially each quarter that number continues to get better. We've improved by about 1\/10 of a turn in each of the most recent 4 quarters, so that is definitely a momentum shift with the efforts that have been going on around the business.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","I'll share a similar commentary. Tom, it's been a pleasure. You've had a great run and deserve a lot of credit for following the big footsteps of Mr. Anderson. And Greg, I'm sure you'll do a great as well. So it's been a pleasure.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks, Scott.","Greg Lewis","Thank you.","Scott Davis","There's just not been much to pick on with you folks in a couple years, but the building side of the business is one that I always kind of struggled to figure out what it is. It's a good business or not a good business. But what do you think keeps the building owners from spending money? I mean, they should be cash flowing pretty well right now. Why aren't they investing more heavily? Do you guys have a sense to that?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, I think, frankly, it's a little bit of -- we have to do an even better job of communicating the value of our connected buildings. But as we talked about in some of our win examples, when you secure a building like the Burj Khalifa, which is kind of the -- not probably as prestigious a building as there is anywhere in the world and the building owner sees the value in our connected building solutions, that tells you something. So I think that there is more headway here for us. Frankly, also in Q2, we had some operational issues on the electronic side. So this print could have been a little bit better than it actually was. We're working through our backlog situation that should correct itself in Q3 and Q4. But overall, we feel pretty good about the kind of offerings we have. And I'd say something else in the Connected Buildings. We're in different steps of evolution of all our connected plays, whether it's connected aircraft, connected buildings, plant and so on. I actually think that a lot of the solutions that we have in connected buildings are more commercial-ready than maybe a lot of the other offerings that we have. So we've installed a new leader in HBT with a great deal of confidence, and [indiscernible] has tremendous track record in process solutions. And we're very confident he's going to do the same in HBT.","Scott Davis","Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, guys. The -- what percentage of revenues do you think are connected now? So I know you have got a big potential for connectivity, but is it -- is it something you can really measure at this juncture?","Darius Adamczyk","Think about -- yes, it's north of $1.5 billion that's purely the connected revenues. That's not the total software business, just to be clear.","Scott Davis","Yes, understood. And I imagine that's strong free cash flow as well probably, right?","Darius Adamczyk","Absolutely.","Operator","We will now move to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Tusa","Congrats to Greg. Tom, thanks for all your help. Congrats also on a great run.","Thomas Szlosek","Thank you, Steve.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Steve.","Charles Tusa","And Darius, I think you can shorten the intro on Intelligrated and just say Amazon, and I think people will be pretty happy with that. So just some advice there. Anyway, just kidding around. So I think Scott took care of most of the nitpicking here. On free cash flow, again, kind of this year, the progress you've made, would you expect to kind of continue to see the progress into 2019? I mean, are these the types of things that, with the business mix and with what you're doing, that you can kind of grow that again a little bit faster perhaps than earnings whatever ever earnings may grow in 2019 as well?","Darius Adamczyk","Absolutely, Steve. I mean, I think this is -- if you go back to that playbook, and I'll say the playbook really came out all the way in Investor Day of 2016. When you think about all the factors that I talked about, right, which is accelerating our organic growth rate, continued margin enhancement, improved cash conversion, transforming to a software industrial and deploying -- be more aggressive around capital deployment, I think we could put all those things together, we can point clear signs to every one of those things that we're doing. And obviously, cash conversion was one of those elements. We committed to be in the 90s this year. I feel even more confident of us being there, and I continue to be bullish about us making progress in '19 and beyond.","Charles Tusa","And then you guys, I believe, you bought back another $700 million worth of stock this quarter. And it's a little bit kind of late in the year for M&A, at least to close. So there would seem to be a decent amount of cash that's kind of left over when you think about the kind of annual run rate of potential. Is that the kind of fair way to look at it? That if we get to another quarter here, we'll be pretty consistent on this buyback phase? Or are you more or less bullish about kind of the acquisition pipeline here?","Darius Adamczyk","No, I have, by no means, given up on getting an acquisition closed this year. I think we still have a shot to do so. We're looking at a number of things. You never know which way they're going to go. I mean, so far, a lot of them have gone left rather than right for one reason or another, but we're far from giving up and getting a decent acquisition done here or maybe even a couple. But the calculus has always been, okay, if we can't deploy capital through acquisitions, bolt-ons, which has always been our preference, then we're going to deploy back in the form of buybacks. And I thought it was a very attractive entry point as I talked about it at the end of Q1 in the $140. So I was more than happy to buy back the shares.","Charles Tusa","And how much -- if you didn't know deals from here on out, how much would you be able to buy back this year?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I mean, we've got a lot -- it's -- we've got a lot of cash in the balance sheet, but I'm not planning on spending all of it so...","Thomas Szlosek","We talked about, at the beginning of the year, of having capital deployed of $5 billion to $6 billion in total for the full year. And that's available capital. That's not -- we're not committed to like spending every single dollar of that. But it just gives you a sense that that's healthy. And with a better free cash flow, I think we'll have more opportunity.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, the framework I think that I provided, Steve, just to be consistent, and I'd still stick with it, which is if you think about a dividend someplace around the $3 billion mark for the 2 spins, I'm going to have to use some of that to pay down debt, something in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. The rest of that I'm committing to buybacks. So I'm kind of done that already. On top of that, I would do what I need to do to keep share count flat, which is another half or so. And then on top of that, we might do a little bit more. So that's kind of a rough framework. And it's a little bit -- the calculus gets a little fuzzy depending upon whether or not we do have a transaction. It's going to be a little bit less if we do another transaction. It might be a bit more if we don't. So -- and also, we'll see where the entry points are.","Charles Tusa","No, it's clear. Having more cabbage is better than not having any cabbage. That's very clear.","Operator","We'll now go to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","I just want to again come back to cash flow. And Darius, as you're probably well aware, actually, your conversion is a lot better than it looks to the naked eye, right, given your noncash pension income there is here. So now that we're kind of -- yes, no, it's extraordinary. And so now that we're kind of approaching a level where cash flow per share is kind of in line with your EPS guidance per se, what do you think about maybe trying to do something on pension and kind of taking that out of the equation here? I don't know if you can extract value from it or not. Obviously, it's in great financial shape but just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, yes, I mean, obviously, that's something we thought about. We've derisked half of it, so half of that exposure is gone. Our pension is funded at like 113%, 114% range. So even if you think about some kind of a major step back in terms of the market at 20% reduction, we'd still be fully funded. So do we -- there is some benefit to having some below-the-line income as well come through. It does hurt cash conversion, but there are some benefits as well. So obviously, we're thinking about that. No further decisions will be made. But I thought taking at least half that risk completely off the table like we did earlier this year was wise, particularly given were the markets were, and we'll see what we do from here.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then separately, just if we can, can we put a finer point on spin timing? Do you think Turbo can still be a Q3 event? Or is there a little bit of an inclusive slippage? And just your commentary here about both being a second half event.","Greg Lewis","Yes, no slippage. We are going according to plan. I think we talked about the end of the third quarter for turbo, and that is well aligned with our current thinking. Homes is also coming right behind it. We're very much in the throes of the preparations there as well, so nothing different. I think we feel pretty good about the things that we can control. And obviously, with the SEC process, that one is a bit out of our hands, but it's going well.","Operator","And we now move to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks to Tom and welcome to Greg. Maybe just first question about Aerospace. Just wondered how long you thought it was sustainable for Defense & Space to keep outgrowing commercial aftermarket by such a distance. And also, I guess, in commercial aftermarket, should we expect some recovery there or acceleration over the next 12 months given the favorable macro?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. On Defense & Space, they continue to be bullish given what we're seeing in the -- not just the U.S. defense budgets that's certainly positive, but also a lot of the NATO countries' defense budgets. And I don't know if they're all going to reach the 2% of GDP level, but it's very clear that many of them are going up. So that's -- that continues to be -- continue to be bullish on that segment. In terms of kind of the aftermarket part of our business, I think a couple of things to point out. One is we're shifting more of that mix to longer-term contracts. So I discussed this a little bit at the end of Q1. So we're going to see a little bit more of kind of steady-state rather than kind of complete alignment with flight hours. We still feel good about what we did. Two is we have a little bit more of an avionics versus mechanical focus versus some of the others, which probably see greater -- even higher correlation to flight hours. And three is we are still very much in kind of a past due situation on the backlog. I mean, we are seeing some challenges in kind of the Tier 3, Tier 4 supply chains. And frankly, these numbers could have been even better, and we're working through those to -- and we expect to really be in a much, much better shape by the end of the year. But nevertheless, things are a bit too strained on the supply chain and I think that's very consistent with what you're hearing from a lot of the other aerospace players as well.","Thomas Szlosek","Yes. I would add that I think that we're going to be fine on the aftermarket, but it is tough to compete with the defense backlog. I mean, you saw the growth rates in the quarter, and the backlog is up well into the double digits. So when does that stop, nobody really knows. But right now, for the foreseeable future, that is very strong backlog to work from as well. So you have both of them going in the right direction.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question would be switching to Safety and Productivity. So obviously, very good growth in productivity within that. My assumption would have been that a lot of that was fueled by large projects, businesses like Intelligrated that might carry a lower margin. So I'm intrigued, I guess, by the extent of the margin uplift in the guide at SPS. So maybe give any color, I guess, around what's going on in that margin guidance uplift. And are you seeing much better margins on large projects perhaps that you might have done historically?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, a couple of comments. I think certainly, we're seeing better margins there in Intelligrated. But the other thing, let's not forget that, it's been a -- it's a really nice story in SPS throughout all our businesses, granted Intelligrated grew faster than a number of the others. But if you, let's say, look productivity products, which really had a really nice quarter this quarter, double-digit growth, substantial margin expansion, and this is very consistent. If you go back to a lot of the earnings call last year, I talked about us getting that business back on track. And I'm very pleased to see that John and the team really kind of got that business going again. It was a tremendous story. Our SIoT business had another strong quarter. So it's -- the kind of margin expansion growth we're seeing in SPS is just -- it's not just limited to Intelligrated. It's really across the board. There isn't a single business that didn't have a good quarter in SPS.","Greg Lewis","Yes. And if I could just add, I mean, there is a lot of self-help in the businesses that we had. And if you remember part of the Intelligrated thesis as we have other businesses with that business model and part of the integration benefits is some of those practice is coming over from the HPS projects business, as an example, to the Intelligrated projects business so that we'll run that more efficiently. And they're starting to adopt some of those things as well. So that's part of the expectation of what we had laid out when we bought the business also, was to be able to help it run itself on a much more efficient basis as part of Honeywell.","Operator","Our next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC Capital markets.","Deane Dray","Add my congrats to Tom and Greg.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks, Deane.","Greg Lewis","Thank you.","Deane Dray","I know this is under the category of high-quality problem. But when I hear Intelligrated orders up 40%, it just raises concerns about whether you're -- might be taking on too much your potential risk of overpromising, underdelivering and maybe your pricing is not appropriate if you're seeing that kind of order surge. So just kind of talk us through that. I know it's a high-quality problem, but just take us through what the implications of such rapid growth.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, let's start with the pricing because it's a couple of different questions. I mean, I would tell you that Intelligrated margins are expansion -- are expanding, not contracting. A lot of that is due to self-help. We're becoming much more efficient. We're leveraging a much broader global footprint to complete the work. And frankly, this is a technology business. When you can process 400 boxes a minute versus 350, customers are willing to pay for that. And I would say that right now, and it's just going to continue to stay this way. This is the best technology available in the marketplace, so it's pretty clearly to see why we are where we are. In terms of the -- that kind of growth, 40%, that's -- it's not surprising to us. We've known that this was coming. We continue to be very bullish about a lot more growth.","So you guys should expect kind of double-digit orders growth here in the second half as well. And we've been preparing for it. We're building out capacity, capability and we're staffing up very, very quickly. We're exceptional at project execution. That's also why we win as often as we do. And frankly, the Intelligrated team is using a lot of the HOS Gold toolkit to continue to execute and also leveraging a lot of the things that were done in Honeywell Process Solutions because the leader now of Intelligrated is somebody who was a leader in HPS. So all those things are kind of coming together, and I feel very bullish on our ability to be able to process that backlog successfully.","Deane Dray","Good to hear. And just a separate question for Tom and\/or Greg. Is the idea on tax reform is there might have been some -- it might be some simplification opportunities in your tax structure? We talked about that before. Is any of that beginning to come through? And maybe at all, it's -- you can't tell yet with the work you're doing on the spins and the separation of legal entities, but just what your line of sight on the simplification of your tax structure and some cost savings that might fall through.","Greg Lewis","Yes, great. That's a great question. We are working through that real time, as you can imagine. And as you alluded to, the spins do play a role in creating some of that clarity. So that as we get closer to the spins, we'll have a better view on exactly what those impacts will be. But we are working on exactly that as we speak. And as alluded to in the outlook, I think in the second half of the year, as that does become much clearer, we'll be able to give you some more specifics about what that impact will be. But for certain, we will have a more simplified structure as we go forward and adapt to the new tax legislation.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just a question. We're getting a lot of questions from investors on potential for global slowdown, and I'm just trying to reconcile this with accelerated organic growth and Honeywell into second half of '19. Could you just take us around the world and just describe what you're seeing in your key geographies? Are you seeing any slowdown anywhere?","Darius Adamczyk","No. I mean, I think yes and no. China, for example, last year, our growth was in the 20s. Currently, we see it a little bit more kind of in the teens, but I wouldn't exactly call that a slowdown. I mean, maybe relatively speaking, it's a slowdown. India continues to be double-digit growth. LatAm was strong. Central Europe was strong. When I say strong, all double-digit kind of growth kind of figure. So overall, we're not seeing much of a slowdown. Now you couple all that with our backlog growth, our long-cycle order growth, you couple with some of the past due situations we have in Aerospace, right now, I'm continuing to be bullish overall on the growth. So based on what we're seeing right now, based on the orders, long cycle, short cycle that we're seeing, there's every reason for me to continue to be bullish on our growth. Could that change? Of course, but I'm not seeing it right now.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up on Aerospace. As we're thinking about the defense part of the business, is it just fair just to look at modernization authority growth? Or are there some specific programs that are driving this accelerated growth?","Darius Adamczyk","No. I mean, it's -- yes, it's really both because, as you know, our defense business in Aerospace is really so widespread. So it's not really tied to any one given program. And whether it's tanks, aircraft, all those will drive the right financial outcomes for us. And it's widespread both in the U.S. and the international arena. So it's -- as the defense budgets grow, so will our business, and we're seeing that.","Andrew Obin","But that implies, if you look at modernization authority, it should grow like high single digits for a while. So the business should keep up with that?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, by the way, we've also expanded some capacity in Aerospace just to -- especially in the area of industrials and so on. So we've got capacity expansion that's already taking place to keep up with that demand. And frankly, we knew that a lot of the air transport market was going to take off. We've adjusted to that. Now we're trying to pull the supply chain -- kind of the Tier 2, Tier 3 supply chain along with that to make sure that they can keep up, and there's been a lot of energy spent on us working with our supplies to make sure that they're ready for what we believe is the new normal.","Operator","And our final question will come from Steven Winoker of UBS.","Steven Winoker","Tom, congratulations for more than just this role. I think it's been, what, 12 years since our days at ACS? It's been a long run.","Thomas Szlosek","Yes. You're an insider still, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Yes. Well, never quite leave. Try to. You make me sound like a broken record on these quarters now. And the cash, particularly great to see that traction so quickly all. So I know that's hard. A couple questions here. One around -- nobody I think has gone into some detail on the Q&A on PMT and HPS maybe particularly, some of the dynamics there, obviously, of tough comps in advanced materials. We have oil moving steadily. So can you maybe talk about some of the dynamics and what's the potential for acceleration in HPS and UOP at least?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, HPS performed very, very well in the second quarter. It's up mid-single digit for the first half of the year. It's a business that's been on an absolute tear for a long time now. Our order rates are strong. We're actually even more bullish in the second half of the year. As you know, it now contains the Smart Energy business, which we moved in there, which is also gaining acceleration, and that is part of that management team. So overall, we're very bullish on continued HPS performance. And overall, between HPS and UOP, kind of our \"log\" looks very strong for the second half, and we expect to convert a lot of that to orders. So overall, I'm very pleased with what we're seeing in PMT.","Steven Winoker","And by the way, Darius, what is the margin rate impact these days of an implication of HPS growth? Because I know you've moved up so much over the years.","Darius Adamczyk","Can you say that again, Steve?","Steven Winoker","So just in terms of HPS impact on -- and PMT segment margin as it's now growing more quickly than the rest of the segments.","Darius Adamczyk","It is in line with overall PMT margin rates. Maybe a little bit south, but it's -- it isn't accretive or dilutive materially.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And do you still see margin expansion opportunity in that subsegment?","Darius Adamczyk","For sure. Yes, absolutely. Especially, I think the team is doing a tremendous job and further driving productivity in Smart Energy. I mean, they -- the HPS team really knows how to drive productivity well. The Smart Energy business, frankly, has an opportunity to do a lot of that. It's a projects business, [indiscernible] business, both areas that are very, very comfortable for HPS. And as you know, in the second half of last year, they had taken the business on and are already seeing progress, and there is much more to come. So they're far from done in terms of margin expansion in HPS.","Greg Lewis","Yes. It's one of our more mature, I'd say, connected enterprises in terms of that software offering so we absolutely have a nice tailwind there on margins.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And just lastly on Page 7, that's really helpful in terms of the tariff inflation comment. But we're hearing a lot about pricing from other companies. How much of your offset is a really pricing action playing into this? Or are there really just a lot of other things going on?","Greg Lewis","Yes. We're doing a mix of both pricing and some sourcing changes as well as we're benefiting from having locked in some purchases earlier in the year. So of our mitigations, I would say it's probably 2\/3, 1\/3 in terms of pricing versus our sourcing actions. But so far, we've had success passing through where appropriate. And as I discussed, we're -- this thing changes by the day, and this is -- in fact, this is a weekly cadence we have going on across the entire enterprise. So not much grass is growing under our feet as this is changing.","Thomas Szlosek","Yes. Just to add to that, I think the key here is to get ahead of it early, and I think we definitely have. And then we haven't lost focus. This is literally a weekly activity for us and probably the single most important thing that we talk about in making sure that we're proactive. We're being ahead of here because if you sit and wait, you could see substantial margin contraction. So we're doing a good job managing, but there's still a lot of unknowns here that we don't know that we're planning for.","Greg Lewis","Yes. I mean, we're benefiting from the fact that we do have a lot of local-for-local business constructs, so that's been helpful to us. And in fact, there's going to be some places where us sourcing from non-China sources are going to be competitively helpful where others are sourcing from China. So it's a complex equation. There's obviously the sourcing challenges, but there are also some places where it could be competitively advantageous to us as well. So we're trying to make a good balance.","Darius Adamczyk","And just to highlight that point that Greg just made, which is we have a structure, for the most part, not perfectly, but we're kind of regionally hub-oriented. So we have kind of a local-for-local sourcing, engineering, marketing supply chain base. So we're -- I wouldn't tell you we're not impacted, but we're a lot more prepared because of our global footprint and how we operate the business.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. I have full confidence that the strong performance we delivered for our shareowners in the first and second quarters will continue throughout the rest of the year. Our order rates are strong, our backlogs are growing, and we're realizing the benefits from our continued efforts to drive software and connected growth, productivity, commercial excellence and improve free cash flow. Honeywell is well positioned to continue to deliver, and I hope that is evident in both the second quarter performance and the commitments we made to you today. ","Before we end, I want to take a minute to thank Tom Szlosek for all his contributions to the company. Tom has gracefully navigated the businesses and the finance organization through some pretty significant changes and challenges over the past four years. It has been a pleasure to have Tom on my staff and at the company for the past 14 years and wish him all the best in the future. Congratulations on a successful career, Tom.","Thomas Szlosek","Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","On behalf of the entire Honeywell team, I wish you a pleasant rest of the summer. Thank you.","Thomas Szlosek","Great.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

(NYSE:HON) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Elena Doom - Vice President of Investor Relations","David Cote - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer","David Anderson - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President","Analysts","Scott Davis - Barclays","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Zack. Welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, as well as share with you our guidance for the fourth and full year 2014. Finally as always, we will leave time for your questions.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. As I am sure you have seen by now, Honeywell delivered another good quarter capping off a terrific 2013. We are benefiting from our diverse portfolio and that continued focus on new products and geographic expansion plus our ability to effectively manage and what continues to be slow growth macro environment.","The importance of a balanced portfolio was evident last year as it helped us to offset some of the headwinds we faced in Defense and Space and Advanced Materials over the course of the year. Most importantly, the businesses, all executed very well, delivering margin expansion in every business last year","As for the fourth quarter, it's very encouraging to see sales growth 8%, up 5% organically, with organic growth better than expected across all four businesses. We continue to drive margin expansion, up 50 basis points year-over-year, for an impressive 70 basis points when you exclude M&A, and we delivered pro forma earnings per share with all of $1.24, $0.02 above the high-end of our range, so we are starting this year with positive momentum struck by order rates continue to get better and there were pockets of acceleration in the commercial aftermarket ESS, Advanced Materials and Turbo, all suggesting a modest improvement in end market conditions overall.","We are also seeing order momentum out of our long-cycle businesses, building on the robust backlog has positioned us well heading into this year, with ACS solutions orders up strong double digits, and our defense backlog up about 20% year-over-year due to strong international wins.","We are also increasingly confident in our outlook because of the smart gain deployment actions we took in the fourth quarter. As you saw from our press release, we are able to proactively fund restructuring and other actions fully deploying the $195 million pre-tax or $0.16 EPS gain from the sale of B\/E Aerospace shares in the fourth quarter.","You will recall, we received about 6 million shares prior to the Consumable Solutions business sale in 2008, and we sold 2.6 million of those shares in that fourth quarter. We also sold an incremental 1.5 million shares in this first quarter, and that will yield about a $0.10 gain that we will similarly deploy with repositioning and other actions.","So in total, a pretax gain of approximately $300 million; $200 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million in the first quarter with some more remaining in the bank. Restructuring benefits have been an important driver of our productivity engine, as it will continue to drive benefits in 2014 and beyond.","Dave will take you through some of the details in a moment, but the projects funded in the fourth quarter alone are estimated to yield about $50 million of benefits in 2015, with a full run rate savings of over $100 million. We are being proactive about keeping that pipeline full, and as such, we are planning to fund additional projects in the first quarter with the gain that we will have from those B\/E share sales.","We think these actions position us well for further margin expansion over the next five years. In the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to accelerate a $50 million charge related to environmental matters at Lake Onondaga in upstate, New York. Minimizing future environmental headwinds from this site by proactively seeking agreements for the completion of both dredging and capping activities based on our ability to complete the dredging portion a year early and reducing the overall cost of the project.","We think this sets us up very well over the coming five years as we will begin to show moderation in ongoing environmental charges in the out years. We also offset the loss on sale of Friction Materials due to deployment of that B\/E share gain. As you saw earlier this month, we agreed to sell Friction Materials, which we expect to close sometime in the second half of the year.","We think this transaction will help our Turbo business focus on their differentiated technologies and long-term growth outlook. While we think it's prudent to remain cautious on the overall macro environment, we are also increasingly confident in our 2014 outlook based on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter. So for the year, more of what you have come to expect, strong sales conversion and double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow.","We are going to continue to remain flexible, and while managing our cost is important, we are also focused on supporting sales growth and investing in high ROI capacity in PMT, new products and technologies, and growth regions. Our strong backlog in new product pipeline are setting us up for a multi-year cycle of outperformance. For example, Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat with voice control won the Envisioneering Innovation & Design Award for 2014 at the International Consumer Electronics Show. This latest connected home innovation employs new voice technology allowing people to simply saw, \u201chello thermostat\u201d, to activate and control their home's temperature, and I\u2019ve got to say it is pretty cool. I have got it in my own house, and it's pretty neat because if nobody else is listening, at least your thermostat does what you ask it to.","And as everyone at Honeywell knows, I am extremely optimistic about where we can take our proprietary cloud-based voice control solutions. We are focused on providing a more productive and enhanced customer experience and our guys keep getting better and smarter with a bunch of new stuff in the pipeline. You can expect to see lots of cool innovations at the March Investor Day, where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for future growth and productivity.","We are focused on delivering 2014, but we will also be issuing new five-year targets through 2018 that we think will continue to differentiate Honeywell. Our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries, our strength of execution and the power of One Honeywell will allow us to deliver on those targets and it continues to outperform again.","So with that, I will turn it over to Dave.","David Anderson","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for participating in this morning's call. Let me start on slide number 4, the 4Q13 results. As you can see from the numbers, we delivered at or above guidance on every metric in the quarter. Sales came in at $10.4 billion, above the high-end of our guidance range. They grew an impressive 8% on a reported basis, 5% on an organic basis. The strength we saw at the year-end was broad-based, as Dave said, with better than expected results really across each of the segments. We will take you through those details in just a moment.","On a regional basis, organic sales were up 5% in the U.S., up 4% in Europe and we had organic growth of 13% in the fourth quarter in China. Segment profit growth and margin expansion were both strong. Segment profit increased 12%, margins expanded 50 basis points to 16.1%, and if you exclude M&A which of course was largely the impact of Intermec, segment margins expanded 70 basis points with growth in all four of the businesses. Productivity continues to be a key driver, of course, offsetting inflation and also offsetting the continued investments that we make for growth.","When you move below the line, which we are going to detail further on the next slide, you will see that our gain from the B\/E share was fully deployed through higher restructuring, environmental charges, as well as the recognized loss on the sale of Friction. Pro forma earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment, was $1.24, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis. Now, the fourth quarter reported EPS was $1.19, up $0.32 from last year which you will recall included roughly last year a $1 billion pretax mark-to-market.","This year, in the U.S., we ended up with no MTM adjustment as the potential gain which would have occurred was offset by the proactive adoption of the latest pension mortality tables, specifically the latest 2013 BB projection scale for those technical pension experts out there. So, what remained was an adjustment in our international plans, primarily due to lower interest rates in Germany or about $50 million pretax or $0.05 earnings per share. In the U.S., we ended the year with a discount rate of 4.89%, a return on assets of 23.1%, which contributed to 100% funded status globally in our pension plans at year-end.","Now, for the full year 2014, we are now expecting about $130 million pension income lift in 2014, compared to 2013, based on those better than expected return on assets. We expect this lift to generally be offset with higher OPEB and repositioning expenses over the course of the year, so that's the same as we guided when we spoke to you in December. Finally, free cash flow in the quarter of $1.4 billion, represented 142% free cash flow conversion and brought the full year conversion to just under 100%.","So with that, let's go to the one-time gains and deployment. Slide number five gives you a little bit more detailed view of the deployment of the B\/E share gain. As you can see and as we\u2019ve said, that $0.16 per share gain from the sale of 2.6 million shares in the fourth quarter equals the amount recognized for restructuring actions, corrective environmental remedies, and the sale of Friction.","Restructuring represented about half of the gain deployment, and building on some of the themes you have heard from us before and you will hear more about it in March, at our Investor Day, these restructuring actions really support our future performance. On average, the projects included in the fourth quarter have a little longer paybacks than our historic average, but still very good ROIs that provide a modest tailwind for 2014 earnings, really again supporting the confidence that we have in our guidance range, but that benefit will roughly double to approximately $50 million of PBT or EBIT in 2015, with further benefits in 2016 as we realize run rate savings from these actions of approximately $110 million per year.","Next, you can see the incremental environmental charge. Dave referenced earlier. I am not going to into detail in this. Again, it's the proactive agreement that we sought on the ongoing Lake Onondaga remediation.","We are now likely to complete as he said, dredging activities of year earlier. As a result, we got better visibility on the cost profile going forward and that supports the production and cost efficiencies that leads to moderation in our out year expenses over the next five years. Finally, the recently announced sale of Friction Materials to Federal-Mogul, which results in a $0.04 loss in the quarter, the transaction is expected to close as we said in the second half of the year and until then, of course, the Friction business will remain part of our full-year 2014 outlook.","Finally, based on the roughly 1.5 million B\/E shares we sold in the first quarter, so quarter to-date, we expect an additional $0.10 per share gain that we intend to deploy further to restructuring and other actions similar to what we have in the fourth quarter. Overall these actions, again, will help position the company very well for future earnings growth.","Let's go next to Slide 6, and talk a little bit about the full-year results 2013. Sales up 4%, 2% organic to $39.1 billion, of course the reported sales reflect the favorable impact of acquisitions, primarily Thomas Russell, Intermec and also Rae Systems.","Segment profit for the year, up 8%, double the growth in sales demonstrating again impressive conversion translating to 70 basis points of margin expansion to 16.3%, really terrific, terrific performance continuing that track record at Honeywell. All of this resulted in pro forma earnings per share of $4.97, up 11% over 2012. Again, another year of double-digit growth.","You recall, we set the bar high for 2013, and we delivered again above the high end of the range. Again, our reported EPS for the year reflects a $0.05 mark-to-market adjustment related to international plans as I discussed with you earlier. Finally for the full year, free cash flow at $3.8 billion was slightly above our guidance, driven by the strong finish to the year, despite an increase in CapEx in 2013, and a lot of that of course going to the initial stages of capacity expansion for PMT, and more about that later as we talk about 2014.","Now let's go through the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year for each of the segments starting with Slide 7 Aerospace. Sales growth turned positive as you can see for Aero in the quarter, up 3% organic at the high-end of our guidance range.","I would like to take a minute just before we get into each of the components of Aero, just to walk you through some one-time items that netted within the quarter within the Aero segment. Aero recognized a significant IP litigation settlement which resulted in a royalty gain in the fourth quarter of $63 million pretax. We have line of sight to the timing of this in the quarter and we proactively insured timing was aligned with roughly $68 million of BGA OE payments. Both of these items impacted sales and segment profit. They were contemplated when we give our outlook for aerospace in December, so they net and literally have no or de minimis impact in terms of the reported numbers in terms of the segment profit and segment margin numbers for Aero in the quarter.","With that background, turning to the commercial businesses. Commercial OE sales were flat in the quarter, however up 12% if you exclude the impact of the OE payments that I mentioned earlier. We saw the continued benefit of higher OE build rates in large air transport and strong sales to high value business jet platforms. That would include Gulfstream and Dassault, which both had good double-digit numbers. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 5% in the quarter supported by favorable flight hour trends both in ATR and also robust repairs, modifications and upgrades or RMU sales in BGA partially offset by fewer engine maintenance events in the quarter. Notable in the quarter was the improvement in ATR spare which we expect to continue in terms of a run rate in 2014.","Now in defense and space. Sales were up 2% but down 3% excluding the royalty gain in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Defense continues to be impacted by planned program ramp downs and delays in the U.S., partially offset by growth in the international markets. However on the positive side, as Dave referenced, the backlog for defense was up significantly in 2013. So a positive sign as we look forward to the next five years. Ensuring the segment profit, note that the higher royalties in defense and space were offset, again, by the BGA OE payments. Aerospace margins expanded 50 basis points to 20.5% through the really good performance primarily due to productivity net of inflation and partially offset by investments for growth. Now Tim is going to talk more about this in March at the Investor Day but the investments we are making in quality pursuits are resulting in big platform wins and growth for the future.","Let's turn now to ACS on slide eight, automation and control. ACS sales were up 10% in the quarter, up 4% organic. They finished the year very strong with continued acceleration in the products businesses combined with strong orders in the solutions businesses. Let's just go through a little bit of color for the major components of ACS.","For ESS, for energy safety and security, the sales were up 18% reported, 5% organic, good growth in security, life safety and ECC as a result of the U.S. residential and retail chain strength, I mentioned earlier and that's been a theme obviously, new product introductions and also continued good geographic expansion at ACS. Process solutions sales were up 1% in the quarter, organic, with continued good services growth more than offsetting large project completions. However organic orders in the quarter were double-digit driving further backlog expansion at HPS and a robust project pipeline ahead. As we saw throughout 2013, HPS had strong sales conversion as a result of higher margin backlog and the benefits of prior period repositioning actions.","And finally for the building solutions and distribution business, BSD. Sales were up 4% organic driven by higher sales in our America Security Distribution business. While process solutions, BSD order rates grew double-digits in the quarter, primarily driven by a large energy win.","Moving to the margins, ACS was down, as expected 20 basis points to 15.3% in the quarter, again consistent with our planning assumption, primarily driven by the dilutive impact of Intermec acquisition and also the investments that ACS is making for growth partially offset by productivity net of inflation as well as ongoing repositioning benefits.","Now let's go to slide number nine, look at Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT. You can see sales for PMT were $1.7 billion in the quarter, up 12% reported, up 9% organic and above the high-end of our guidance range, driven primarily by strong results both, in UOP as well as in flooring products. This was also reflected the terrific segment profit growth, up 30% in the quarter for PMT.","Just a couple of the details starting with UOP, sales were up 24%, up 17% organic, driven by the addition of Thomas Russell and increased catalyst and gas processing sales, again, reflecting continued strong refining, petrochemical and gas end markets.","The advanced materials sales were up 4% versus the prior year, reflecting improved production volumes in Resins and Chemicals as well as foreign products resuming production in Metropolis.","Margins for PMT were up 210 basis points, primarily due to the strong volumes, but also productivity, again, partially offset by continued investments for growth. Obviously, another good year for PMT, strengthened UOP more than offsetting the challenging year that we had in Advanced Materials. Of course, again a reminder, we are investing in new capacity in UOP, and also transition our existing footprint to support new technologies in Advanced Materials.","Then just a couple highlights on Transportation Systems on Slide 10, a strong finish for TS. Sales growth accelerated up 15% organically in the fourth quarter, driven by new launches and also higher global Turbo gas penetration. Over the course of year, we have seen Europe stabilize with modest improvement as we exited the year with high EU light vehicle production up about 3% in the fourth quarter versus a very challenging fourth quarter 2012, you would recall when sales were down 8% organically. We also benefited from an uptick in China commercial vehicle demand, driven partially by Euro 3 pre-buy activity in anticipation of the new emissions standards in 2014.","Segment margins for TS expanded 250 basis points to 13.6%, primarily due to the strong material productivity and also volume leverage in Turbo.","Now let's turn to Slide 11, give you just an update and, again, a preview of 2014. We continue to expect sales in the $40.3 billion to $40.7 billion range for the full year, up 3% to 4% reported and approximately 3% organic. Again, this range is still predicated on a euro rate of roughly 1.30 at the high-end of the range closer to 1.35.","We also continue to expect segment margin expansion 30 basis points to 60 basis points up, or 50 basis points to 80 basis points, excluding M&A. Now, embedded in that guidance includes roughly 25 million of additional repositioning benefits spread across the portfolio in 2014 from the actions that we took in the fourth quarter 2013, those that we just reviewed with you.","We are increasingly confident as Dave said our EPS framework of 5.35 to $5.55, representing 8% to 12% growth over 2013. The full year growth linearity remains in line with our prior year results and the range also continues to be based on a full year tax rate of 26.5%. Now we are expecting $3.8 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, up low to mid-single digits, reflecting approximately $300 million of increased capital spending in 2014 compared to 2013.","Now, before we turn to the first quarter on the next slide, I just want to take a couple of minutes and talk about some of the bullet points on the bottom of this slide, talk about some of the key planning assumptions for the year.","As you can see, we are expecting roughly flat margins to start the year, driven by two things, the acquisition dilution associated with the Intermec acquisition and also low or high net margin Parex petrochemical catalyst shipments, in UOP, in the first quarter 2014 versus the very record shipments, the tremendous record shipments that we had and we enjoyed in the first quarter of '13. As we discussed earlier, we will have about $0.10 gain reflecting the B\/E shares sold in the first quarter which will be deployed for restructuring and other actions, so no net income or EPS impact anticipated from those actions. And as a result and as a reminder, although we announced a divestiture of friction materials, it remains in our full year sales and margin outlook for now and we will update you accordingly upon the close of the transaction but no significant impact to full year 2014 earnings guidance.","So with that background on the full-year, let's talk about the first quarter, little more details on the guide that I just referenced. This is on slide 12, we are expecting sales to be in the range of $9.6 billion to $9.8 billion, up 3% to 5% reported or 2% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be ex-M&A, up in the range of 20 to 40 basis points.","Let's look now at just highlights of each of the businesses, starting with Aero for the first quarter. We are expecting sales for Aero to be flat to slightly down with mid-single-digit growth in commercial offset by mid-single digit decline in defense. On the commercial OE we expect lower regional sales to be a drag on the ATR OE in Q1 as well as for the year offset by healthy demand for mid to large cabin business aircraft in the BGA OE. On the aftermarket are expecting ATR spares growth to be ahead of flight hours in the first quarter and the continued positive stories in terms of BGA RMUs to benefit the quarter as well as the full-year. As for margins, we expect a slight decline year-over-year in the first quarter for Aero primarily due to higher initial OE shipments due to new platform wins and higher mechanical OE sales in the quarter.","Aero margins are expected to pick up pace over the remainder of the year. For the first quarter, ACS sales are expected to be up 6% to 8%, 2% to 4% organically with low single digit organic growth across each of the three businesses. Now the macro environment is obviously looking moderately better as we start 2014 for ACS and we continue to see residential strength as well as modest improvement in the non-resi markets. On the strong growths we saw at the end of 2013 for ACS, both in the short and the long cycle, gives us obviously increasing confidence. And due to the acquisition dilution, the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be flattish with margins again improving over the course the year driven by good growth as well as productivity.","PMT is expecting sales in the first quarter to be up 4% to 6% building on a terrific first quarter 2013 as well as obviously the strong performance we had in 2011 and '12 with PMT. We are expecting another quarter of sales growth in UOP but as a reference the mix of shipments for UOP in the quarter will result in a headwind for the margin rate for PMT. The advanced materials are expecting flattish sales primarily driven by unfavorable price raw spreads in R&C and lower R-22 pricing in floorings which is why our new Solstice product suite is so important as it ramps up over the coming years. Now, as you know, PMT is also continuing to run at full capacity levels at many of its plant and will start to benefit from increased capacity in 2015 but particularly pickup in 2016 on that front.","In transportation systems, expecting more the same, with sales in the first quarter up 5% to 7% driven by new platform launches, continued Turbo gas and diesel penetration and also increased European light vehicle production rates on a year-over-year basis. We expect TS margins to be up approximately 250 basis points, primarily from volume leverage in Turbo as well as productivity gains.","EPS for Honeywell first quarter, we expect to be in the range of $1.23 to $1 27, up 6% to 10% year-over-year when you normalize for the effective tax rate using our full year expected rate of 26.5% and again consistent with our normal EPS linearity profile.","So now let's move to slide 13 and just summarize before turning it back over to Elena for Q&A. So obviously 2013 is behind us. We have demonstrated once again we can deliver on our commitments, despite limited help from a macro environment. It's a big reminder of the value of the diversified and balanced portfolio, the strength of the positioning of that portfolio as well as the strength of the Honeywell playbook. We set, we met high expectations, particularly as it relates to margin expansion and earnings growth. All of the businesses as Dave said, executed well with margins expanding in every business in 2013.","We achieved this while maintaining our focus in investment for the future, doing the smart things that are going to deliver value for years to come. As we said before, we are planning for more of the same in 2014, modest top line growth, but strong margin expansion. We feel more confident in our outlook based on the signs of stability and the pockets of improvement in both, the number of short and long cycle businesses, but nothing as Dave said, again at this time suggest anything less than conservative planning is prudent.","The playbook is working. Our operating initiatives are having many landings in terms of results they are yielding, setting up discernible multi-year tailwind. Seed planting and repositioning benefits has become a hallmark of our execution story, we are investing in more profitable growth as well as asset efficiency. As you can see now, we have significant restructuring savings in the bank for 2015.","In summary, we are excited about what the year 2014 entails. We knew that the finish line of the last five-year plan set back in 2010, we have got a lot of momentum across the portfolio leading up to our March 5 Investor Day. We will be updating you there on our framework for 2014, unveiling our new five-year targets out for 2018, and also providing roadmaps by business on how each SPG president plans to drive for more profitable growth through more innovation and execution.","With that summary, Elena, let's go over to you for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Great. Zack, if you can open the line? We will take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Guys, one of the numbers that you gave China up, 13%, I think that's the best quarter you had China and gosh, I think it's been quite a while. I mean what, can you give us some granularity? I don't think many of your competitors are going to see anything close to that, so what's working for you in China and what's the visibility? I mean, is there a turn there in the businesses you are selling into or is this more a short-term?","David Cote","Things feel pretty good for us in China, Scott. We did pretty well. If you take a look at the total year and the fourth quarter, and when we take a look at our short cycle order rates, they are also looking pretty robust and it's pretty much across the board, across all the businesses, and I really think it has a lot to do with the focus we have on becoming the Chinese competitor. This makes us a lot more local in everything we do and I think that's an economy that's going to continue to grow and grow for a long time, and we have just been working very hard at positioning ourselves there to be successful.","Scott Davis - Barclays","I guess the natural follow-up to that is just that is this more of Honeywell specific or do you think that you are seeing actual turn in the overall industrial macro in China?","David Cote","I guess, I would break it into the two pieces. I am not sure always how reliable all those statistics are when you see industrial production and that kind of thing out of China, so whether it's really good or really bad on the statistics. I think some of that was a bit of a grain of salt. Overall though, I would say we still see it growing, and within that we are growing better, so I think it's a combination of the two.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Fair enough. Then, you guys just talked a little bit about Turbo. It's always been a great business, and you have grown above market, I think something in the neighborhood of, call it, 7% or something over production vehicle numbers, but we will hit an inflection point here where you can outgrow those historic levels, just because the CAF\u00c9 standards and such globally are all picking up to such aggressive numbers pretty quickly, can we start to think about Turbo as being a higher growth than 7% plus, you know, global SAAR or is this what you saw in the quarter more of a short-term temporary?","David Anderson","I am not sure what number I would put on the overall growth, Scott, but I would say as we said in last year's investor presentation, there is explosive growth possible in our Turbo business for a number of reasons. One is exactly what you said about the increasing standards around the world. The second is that a Turbo is one of the easiest, least, technologically difficult things for any OEM to do in order to achieve those standards. There is a lot of more complex stuff they can do, but Turbo, they are pretty well known, pretty well understood. I think that penetration rate is going to continue and we are uniquely advantaged within that space because we have a jet engine business, and that jet engine business allow just stuff like Material Science, Airflow Handling to be shared with the Turbocharger, because the Turbo is really just a small jet engine. So again I would say, it's the combination of the two. That market is going to continue to grow very well, but we will also grow very well within that market because of our capability.","Scott Davis - Barclays","That's fair enough. Okay, I will pass it off. Congrats on a good year, guys.","David Cote","Thanks.","David Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks. Good morning, Dave, Dave and Elena. Nice close to 2013.","David Anderson","Thank you.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Let me start with just the growth investments that you referenced in most of the business units. Can you give us any kind of - excluding the repositioning to see operating expense impact maybe in total or some sense for sizing how big they were this quarter?","David Cote","I guess, I\u2019ve got it off the top of my head. It's a decent size number.","David Anderson","If you look at it across the business, and here we are really talking about, Steve, obviously we are talking about growth investments and so you have to keep up that the investments part of that in quote, because it\u2019s really P&L but it's really building for the future. So, it's a combination of R&D new product. The whole new product process, introduction process, CapEx, and the flow through of depreciation related to that CapEx, it's the expansion, feet on the street in terms of high growth region as well as just as you know, just the over continued investment we are making in terms of sales and marketing capabilities and engineering capabilities. It's about 50 basis points.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","David Anderson","When you think about the total of that.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that's helpful, and I suppose in March we will get more detail not just anecdotes around traction, I mean as you mentioned, you have been making these investments for years now on a relative performance versus direct competitors and peers. I think that would be helpful because it is often something we hear about.","The second one is on the repositioning projects themselves, maybe give us a little sense for where you are directing us? I think it's no longer FrictionMaterials. Where is it going and what kind of things are you are you doing? Is it Intermec? Is it M&A oriented or where investors often wonder, is this the end of it for Honeywell from a repositioning standpoint, maybe give us a little flavor for what you are finding?","David Cote","First I would say, if you noticed that it\u2019s really spread across the businesses where we have done a lot of this. And the nice thing I like about it is, we still see lots of opportunity to be able to improve our operations. As you know, our margin rates are still lower than our, say high margin rate peers, and that's all upside for us as we continue to make the company more efficient. So the restructuring is pretty much spread amongst the businesses.","David Anderson","I think Dave just to add to that, and Steve, we talked about this. You are aware of this. I mean, the whole ideation, if you will, the development of projects and the pipeline of projects is something that we take very, very seriously, and it's something that's not a stop\/start. This is a continual good process in terms of really looking for those opportunities to really set a new bar, if you will, in terms of the performance of the businesses.","The other thing is, it's really consistent with, and we talked about, just a continued expansion and the growth of the global footprint of the company, really realizing the opportunity that exists in terms of the GDP, the GDP growth globally. So all of that functional transformation. It's amazing the things that we continue to do in terms of really a rethinking our model for support, both the service levels and the quality levels and the cost levels in FT.","Just this past year I was working with Dave on the functions, it's amazing, the amount of things that you could consider to be still sort of breakthrough. Those all represent repositioning opportunities. We view that very, very positively, we are obviously strategic in our thinking and then very good we think in terms of execution by actually delivering on those results. We take that very seriously as well in terms of the ongoing tracking and management of these projects. It's something you ought to count on from us.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Right. In light of the volume growth that we are starting to talk about, I assume your capacity utilization levels are low enough at this point that there is not a lot of CapEx coming other than what we just talked about for UOP and specific projects on that front.","David Anderson","Yes. It's largely a PMT issue to your point, not much of an issue in the other businesses.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great, and I will pass it on. thanks.","David Anderson","Okay.","Operator","We will go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Good morning. Maybe you program (Inaudible) say great quarter, so we are going to have to say it at every conference call here.","David Cote","I don't mind.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","On the fluorine side, you mentioned the incremental headwinds in the first quarter. I mean, it's a not a huge part of your business and I think pricing has stabilized there. In fact, I think one of your main competitors talked about raising price earlier this year. Maybe could you talk about, with the volatility and price there, or even though it's small, what kind of impact it's had on you in the last year and what kind of impact you think it's that's going to have and maybe qualify it in the first quarter and then am I right in kind of viewing the second half as there's a much easier kind of price comp on fluorine or does it get worse from here?","David Cote","I obviously don't want to comment on anything anybody else is saying about it. I would say though that we did degradation in the course of last year, largely because non-patent related product and this is a game where you got to be able to have really unique stuff and that's the advantage we have.","Once we are able to start producing that and introducing it, then we will be in that much better a shape. I don't know that we have actually set quarter-by-quarter how much it affects us, but we did feel and in fact last year I don't expect to see a huge decrement again this year.","David Anderson","Just to add to, Dave, to what you have said, and we referenced a meaningful headwind for us in the first quarter and it's measureable in terms of impact, so that is something that's going to moderate in terms of headwind in the first quarter. It happened to be paired timing-wise with also the headwind that we got out of UOP in terms of Parex shipments when we really had for the first quarter, where we really had just a rollout you recall first quarter 2013","By the way, that first quarter 2013, as I referenced when I went through my remarks, was also on top of a very strong first quarter '11 and in the first quarter '12. In 2014, we have a little bit of sort of the confluence of events with both, UOP fall into little bit in Resins and Chemicals and it is related to the phenomena, Steve, that you mentioned and then basically that moderates then over the course of 2014.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Is it a r22 or a 410a issue?","David Cote","It's largely r22.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, so this is really the volatility. I mean, you had a spike in the price, so that should normalize. Is it about like (Inaudible) third of the year-over-year comp to down 150 in margins?","David Cote","In terms of headwind that we are going to have from PMT in the first quarter, due to phenomena I just mentioned. By the way, the other headwind we have as I talked about was ACS, which is well known in terms of the acquisition, in terms of margin rate. I am just talking margin rate. It's, say, about a third of the of impact in terms of the PMT phenomena.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. That's great, and one last question before the March meeting here. I mean, you guys are kind of putting up the low double-digit, low-teens growth. I mean, you are kind managing a pretty well to that number. It seems like you guys are a little more optimistic on the economy, which would suggest that maybe at the end of the day that 12% to 13% consisting EPS growth is not really be that much of a standout outperformance.","I mean, at what point do you kind of look out in a better economy see peers growing maybe 15% plus and think about maybe doing something a little more to get that growth rate up or do we still have kind of the mentality that look it is going to click away and do, we think, over a five-year period and above average type of growth rate? Is there any discussion as to that high level approach to the business model?","David Cote","Well, I would say, Steve, there is always obviously a big difference between actual and forecast. And when you are trying to forecast out for five years, its one thing to just put a really bullish economic scenario behind it, it is another to say, okay we want to make sure that we can do whatever it is that we say that we are going to do. I would rely though that, if we take a look at how we done on actual, historically we have always done very well when it came to actual, especially worse is our forecast.","If we say, okay we have got plan to grow a certain percent over the next five years and the economy is significantly better than what we expected, that certainly won't be holding ourselves to that as a maximum, rather we are going to continue to be focused on how do we outperform our peers every quarter, every year, just like we have in the past. So I wouldn't get too hung up on a forecast that how bullish is the macro forecast for the economy. I am certainly hopeful that it ends up better than what I tend to think it is going to be but it is showing signs of some life now. I don't know that we are going to see a really robust economy over the next five years but you just don't know. No matter what happens, it will be our intent to outperform on the actual.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David Cote","You are welcome.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David Cote","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Hi, Dave. One way to get at that question is that it kind of looks like the cabbage path is really slowing up.","David Cote","Well, we have done a lot of seed planting. There is a lot cabbage to be picked up. I agree with you.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","So, I mean, obviously you are not going to announce deals here today or anything but how active is the M&A pipeline and where is your head on share repurchase? Obviously you have got the $5 billion authorization you put out there. Its not clear that you are going to really aggressively move against that though.","David Cote","Well, I think hacking back to the comment Dave just made on restructuring and how we keep a pretty full pipeline. We do the same thing when it comes to M&A, looking at what's available, what's possible, how do we continue to do what we call our milk runs, and just calling on companies and heard me liken it to being at a retail business where you sit there and from 10:00 to 2:00, nobody shows up and then at 2:00 for some reason seven people come it at the same time and you wonder why it wasn't spread out during the day.","Well. the same thing happens with M&A deals. Sometimes they come in a bunch like they did nine, ten months ago and sometimes you go a year-and-half without much happening. So its tough to predict. So if you are focused on making smart deals like we continue to do, then it is probably going to keep coming in bunches, because I never say, okay, we have got to deploy $2 billion a year or anything like that. I want to make sure that we continue to say, stay smart about this.","That being said, there is just a whole lot of opportunity for us when it comes to M&A. It's a big world out there and we look at the possibilities for great positions in good industries, building off the portfolio we have. There's still a lot of good stuff out there. So we are going to continue looking. When it comes to repurchases, I want that in our quiver as the things that we could be doing. We are going to continue to at least hold share count flat. Its my intent to do that.","So. I want to make sure that we are a little more opportunistic when it comes to it. I am always fearful of falling into that 80% that buys at the wrong time and I would like make sure that we fall into the 20% that looks like, wow, that was a really smart thing to do. I think timing does make a difference there and we will continue to think about it that way. So I still see a lot of M&A potential and I think we have proven over the years that we are reasonably good at it.","David Anderson","Okay, another thing to add. If you just look at 2013 and this is another, I think, kudos for the company, you look at 2013, we had $1.1 billion in terms of share buyback. Te had roughly the same number in terms of M&A. Dividend, we paid out $1.4 billion rounds. $1.375 billion roughly, $1.4 billion. This is very strong performance and I think if you look at the track record of Honeywell, what we have been able to deliver, not only operationally but in terms of, as Dave said, smart capital deployment. Smart deals we thought. If you go back to 2005 Nomar transaction, the UOP transaction, go forward in terms of what we have done in terms of building on a position in gas detection, our safety products business.","The growth now and AIDC Scanning and Mobility. These are all very, very smart adds that lend themselves to further both, organic and inorganic growth. Thomas Russell add to UOP.","As Dave said, the pipeline is rich. There is always the distance between the cup and the lip. In M&A, it's very tough to move from concept to actually close, but what we have done has been very successful and the track record is well balanced in our capital deployment. 50% of our cash over the last 10 years deployed to build the business into CapEx or M&A, 50% back to shareholders either in the form of dividend or share buyback, so we are just going to continue to be smart about it. We think that disciplined approach pays out over time together with the operating discipline and the operating performance.","David Anderson","Jeff, I like everything that Dave just said with one exception I might modify and correct his pronunciation of the word smart.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Interesting.","David Anderson","I think I would learn that through for all these years.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Smart in China.","David Anderson","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Dave, I also just asked that question on the context of situation what it looks like you maybe could be net cash by the end of the year. You are going out a new five-year target right, I doubt if you are modeling the recession. Perhaps, you are, but if you are going to grow earnings 10%, 12%, 13% in next five years, that's going to be a (Inaudible).","David Anderson","Jeff, I am well aware of the cash that we have on the balance sheet.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Then just finally, Dave Anderson, said each asking you would lay out target for more profitable growth, so currently is you are going to project higher (Inaudible) are there any particular areas that actually standout as being on target form the margin standpoint?","David Anderson","I think, Dave, really it's across.","David Anderson","Yes. We see upside, maybe it should be one of the businesses, Jeff.","David Cote","The pattern of that, Jeff, will vary just as the pattern varies by quarter in 2014, vary by business, by year based up on their individual growth outlooks, if you will to make up the long cycle short cycle, all of those factors are going to influence, but when you look at the overall five-year numbers as Dave said, we think are very positive for all the businesses.","David Anderson","By the way, Jeff, just a compliment for you, we were really amused by your phrase. A pretty typical street forecasting, well done.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Yes. It's 23% every year, right? Have a good day. Talk to you later.","David Anderson","Nice. Thank you.","Operator","We will go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Good morning. Thank you very much. A couple of things. One is, on Thomas Russell. It looks like the numbers were sequentially about the same and how is it doing? Can you kind of provide an update for us, please?","David Anderson","On Thomas Russell? It's doing well.","David Cote","I would say between their capability and ours, extremely complimentary in market, technology and sales outreach and even manufacturing, so quite good.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Year-over-year or you are still lacking high, what I would call a 10%, 30% growth rate?","David Cote","I don't that we disclose it.","Elena Doom","No. I think, you can comment though. It's not that level hard.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","You can see part of it below the line, Dave, so that's why -","Elena Doom","Fully integrated in (Inaudible)\u2026","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","All right. I will leave that.","David Cote","You are correct. It's doing well.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Then in terms of Aerospace, new products, I think that there has been a number of them in terms of synthetic vision and in terms of some other things in term of integrating the cockpit. Mike, you talked about them and sort of what's your finding as you (Inaudible)?","David Cote","I am not sure what you are looking for specifically there, Howard, but yes. We do have a pile of new products coming out of the Aero business, some of which they have talked about, some of which they haven't and so far so good, things are going well.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And one of course is all the connectivity things that you have got, (inaudible), maybe you can provide an update on some of that. That's where I was going, though.","David Cote","Okay. Well, you can expect us to talk more about that on Investor Day, because you are correct. We think that's the place that we excel and we see continuing to increase.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Oaky. Thank you very much.","David Cote","You are welcome, Howard.","Elena Doom","We have time for one more question.","Operator","We will take our last question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David Cote","Hi, John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Commercial aftermarket, just wondering what the trend and cadence of the business is. You had pretty robust results and from competitors and chatter about some inventory restock and you guys are going to be rolling into, you actually have these in your compares this quarters. You seem to have easier compares on the segment. As the course of the year unfolds, why don't you talk to the compares towards what is the cadence of that business.","David Cote","I assume you are talking about Aero, John?","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Yes, I am sorry, commercial aerospace aftermarket.","David Cote","We think that's something that starts to get a little bit better this year than it was last year overall.","Elena Doom","Specifically, John, to put some perspective on it, we had something shifting, numbers. If you look back at the fourth quarter of 2012. We did start to see the impact of aircraft dismantling and asset pooling and that really pulled down in the developed economies, their spare sales. For example, U.S. spares in the fourth quarter of 2012 were down over 20%. Obviously this is partially offset by what we talked about a year ago, a bit of a pull-forward in buying behavior out of China. So in the fourth quarter of 2012, our China spares were up over 40%. So now, if we fast forward to 2013, in the fourth quarter we did see a return of more normal buying behavior across almost all of the geographies but in particular, you see the U.S. rebounding nicely, up over 20%, while China spare sales increased sequentially, though they are still facing that difficult comp and I think about 10% within the quarter. So moving forward to 2014, we do expect the ATR aftermarket there to grow in the first quarter in excess of flight hours as a result of the easier comp and obviously more normal buying behavior.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And that obviously pertains to prospectively better margins in the second as the year unfolds, if I am reading that right.","David Anderson","I think that's fine.","Elena Doom","Okay.","David Anderson","And maybe a way to summarize all of that is to say that the guidance is the same which is, we are looking at mid single digit growth in the commercial aftermarket for aerospace in 2014.","Elena Doom","For the year.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Can I ask you about transportation. I think European light vehicle in the first quarter was down in terms of production, down double-digit. Why is the number, I realize it's a little bit of currency headwind, but given the strength of transportation in the fourth quarter, the momentum you seem to have, why is your guide still where it is? Why 3% to 5%? Why isn't it up a little bit higher for '14?","David Anderson","You are talking about TS in total?","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Yes. Correct.","David Anderson","I guess, it's the moderating effect of friction plus there is, let's say, a conservatism on our part when it comes to what's going to happen in Europe. So we think its bottomed at this point and that's why we are starting to see increases as new launches more than offset the slight declines but its just more a case of just wanting to not get too far off on this one.","David Cote","Currency also has a big impact there, but the assumption that we make, when using, as you recall, John, we are using a 1.30 Euro to Dollars. So that has a little bit of a headwind effect to TS. It's largely non-U.S., today, business. So that does have an influence as well.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Well, is there any sort of rate to your assumption that perhaps maybe the rebound you are seeing light vehicle consumption in Europe is perhaps little bit short-term duration or is there something else? I am just trying to, is this anything more than conservatism, I guess is what I am going after?","Elena Doom","Well, John, I would point out that, in the fourth quarter, we did see very strong buying behavior in China. Dave referenced this in his opening comments. So there is some free buy ahead of some potential regulation changes on emission that certainly bode very well for the TS sales in China in the quarter. So we are not anticipating that that will repeat.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","David Cote","And I am also hopeful that its conservatism on our part.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","I get it. I am just making sure there is nothing else in the mix that has (inaudible).","David Cote","There is nothing bad.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Just one more quick one then. It's a little bit of back to the M&A question. Dave Anderson had set a $1 billion placeholder for this year, and you kind it kind of make sense as a placeholder. I just want to know, Dave Cote, how are you thinking about perhaps the prospects given the strength of your balance sheet toward - if the opportunity came along doing say a mid-year deal in ACS or something that could sort of build up the success of Intermec and some of these other deals have done or do you really sort of see '14 at this juncture still kind of a pretty much a bolt-on year?","David Cote","John, I would go back to what I said earlier. It's tough to know. We look at small stuff, we look at the bigger stuff and you just never know when something is all of a sudden become actionable and I don't want to ever commit certain amount every year, because it's not necessarily the way deals come in, but I could tell you we are very interested in M&A, because I think we have proven we are good at it.","Where, it's focused on doing a good job with it today as we were 10 years ago, because it's not an area where we ever want to make a mistake, so who knows? I would just say that I have a predilection for doing M&A, because I think we are good at it and it's a way for us to really add value.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","I understand, but, Dave, would you prefer to do a bigger deal if the opportunity arose because of the success you have had or do you think the smaller bolt-on framework is really still the playbook we should think about?","David Cote","I guess it depends on how we define bigger deal, because I am not favoring one or the other. At the end of the day, I just want to do good deals and I would rather do 10 $200 million really good deals than to do a $2 billion average deal.","By the same token, if there is a $2 billion, really good deal. I am certainly not going to sit here going well, that's too big. I don't want to do that, so it's got to be on a case-by-case basis.","The thing I can promise you is, no matter how this ends up evolving or developing, I will be able to make a strong case to you on why we can make good money on this focused on cost synergies, not counting on sales synergies and it will be a great position in a good industry.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much. See you in March.","Elena Doom","All right, Dave. Do you have any final comments?","David Cote","Of course. We certainly like what we have accomplished, and not just in this quarter, of course. While that does feel good, what feels even better is what we can see coming as we continue to outperform. I got to say it's been very fulfilling to complete our first five-year plan with panache even in a weaker than expected macro economy.","That being said, as I say a lot and my team has heard me say a lot, yesterday's press clippings wrap today's fish. We intend to continue outperforming for a long time and the seed planting that we have done for several years now puts us in a great position to make that happen.","We continue to look forward and we look forward to sharing our next five-year plan with you at our March Investor Day. Thanks for listening.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day."],"10786":["Honeywell International, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Christina and good morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements in this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance and our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter, share our guidance for the fourth quarter, and full year 2017 and as always we will leave ample time at the end for your questions. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. As we previewed last week Honeywell delivered another terrific quarter with strong organic sales growth and margin expansion leading to high quality earnings. Sales were up 5% exceeding the high end of the guidance we provided in July. Our aerospace aftermarket business grew more than 7%, our Intelligrated business which developed solutions for the warehouse automation market continued to grow at double-digit pace and every business and performance materials and technologies grew considerably led by 25% organic sales growth in UOP.","In addition we saw a continued strength in high growth regions. Organic sales growth in both China and India was up more than 30% year-over-year driven by strong catalyst demand in UOP and continued growth from our differentiated offering within the home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions. We expanded segment margins by a 120 basis points this quarter driven by strong operational performance in all businesses leading to earnings per share that came in at the high end of our guidance range of $1.75 up 16% on a basis consistent for our guidance. During the quarter we also funded about 120 million of restructuring and other projects. We remain on track to achieving our full year free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the quarter was 1.2 billion representing about 90% conversion. I am encouraged by the progress we made with regard to working capital but there is much more we can do and all of our businesses are focused on driving improvements to our cash cycle.","Overall I am pleased with our organic sales growth momentum and the operational improvement each of our businesses continue to achieve. As a result of our continued outperformance last week we raised our full year earnings per share guidance to $7.05 to $7.10 up 9% to 10%. As you will hear shortly this morning we also raised our full year sales guidance to reflect the stronger top line performance. Tom will walk you through those updates in a few minutes. As most of you may recall last week announced the spins of Homes and Transportation Systems. As independent companies Homes and Transportation Systems will be better positioned to make tailored, strategic, and capital decisions that enable long-term value creation. At the same time these actions will make Honeywell a more focused, growth oriented, and synergistic company putting us in a better position to continue to deliver the results you've come to expect from us. I am pleased with this quarter's results and looking forward to a strong finish to 2017. ","Let's turn to slide 3 to discuss some of the commercial progress our business has made in the third quarter. In aerospace we launched a new unmanned aerial vehicle inspection service called Honeywell InView. The service will help customers in the utility, energy, infrastructure, and oil and gas industries improve critical structure inspections while eliminating safety hazards for employees. InView combines the proven performance of Intel's Falcon 8+ UAV system and Honeywell's varied and extensive experience across verticals whose data driven software will help customers log, analyze, and eventually predict or prevent outages and structural failures. We're excited about this unique combination of cutting edge aeronautics with software data. ","In Home and Building Technologies Kuala Lumpur International Airport, one of Asia's major aviation hubs selected Honeywell Building Solutions to upgrade its airfield ground lighting control and monitoring system. The Honeywell system will enhance safety and efficiency while accommodating increasing aircraft traffic. Honeywell Technology will provide real time location information on light failures to optimize response and repair, promoting enhanced operations and improved uptime.","Performance Materials and Technologies announced that Kuwait Paraxylene Production Company will use Honeywell Connected Plant services to improve performance at its CCR Platforming and aromatics complex which produces a precursor to plastic fibers and films. KPPC will use Honeywell Connected Plants Process Reliability Advisor for ongoing monitoring early event detection and mitigation of performance issues before they become costly. The company will also use Process Optimization Advisor which continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies Honeywell UOP process models to determine the most cost effective mode of operations. Both services use big data analytics and machine learning to improve plan operation. We continued to deliver results for our customers through our Connected Plant offerings and I'm pleased with the traction beginning in this area.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions you will recall our efforts to develop mobile computing offerings for Google's android operating system which is quickly becoming the standard for industrial handheld devices. I'm pleased to announce that earlier this week we launched the Mobility Edge Platform. Mobility Edge allows users to easily upgrade to future Android versions more than any competitive offerings in the market making it easier for customers to manage device refreshes and quickly deploy apps. We have conducted comprehensive voice of the customer research prior to the development of the Mobility Edge platform and rethought our approach to solving customer pain points that come up during our conversations. The result -- this results in a best in class scalable platform that makes deployments quick and easy for our customers. Clearly there are lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio as we head into 2018. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss our results.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks Darius, good morning, I'm on slide 4. As Darius mentioned we achieved 5% organic sales growth in the third quarter which exceeded our guidance of 2% to 4% growth. We've met or exceeded the high end of our sales guidance in every quarter of 2017 and each of our businesses is contributing to the momentum. Segment profit was 1.9 billion up 13% excluding the impact from our 2016 divestitures and segment margin expanded 120 basis points from 2016 driven by our continued focus on effective selling and operational execution. ","We also had some favorability from lower OEM incentives in aerospace which was contemplated in our guidance. Earnings per share was $1.75 in line with our preview on October 10th. Our third quarter tax rate came in at 23.4% lower than originally anticipated which enabled additional restructuring projects beyond what we had planned. These projects will improve our cost structure, drive further productivity starting in the fourth quarter, and begin to address the residual costs we expect as a result of the announcements. Excluding 60 million of this additional restructuring and earnings from our 2016 divestitures and normalized for tax at 26% in both periods, earnings per share was up 16% year-over-year. ","A number of people have asked about the impact from the extreme weather throughout the third quarter. The impact from all of the weather issues was approximately $0.02 of earnings which we were able to overcome with advanced planning and other mitigation actions. Each of our businesses was impacted in some way. We had to temporarily close six aerospace sites in the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, several ADI branches were closed leading to loss revenues for Home and Building Technologies. In Process Solutions several customers pushed third quarter projects into the fourth quarter and SPS experienced lower demand for safety equipment especially gas sensing products due to refinery maintenance push outs. We're proud of how our employees and management team responded and delivered despite these challenges and are pleased that all of our employees made it through the event safely. We're in the process of assessing any ongoing impact to our business. ","Free cash flow continues to be strong growing 18% year-to-date despite about 200 million more of timing related cash tax payments this quarter and about 500 million more year-to-date. As Darius mentioned, our focus on improving working capital is beginning to deliver results and we expect this to continue into 2018 and beyond. Free cash flow conversion in the third quarter was about 90% as Darius mentioned. Overall we delivered high quality results driven by strong operational performance in our businesses. ","Let's turn to slide 5 for our segment results. Starting with aerospace, sales growth was two percentage points above the high end of our guidance. Strength in the commercial after market continued this quarter with strong air transport and regional spares and continued demand for retrofits, modifications, and upgrades. The business in general aviation aftermarket was also up primarily driven by the timing of customer demand. Overall aftermarket sales grew 7%. OE sales for the quarter were up 10% driven by the impact of lower year-over-year customer incentives as expected. On the air transport side we saw higher demand on key platforms including the A318, A320, and 737, strong growth with certain regional OEM's as well. ","Sales and business in general aviation were better than anticipated primarily due to the timing of engines and avionic shipments and accelerated new platform demand. While we are encouraged by the strong quarter in BGA, the market is not expected to fully recover until late next year or early in 2019. Defense and space sales were down 2% organic with strong U.S. core defense sales more than offset by storm related impacts, supply based execution, and the anticipated continued weakness in the space and commercial helicopter markets. ","In Transportation Systems we saw a continued growth in commercial vehicles particularly for on-highway turbos driven by increased vehicle sales in the U.S., new launches in Europe, and continued enforcement of vehicle weight regulations in China. Growth in light vehicle gas turbos in China was again strong. Aerospace segment margin expansion of 290 basis points for the quarter was driven by lower year-over-year customer incentives as we signaled, commercial excellence including the impact of our investments in the sales force, the benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives, and the favorable impact of the 2016 divestiture of the government services business. ","Home and Building Technologies grew 2% driven by distribution and the smart energy business within products. The distribution side of the business was up 2% primarily on the strength in our ADI business. Backlog in the Honeywell Building Solutions business was up over 20% in the quarter with every region reporting double-digit increases and every line of business up year-over-year. Within the products businesses we continue to execute several large smart meter program roll outs and saw continued strong demand for clean air and water products in China. Segment margin for HPT expanded 10 basis points driven by benefits from commercial excellence and our ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset by continued unfavorable mix both within the products businesses and between products and distribution. ","Performance Materials and Technology has had another outstanding quarter with organic sales up 10% and 170 basis points of margin expansion. There is broad strength across the PMT businesses. UOP sales were up 25% with every line of business achieving double-digit year-over-year increases including strong licensing, equipment, catalyst, and gas processing volumes. There was good growth in mega-projects in China, strong catalysts reload volumes in India and Asia-Pac, and new unit growth in the Middle East. In HPS sales were up 5% with significant growth in the short cycle software and services businesses as well as in thermal solutions. ","Advanced materials had another quarter of strong growth driven by continued demand for Solstice, low global warming products. Orders and backlog were up high single-digits across the entire PMT portfolio. Margin expansion in PMT came in at the high-end of our guidance range driven by the volume leverage from PMT's exceptional sales growth, results from our commercial excellence efforts, and the divestiture of the former resins and chemical business last year. ","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, organic sales were up 3%. Intelligrated booked a record amount of orders in the third quarter and had another quarter of 20% sales growth driven by strong demand from large customers. Workflow solutions recorded double-digit growth this quarter with significant demand coming from existing customers of our Vocollect voice unable solutions as well as a large project rollout for key European customer within our Movilizer software business. In Sensing and IoT demand for our sensing controls and new sensor product remained strong with control -- with growth in all regions particularly in high growth regions like China. In Productivity Products we saw double-digit growth within our scanning business as well as robust demand for printers. And as Darius mentioned we're working to address the Android based gaps in our mobility product line. We anticipate that we'll see the impact of our new Android launches next year. ","Finally Safety grew 1% on an organic basis driven by demand for our high risk and general safety personal protective equipment offerings. Again we were modestly impacted in Safety by the hurricanes in the quarter mostly in the gas sensing lines and fully expect a recovery in the fourth quarter. SPS segment margins expanded 190 basis points excluding the first year dilutive impacts from M&A primarily driven by higher volumes, continued productivity and restructuring benefits, and partially offset by investments in commercial excellence. A great third quarter performance across all the businesses as Darius mentioned while overcoming unanticipated impacts from the weather related disruptions. ","Slide 6 walks our earnings per share from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2017. Earnings from our divestitures in the third quarter were approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. We exclude those amounts from the 2016 baseline consistent with our guidance framework. For comparison purposes we have also normalized the tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 to the 26% effective tax rate we assumed in our third quarter guidance, the impact of which was $0.05 per share. As you can see the overwhelming majority of our earnings growth is coming from segment profit improvement in the business with all four segments contributing to the growth led by aerospace. This reflects the impacts from the strong top line in the quarter as well as our commercial excellence efforts in HOS Gold deployment and savings from previously executed restructuring projects. ","Below the line items were at $0.02 head win this quarter primarily due to the absence of the third quarter 2016 gain from the sale of our former aerospace government services business partially offset by slightly lower restructuring expense year-over-year. In the third quarter we funded nearly 120 million of restructuring which was partially enabled by a lower than planned tax rate at approximately 23%. Other items including non-controlling interest, share count, and tax were roughly flat year-over-year. ","Let's turn to slide 7 for our expectations on the fourth quarter. In aerospace organic sales are expected to be up 1% to 3%. In commercial OE we expect roughly flat sales growth in total driven by strong air transport deliveries partially offset by the impact of declining shipments on legacy air transport platforms and slight declines in BizJet OE. We anticipate modest growth in the business aviation aftermarket on the timing of customer demand for spares and expect the air transport after market to be roughly flat driven by increased repair and overhaul activities offset by the timing of spares demand. ","In defense we have a healthy backlog and expect continued strength in U.S. core defense partially offset by ongoing space weakness. Demand for gas turbos in Europe is expected to drive low to mid single-digit growth in transportation systems. Aerospace margins should expand by 70 to 90 basis points this quarter driven by volume leverage, commercial excellence, restructuring benefits, and productivity net of inflation. In HPT we anticipate organic sales growth of 2% to 3%. Within the products businesses growth in smart energy will continue albeit at a slower pace as we move past the large smart meter rollout we executed in the second and third quarters.","We also anticipate improvement within security and fire. Security was improved each quarter in 2017 and we expect that to continue as a result of new product introductions and commercial excellence. In distribution the strong building solutions backlog I mentioned earlier combined with the continued strength in the global distribution business will drive low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. HPT segment margins are expected to contract 10 to 30 basis points driven by continued head wins from product mix partially offset by saving some prior restructuring actions and ongoing commercial excellence and productivity initiatives. ","As a reminder Smart Energy was recently moved from HPT to Performance Materials and Technologies and their results will be included in PMT's results beginning with the fourth quarter earnings. Before our December outlook we expect to file Form 8-K with the SEC to restate the 2016 and 2017 quarterly segment results to reflect this movement of the Smart Energy business. In Performance Materials and Technologies sales are expected to be up 10% to 12% on an organic basis driven by continued conversion to sales of our strong backlog. UOP is expected to deliver another quarter of strong growth driven by natural gas recovery projects in the UOP Russell business in Russia and North America as well as strong initial catalyst loads in the Middle East. ","We expect mid single-digit growth in HPS with significant demand for our thermal solutions and field instruments. In Advanced Materials we expect double-digit growth fueled primarily by our Solstice refrigerants for mobile air conditioning. PMT segment margins are expected to contract 110 to 120 basis points driven by an unfavorable mix of equipment versus catalyst sales in UOP year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2016 PMT had catalyst growth of 17% which fueled expansion of more than 500 basis points of margin. Even so for the full year we expect PMT will still generate 140 basis points of margin expansion, truly an outstanding year. ","In Safety and Productivity Solutions sales are expected to be up 5% to 7% on an organic basis. In the safety business we expect robust growth as refinery maintenance resumes following the hurricane related impacts in the third quarter which will drive demand for our entire range of safety products. We expect that the retail business will return to growth this quarter as we execute the new direct selling strategy in that business and expect we'll see normal elevated seasonal demand. Growth and productivity products will be driven by another strong quarter at Intelligrated building on the robust orders and backlog growth throughout 2017 as well as continued strong demand for the Sensing and Controls business and Workflow Solutions including Vocollect and Movilizer. ","SPS margins are expected to expand by 110 to 130 basis points driven primarily by higher volumes and the results from our ongoing productivity and repositioning effort. For Honeywell in total we expect another strong quarter of organic sales growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion leading to earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.84. We expect that our fourth quarter effective tax rate will be about 21% with a full year closer to 22%. We intend to undertake additional restructuring projects as we have the past two quarters enabled by this expected low fourth quarter effective tax rate. ","The difference between the organic and sales projections you see on this page is primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar. On M&A we have lapped the impacts of our two big divestitures, the aerospace government service business and the resins and chemicals business as well as the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition. Our fourth quarter and full year guidance does not contemplate significant cost to prepare our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses for the spins we announced last week. We're working to define those costs and work streams and will provide more details as we progress. ","Let's move to slide 8, last week we raised the low-end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to $7.05 to $7.10 per share up 9% to 10%. This growth excludes the impact of 2016 divestitures, fourth quarter 2016 debt refinancing charges, and the pension mark-to-mark adjustment. Based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30th we do not expect the 2017 pension mark-to-mark adjustment to be significant. We're raising our full year sales guidance to a new range of 40.2 billion to 40.4 billion up 3% to 4% organic and up 2% to 3% reported. This new range reflects stronger sales performance and outlooks in aerospace and performance materials and technologies. You can see the revised sales guidance on the right side of the page. We remain within the initial guidance for the segment margin and have narrowed our estimate to about 19% which is up 70 basis points year-over-year. There's no change to our full year free cash flow guidance. The year-to-date free cash flow performance has been good and each of our businesses continues to remain focused on improving our working capital execution. ","Let me turn to slide 10 for a quick wrap up, the third quarter marked another strong performance for Honeywell, each of our segments meeting or beating their commitments. We had outstanding sales performance and robust orders and backlog growth across the businesses that will help fuel continued growth. We expect to finish the year strong with fourth quarter organic sales growth between 4% and 6% and earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.84. For the year we raised our sales guidance to a new range of 40.2 billion to 40.4 billion and reaffirm the new earnings per share guidance range we provided last week, $7.05 to $7.10 per share. ","We continue to make investments to drive future profitable growth as well as to be begin to eliminate the residual costs we expect as a result of the announced spins of the Homes and Transportation Systems businesses. At Honeywell we're committed to driving share owner value, that means optimizing our portfolio as we announced last week but that also means remaining focused on delivering outstanding results on a growth, productivity, and cash flow every quarter of every year. With that Mark let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Tom. Darius and Tom are now available to answer your questions. So Christina if you could please open the lines for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone, and I'm sorry I signed on late so you may have covered some of this before. One of the follow-up points I had on the spin announcements, divestiture announcements earlier was the potential for and the use of the Honeywell brand for the divested businesses just it's kind of a clean-up question on that announcement, I will start there please?","Darius Adamczyk","Sure, I think as it relates to the Honeywell brand some of those decisions have not been made in terms of how we're going to -- what we're going to do with the brand for either the Homes or the Transportation Systems business. So I think that we will provide more clarity on that as we move forward but there are a lot of different options that we have and it's going to be part of our work product and we will be communicating that as it becomes clearer in Q1 and Q2 of next year.","Deane Dray","And how about just a broader question on a progress report and goals for the transformation of Honeywell to the software industrial Darius that you envision, just in terms of portfolio shaping the way you're looking at M&A emphasizing perhaps some software as a service opportunities within the portfolio?","Darius Adamczyk","You're right overall I'm very pleased in terms of how our Connected Enterprises is progressing this year. It is up double-digit which is very much in line of expectations. Margins are up even higher than that. In terms of acquisitions and landscape we continue to look at all segments of the business including our software plays. We've made one acquisition actually in the software area in Q3 which is pretty exciting cyber technology that although the business itself is relatively small we have very, very big growth opportunities for it and it's actually exceeding our expectations. So the software acquisitions in general will be more of the bolt on variety, those are the kind that we're looking at but overall we continue to make progress both on the P&L on Connected Enterprise continues to make progress on the build out of our Sentience platform and signing up more partners as we go. So we continue to be very excited about what we're doing. And the most important part of that it\u2019s generating the right kind of results.","Deane Dray","Got it and just last question, I know we're going to hear more of this in your outlook call but broad strokes, the outlook on 2018 in terms of the macro environment where do you think you're particularly well positioned both U.S., outside the U.S.?","Thomas Szlosek","Yes, Deane this is Tom. We are in the throes of our planning right now. We'll go through the details as we get into November-December. We're looking at trends continuing in most of our businesses. I mean you see the strength in aerospace, a lot of good flight hour activity, the defense is looking up. And you know with any luck at some point at the tail end of 2018 we will get some help from the Business Jet side. Although Business Jet usage remains strong, so we expect those trends to continue. ","PMT we really are encouraged not only by their performance but by the strength of the orders and backlog and it's been in all lines of business. I mean not to denigrate last year but we had great orders last year than they were in the aftermarket side. We're seeing a lot of front-end orders type business in PMT particularly in UOP and HPS which bodes well for building installed base and building our service business. So really strong trends there. ","In SPS Intelligrated continues to perform very well. We expect that backlog which is well over 20% to fuel excellent growth and we expect the trends in that vertical to continue with the e-commerce. And the safety business continues to do well. We've got the Android products on productivity and the software businesses and SPS so, good trends. You saw our fourth quarter expected growth and I think we'll see that continue into next year. So overall I see some trends, some growth trends continuing. Deane as you saw every quarter of this year the organic growth rate has improved and if our guidance holds up into the fourth quarter that should at least be equal to the third quarter and hopefully that continues into next year. So overall pretty strong conditions ahead we are encouraged.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning all.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","Darius could you maybe expand a little bit on your thoughts around PMT and UOP in terms of that refining cycle, given you a lot of -- I mean overall the tailwinds top line, I know you got equipment challenges but the cyclical versus structural side of this, now what are you kind of expecting given Tom's comment for the length of tailwinds in that -- one of that very important segment?","Darius Adamczyk","Well Steve as Tom pointed out one of the most important things for that business we always watch is the bookings. It is very much a long cycle bookings our you know backlog\u2019s up -- it's going to -- we know for a fact that is going to be up probably double-digit by the end of this year versus the end of last year. We continue to be bullish, we are winning a lot of work. We are particularly winning a lot of work in our high growth regions which I find to be really important because as you think about where PMT needs to be strong and has to be strong is in the development and progress of a lot of the developing regions and it's exactly where it is winning. So it's win rate in China, India markets such as this give me a great deal of comfort is that it's going to continue to perform. Our backlog position is strong and we expect another strong quarters of booking in Q4 and go into 2018 with a strong position. And the good news is we're kind of seeing it across all the segment whether it's our gas processing business, whether it is the catalyst business all of those have been particularly strong which by the way enjoyed the biggest order ever in Q3 in terms of our catalyst orders. So overall things are very much moving in the right direction for all of PMT but especially UOP.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, that's helpful. On SPS I think you had about a month of Intelligrated in that 3% organic, let me know if that's about right. So ex-Intelligrated which you say was up more than 20 so the rest of that business must have been down I don\u2019t know, low to mid single-digits or something. Can you give a little color on that and maybe it is on the mobility productivity side but just a better understanding of the organic performance ex-Intelligrated there? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, it's actually good and you see there's growth in every business. The only business where we didn't see growth was productivity products and the depth due to some of the challenges we previously communicated around the mobility platform because if we look at the scanning side of the business was actually up close to 20%. So we have one small area which is challenged and the productivity product business is challenged but as we just announced we have had exciting new product launch this week. We have more coming in the middle of November and another set of new product launches in the mobility segment coming in the middle of February. So we're not where we want to be on mobility and productivity products but I'm very confident that business as we have in the 2018 in Q1 and Q2 it is going to start turn their performance around as it launches these new offerings. But overall a very strong performance across the board by SPS other than the one issue you about and we aren\u2019t particularly surprised about the outcome. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, not to mention overcoming the storms and hurricanes in the safety business in particular. I mean as you know the oil and gas vertical is a big sector and there was a lot of push outs of projects and activity that that affected the -- particularly the gas monitoring business and safety. But overall the trends there are really strong as Darius said. ","Steven Winoker","Just numbers are -- it's up 1% though right, ex-Intelligrated Tom, so it was positive still?","Thomas Szlosek","Absolutely, yes. ","Steven Winoker","Yes, okay. ","Thomas Szlosek","No, no Steve I'm not saying that the numbers ex-Intelligrated were up 1%. I mean as Darius said, every one of the business wasn\u2019t just Intelligrated that was contributing more than 2% or 3%.","Steven Winoker","Alright, great, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hey guys, thanks for having me on the call this morning. It's nice to be able to get on calls and ask questions. Just first question, you guys you recently raised your dividend by how much?","Thomas Szlosek","12% Steve. ","Stephen Tusa","And the commitment has continued to do that and drive that faster than earnings going forward for the next few years?","Darius Adamczyk","Go ahead Tom.","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, the commitment that we've made, that Darius talked about at the Investor Day -- at our Investor Day was continuing for the five year plan with the idea of raising the dividend faster than the earnings growth. And we're coming up to the end of that. As we look forward we'll watch that but what the minimum we're committing to keep the dividend growth in line with earnings growth and it will track earnings per share. ","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, and Steve -- so as we said, as they've committed for the five year period which ends in 2018 we're going to grow dividends at a pace that is faster than earnings. We're committed to that, it is consistent with what we set five years ago. The period after that what I would say is going to be equal to or greater than earnings. We are going to provide greater clarity on that in our February Investor Day. But I'd expect to be equal to or greater than that. ","Stephen Tusa","Right and you guys have free cash flow so we can talk about that, at the -- have you seasonally kind of suggested that your cash should be kind of towards the higher end of the range, well just remind us what the target is 100%, is that for 2018 or 2019?","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, Steve the way I talked about that at the Investor Day and largely sticking to it is that by -- at run rate 2018 but really in 2019 we expect to be at 100%. ","Stephen Tusa","Okay and then just one last question, you know math is clearly not a strong suit, there are prerequisites for being on the sell side. But the math around safety and productivity solutions I was getting something a little different like maybe 1% or 1.5% growth in the core business and with your new Android products that is coming in would you expect that kind of core growth, I mean not that it really matters because Intelligrated is an organic grower that has tremendous orders, so I'm not sure why we are picking that apart in the first place. But would you expect that to get better next year with some of these new products coming into fray and changing productivity?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, absolutely. I mean we expect much improved growth rate in productivity products next year as these new product launch and gain traction. I probably expect it to accelerate a bit through the quarters because the bulk of our launches are coming in Q4 and Q1 so obviously it takes time to generate the orders but the short answer is yes. And that's -- I think we have continued to talk about productivity products, it is one segment of one business where we had a little bit of a struggle but across all the other businesses it has been a really nice story of both top line growth and margin expansion.","Stephen Tusa","Yeah, I guess people just can't live without adjusting numbers everywhere so I can understand why we would do that for a first segment like that. Congrats on a top tier organic growth and keeping your eye on the ball. ","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks Steve.","Operator","We will take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you guys. I was wondering if I could provide early perspective on any competitive implications of UTX Collins and have you given any more thought to the whole Boeing Avionics initiative and their stated goal of kind of moving into the aftermarket on the aerospace side, thank you?","Darius Adamczyk","Sure, yeah, so I mean I think starting with Collins and UTX obviously something that we have analyzed but the way we look at this is the capability that we currently have both on the mechanical systems as well as avionics are on par greater than anything that UTX or Collins would have in creating that merger. And I am particularly excited as it relates to our vision of connected aircraft because having both front-end and electronics as well as the mechanical systems really gives you strengthened capability to implement and deliver that vision of a connected aircraft. And it's not theoretical for us, it's something that we already have and are delivering and it's growing double-digit. And we're marching through the aircraft to get all of our systems connected. We already have APUs, launched wheels and brakes this quarter and we're going to be marching through so I'm not sure that that merger puts us in any kind of a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis UTX or Collins. And maybe most importantly I never viewed the aerospace segment as one where scale matters. What matters for our us is technology differentiation and that's going to be our basis for competition. ","In terms of the Boeing avionics and services announcement clearly we do respect what they're doing. There's not a lot of clarity yet and it was exactly what that means and what we are doing. Obviously Boeing is a highly valued and important customer for us which we're going to continue to work with and support. But we also have our own relationship with the end users, the airlines and we have a strong vision for growing our services and RMUs and connected aircraft as well. So, we are going to be as supportive as we can to Boeing and stay in sync with them and create a win-win for both companies.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks Darius, maybe just a follow-up on M&A, when you look at the pipeline and some of the portfolio actually you've announced, are there any larger properties that are attractive to you or should we expect more in the kind of couple of billion or Elster sized bites going forward or are there somethings\u2026?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, you know there is always things that are attractive but I would expect more of the bolt on variety that's really our sweet spot and that's where we are looking. And I would say our pipeline is built more bolt on variety type of acquisitions. But, you never know anything could happen but I would say I would be more expectant of bolt-on. ","Gautam Khanna","Thank a lot guys, good luck. ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, thank you. ","Operator","We will take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thank you, good morning everyone and I would also like to echo Steve Tusa's commentary, it is nice when companies allow question. So I want to start, was\u2026 ","Darius Adamczyk","We aim to please John. ","John Inch","Yes, you roll with the punches I appreciate it. So, with the pricing is there any discernible trend on pricing, there's a little bit of still this debate around [indiscernible] various companies are calling out and just curious. I realize you guys have -- you're not a huge rise spreads company but there is a little bit of impact, are spreads improving or how should we think about that? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, no, I mean obviously we're in a bit of an inflationary environment for some of the commodities but one thing I'm very proud of all our teams and all our businesses, they have really stayed on their toes, made the adjustments, understand what the impacts are and really are capturing the value that our services and products provide from our customers. So, I think overall we've probably been more challenged on the cost side this year than we've seen in a while. But I also think we reacted quickly, made the right adjustments, we have a very active value engineering program as well that produces substantial productivity. And we also understand the value that we bring to our customers and make adjustments as required. So all in all done a nice job here.","[Multiple Speakers]","Darius Adamczyk","Say that again John.","John Inch","Yeah, I just said, sorry, with respect to drag in the quarter this year versus last year if there's a way to kind of capture that?","Thomas Szlosek","No, I think we are -- when you look at the actual pricing it's what we talked about last quarter. It is holding in there quite nicely. We have been able to -- 50 to 100 basis point depending upon the business and largely recovering the types of inflation Darius talked about. Like he said the businesses are laser focused on -- particularly on the material inflation side. ","Darius Adamczyk","John, I would just point to the fact that every one of our businesses expanded margins in Q3, I mean every single one. So, and we're on that trend for the whole year as well.","John Inch","Yeah so, that kind of almost leads to the question of cash and given all the investments you guys have been putting in, the new products and so forth and the growth that you anticipate it's clearly what is picking up in PMT and aerospace. I forget Darius you had mentioned this in kind of the portfolio review call but what's your sort of line of sight to Honeywell getting to 100% free cash conversion if not higher than that and where does that kind of rank in your strategic priority list of things you're trying to accomplish?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, it's important and we're -- that's exactly what we're aiming is 100%, it is consistent with the message we have been giving. You know we're marching towards that goal where we did roughly 90% this year, we expect to see improvement next year, and then further improvement 2019. And it's a very conscious call and I can tell you that we've never had more focus on working capital than we do today. We are seeing some progress being made there and there's more to go but it's a very important goal, the goal that both Tom and myself and the rest of the business leaders take very seriously and we are committed to it.","John Inch","You know just lastly on the question to capital allocation, I mean you just basically said look, let's think about near-term, we will think about our foreseeable future bolt ons, while the stuff out there is pretty pricey given what's happened in public markets plus Darius I think a lot of the things that you want to aspire towards improving or realizing in your mix, software, industrial, etc I mean that stuff has got to be pretty pricey too. Is the playbook kind of in the intermediate term just we're not going to do a lot of M&A, I mean what's the -- kind of how do you judge that balance or gauge that balance, because you don\u2019t want to overpay but you don't want to sit and sort of do nothing if the prices are the prices, right? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I think that's fair and we've been very cautious. We've been very active by the way in the M&A area but we're going to -- the one thing we're known for we're known for doing days there and that is going to be the same there. And we are going to stay disciplined in terms of M&A. But if you're selective and you're active which we're going to be both of these things sometimes you can find the gems at the right price. So we're going to continue to try and going to have -- we have a robust pipeline and we're not marching off the field because things look expensive, they do but we believe that there are opportunities out there where we can participate in appealing valuation. Now having said that if there's nothing that happens we're obviously we're going to also be looking at buybacks as another way to distribute cash back to our shareholders. So there's always a balance, we'd like to have some ability to stay balanced. Our preference is for bolt on M&A but it's got to be smart and we got to pay the right price. And if we can't get that done then we are obviously going to be a little bit heavier on buybacks.","John Inch","Thank you and by the way you guys better hold on the Mark, good investor relations are hard to find.","Darius Adamczyk","I think the checks in the mail John.","John Inch","Any check would be welcome, trust me. ","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, it just feels like there's a lot of passive aggressiveness on the call today.","John Inch","Can't imagine why.","Operator ","And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, I will keep this one simple I think. Good morning guys. So SPS, so no passive aggressiveness, maybe some aggression but nothing passive. So, -- SPS organic growth obviously in 4Q we've kind of being shadowboxing around this as well, so math is not my strong point but Intelligrated would be about 2 to 2.5 points tailwinds to that number, so we're looking at maybe a core of 4% to 5% ex-Intelligrated?","Darius Adamczyk","I think, I will have to do the math, but each of the business is at least low to mid single-digit that you put in productivity product side. So for example the safety business Nigel, I mean where it was you know low single-digits in the third quarter that's going to be good mid single-digits in the fourth. And industrial safety will be well into the mid to higher single-digits, you know high risk businesses is doing well. We also will have really strong results expected on the retail business. As you know we've changed the business model, that's going to be well into the double-digits. Productivity even with the productivity products overall will be high single-digit in productivity. As Darius said, the scanning business is doing fantastic, work flow is going to be north of 20%, our software and sensing business will be mid to high single-digit. And Intelligrated will be up like we said it would be but it's everywhere and globally as well. I mean it's in the U.S., it's Europe, China, so it's not just a poll from Intelligrated that's doing this nor is it the productivity product pulling us down. These are all really good growers given an organic growth range we have talked about. ","Nigel Coe","It sounds pretty broad. One of your competitors dramatic drop to surprise warning in that warehouse business, I think it was yesterday or day before, seems to imply that leaves us some share, I mean maybe you could just touch on how you're seeing the maybe the front-end and the warehouse business as you go into 2018? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, we continue to be very bullish and we had a very strong orders quarter in Q3, we anticipate another one for Q4 and as I said, I think this is really well positioned because what's really growing the fastest is the e-commerce, high throughput type of warehouses. And that is exactly the sweet spot of that business and customers are seeing the value and we're generating the orders. And as you can imagine it's a very quickly growing playing field in warehouse automation given the expansion in warehouse and distribution. And we don't see that pausing, we are bullish on our Q4 and we are bullish on 2018.","Nigel Coe","Great, and then just a quick one\u2026 ","Thomas Szlosek","Go ahead, I was just going to say we did take note of the competitor announcement you talked about but our, as Darius said, our fourth quarter -- our third quarter was just fantastic in terms of orders growth and Intelligrated. I mean, strong, strong double-digits and as he said we expect that to continue. Backlog is really good, I mean compared to last year and it is all organic growth. I mean well over 50% backlog growth. So it's positioned very well.","Nigel Coe","And then just quickly Tom on the [indiscernible] margin expansion in 4Q, obviously the FX hedge we got in place for this year is margin dilutive given the dynamics of stronger revenues from weaker dollar but no impact to EBIT, so I am just wondering will that be about 20 bips or so that's what my math tells me?","Thomas Szlosek","You mean for Q4? ","Nigel Coe","For Q4, yeah. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, I mean the translation and -- that will be about flat for us I mean year-over-year. I don't think that's going to be a big impact overall FX for 4Q. When you consider the hedges, the movement in the rates and everything it's basically flat. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, got it. Thanks a lot guys. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning guys. Hey, just a quick one from me. You guys covered a lot of ground. I just want to get to hone in a little bit further on this free cash flow question looking forward and I'm just wondering perhaps it is for Tom but Darius you are certainly welcome to chime in, just what is the big bridge items next year when we think about free cash flow. I'm assuming CAPEX might be down a little bit, I don't know if you expect help on working capital, you've got growth that are mitigated against it, right so maybe your churns improve but maybe absolute working capital doesn't, pension etc, just what are the really the big items next year that kind of puts you on the path with 100% in 2019?","Thomas Szlosek","I mean when you look at 2017 Jeff I mean we're looking at about 1 billion of CAPEX although that could be a little heavy. When you look at that as a reinvestment ratio expect that to come down in 2020. There will be at least 150 million to 200 million less of CAPEX which is a big driver for us. We do have incremental cash tax spending this year and it's mostly timing related. We will have probably by the end of the year incremental 500 million year-over-year. I don't expect that to repeat next year so that should give us some tailwind. And then most importantly operationally Darius talked about is working capital. We're kind of improving our trends which means kind of treading water this year not necessarily adding huge amounts to working capital. The churn is kind of staying flat but as he said a lot of business is focused on driving that going forward. We're going to need 200 million to 300 million out of our working capital next year to go to drive towards that 100%. I would say those are the big three things that we're looking at.","Jeff Sprague","Great, I will leave it there. Thanks guys. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning guys. ","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Just a couple questions, on aerospace, as we think about the defense portfolio of programs, as defense budgets improve how should we think about your portfolio of programs relative to budget, i.e. do you think you can keep up with the budget, I mean is there something -- is there a big outline in terms of your programs that Honeywell is going to be very different? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think it's going to be aligned and I mean we're seeing really good growth particularly in the U.S. defense budgets where we I think we have obviously greater clarity and a much greater density. And that segment of the business is doing well. We anticipate to continue to do well and it will be aligned or higher than the growth. When it comes to international it's a little bit more hazy because obviously we are talking a lot of different countries, a lot of different programs, and we have some programs that are ending, some that are continuing but overall it's kind of an up Aero given what we're seeing in the geopolitical arena, anticipate slightly greater spending by NATO as a whole. And some recovery in the Eagle [ph] markets in the future which as you know is in that segment. So overall constructive comes to defense. ","Andrew Obin","Right, so that should be a nice tailwind to aerospace and another question just talking about China and emerging markets visibility. A) what are you guys seeing on the ground with this party congress, is everything on track? And the second, how should we think about your China exposure going forward given the portfolio changes that you guys have made now that your China business is really driven by Aero and UOP, do you sort of disconnect from the underlying China macro to a certain degree going forward, thank you? ","Darius Adamczyk","No, I mean China and India as we pointed out this quarter have been up 30% and that success is not isolated to PMT or Aero. That's for every one of our business segments and as you can imagine as Comac gets going even further Aero actually that revenue potentially is still way ahead of us not behind us. Secondly UOP, HPS are continuing to win across the board in China and India, tremendous successes there this year. Buildings and Home we approach those markets a little bit differently than we do in some of the developed markets but again double-digit growth in both. So very well aligned with the urbanization trends so whether it is the independent Homes business or the remaining buildings portfolio are going to do very, very well. ","Warehouse automation now moving on to SPS, again early days but it's a maturing segment and one which we're going to participate in. And then finally industrial safety another segment that's evolving when still in kind of their early days but clearly worker safety is very much on the forefront of the agenda of both China and India and the regulatory environment there is changing much more worker oriented. So across our portfolio we're excited about our potential in both China and India. Both of those are great markets, we have great management team, and have both a local perspective and the results speak for themselves. I mean 30% growth in Q3 I think is tremendous. ","Thomas Szlosek","And to add to that Andrew, just I think your inference was that we're dependent upon HPT for growth there, but if you look at third quarter I mean HPT was our slowest grower amongst all of the segments in China. So it really -- ","[Multiple Speaker] ","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thanks a lot guys. ","Operator","And we will take our last question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks guys, good morning. Tom, last quarter you stepped up restructuring and talked about 150 million of benefits, and those seemed like you would do a fair amount of restructuring here in the short-term. I know you talked about 150 million of benefits from that last restructuring but we have greater than normal restructuring tailwind as you enter 2018, I mean how do we look at that?","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, I mean I don't think it's necessarily greater than what we would have had going into this year. In fact if you remember Andy that we did the significant restructuring when we divided up ACS up into HPT and SPS, there was a fair amount of delayering that took place. It gave us some pretty good tailwinds as we headed into 2017. So in 2018 I agree we've put a lot of capital to work on restructuring and there is clear momentum coming. But I wouldn't say it's a multiple of the tailwind that we had coming in 2017. And we'll give you more color on that as we get into our earnings outlook in December.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That's helpful. And then Darius, Aero has been on pretty big positives, surprise I can tell you really the whole year so far. How much do you think the surprise has been the early year reorganization versus just you had a confluence of events last year that were kind of negative that have gotten better here in 2017 and maybe what's been the biggest surprise in the performance here in 2017? ","Darius Adamczyk","Well, yeah, I mean you're right. I mean Andrew I am very pleased with how it is performing. I think not that I'm surprised by it but I'm very pleased with what's happened in terms of commercial excellence, the business capturing the aftermarket business, the RMUs, the growth in connected aircraft. It's invested in that last year in Q4 about 200 sales people that's generating a lot of new sales and we watched that at a very detailed level. The business continues to drive productivities so it does what I always want every business to do which is grow the top line as well as get more productive every year. So, yeah that is certainly -- last year was a tough year, more headwinds on the concessions but the reorganization also helped as we segregated the decision making is now faster business, moves faster. So I am really pleased with how they're executing and its continued outlook for the future.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks Darius. ","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. ","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. I am pleased with our continued performance in the third quarter especially of our continued organic sales acceleration, our improved profit conversion, and our year-over-year improvement of free cash flow. We remain focused on delivering the sustained financial results you would have come to expect from Honeywell. There will be no distractions even as we work to spin the Homes and Transportation Systems businesses. I look forward to sharing more Honeywell successes with you and our plans for 2018 over the coming months. Enjoy the rest of your fall.

Ltd., Research Division","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Honeywell Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. We ask you to note that elements of this presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2012, share with you our outlook for the remainder of the year and provide a framework for how we're thinking about 2013. And finally, we'll leave time for your questions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we delivered another strong quarter, and it's driven by the strength of our balanced portfolio mix. We have a relentless focus on new products and geographic expansion and of course, our disciplined cost controls. In a more challenging economic environment, our margins expanded 110 basis points to 15.8% on 2% organic sales growth. We delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion, while continuing our investments, our seed planting for the future, despite a deceleration of growth across a number of our end markets.","Earnings per share of $1.20 included approximately $0.06 of tax favorability versus our normalized effective tax rate of 26.5%. Excluding the tax benefit, EPS would have been $1.14 near the top end of our previously communicated guidance range. When you compare the $1.20 to last year's $1.10, which had approximately the same tax rate, that's 9% operating growth. Or if both years were normalized at our 26.5% rate, it's an 8% operating growth. So no matter how you slice it, pretty impressive performance considering the terrific growth we had last year and the slow growth environment we're in today.","That increase in margins reflects our continued focus on driving productivity from our key process initiatives, the conservative planning assumptions around cost and our proactive restructuring. The businesses have done a great job controlling their indirect and discretionary spending, and we're also seeing further traction on our key process enablers, such as the Honeywell Operating System, Functional Transformation, Velocity Product Development and Organization Effectiveness or OEF. The upshot is that we're just starting to hit critical mass in some of our business -- biggest businesses and the benefits will continue to provide a tailwind for margin expansion even in a slow growth or no growth environment. And as I mentioned, we did this while also investing in the future, including funding additional R&D and CapEx. From a geographic perspective, we expect more of the same.","In Europe, we expect continued softness in our short cycle businesses namely ACS Products and Transportation Systems, at least through the first half of next year. However, we don't expect to see the magnitude of euro headwinds that we saw in 2012. And our balanced portfolio of short and long cycle businesses is helping to mitigate near-term trends.","Meanwhile, the Americas is holding up well overall, although we saw some deceleration in growth in the short cycle businesses of ACS and PMT as we expected. However, the indicators we're tracking remain positive overall.","The same is true in China as we are seeing lower demand for some of our products in our short cycle businesses, but overall growth, driven by double-digit increases in our long cycle businesses, namely Commercial Aero and UOP. We remain well positioned in China with our focus on East4East and an uptick in second and third tier cities where GDP is still growing faster than the overall country's growth. We feel good about the diversified nature and regional mix of the portfolio and we'll continue to benefit from our Great Positions in Good Industries globally.","With just over 2 months left in the year, we're very confident in our ability to meet our 2012 guidance. As a reminder, we've stuck by our earnings outlook all year and actually raised it slightly at the midpoint in prior quarters to reflect our stronger first half performance.","Today, we'll outline our thoughts on the fourth quarter, which Dave will  walk you through in more detail shortly, but at a high level, we're tightening our 2012 outlook by $0.05 each on the low and high ends, taking 2012 estimated earnings per share $4.45 to $4.50, meaning no change at the midpoint of the range.","And we continue to build on our Great Positions in Good Industries, making some smart bets in exciting growing spaces like natural gas processing. You saw our recent announcement to acquire a 70% stake in Thomas Russell for $525 million. Natural gas is a trend we're willing to bet on. UOP is already benefiting from the boom in gas production from U.S. shale gas deposits and increasing gas consumption abroad. Thomas Russell has great technology to recover natural gas liquids, and the opportunities to expand beyond the U.S. by way of UOP's global presence and capabilities is substantial. This is a unique transaction given the stage purchase and illustrates our continued disciplined approach to M&A. The overall M&A pipeline is robust, so you may see more, but nothing is a must-have, and we'll remain disciplined in our approach.","Turning to 2013, the clarity on the macro side is still murky. There's nothing out there to suggest anything but continued conservative planning is best. And we're expecting another year of strong margin expansion in a slow growth environment. We'll do that by executing on our key strategies for growth, sustaining our investments in new products and technologies, controlling our fixed costs through OEF and making sure we deliver the savings from in-process restructuring projects that we funded over the last couple of years. These projects are now estimated to deliver over $150 million of incremental savings next year. And there's more to come in 2014.","There are also a number of known tailwinds like Commercial Aerospace, Turbo and UOP. We have a very healthy backlog with positive order and win rates, which certainly helps increase our confidence. And our seed planting initiatives will enable growth even in a tough economic environment. We'll remain flexible and cautious as always in any event.","Honeywell demonstrated in the last downturn we're a company that executes well, even in a tough macro environment and we're doing it again this time. Segment margins are expanding more than we initially expected at the beginning of the year despite slower sales growth. So with sharp execution, benefits from seed planting and productivity initiatives, tailwinds from proactive restructuring and acquisition accretion will work to offset low global growth, contributing to the company's outperformance again in 2013.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David James Anderson","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start out on Slide #4 entitled Third Quarter Financial Summary and just take you through some of the highlights. Now, as Dave mentioned earlier, sales were up slightly year-over-year. We had 2% organic growth, Acquisitions contributed 1% growth, while currency yielded a 3% headwind in the quarter. And of course, that's been a challenge this year as FX -- and by the way, a point, kind of jumping ahead to 2013 is something Dave, too, that we would add. We don't anticipate the same headwind for foreign currency in 2013, which hopefully will help us in that environment.","Sales were lower than expected for the quarter, driven in large part by lower sales in Resins & Chemicals and also the ACS short cycle businesses, and we're going to talk more about each of those in just a moment. Overall, we saw a deceleration in growth rate in nearly every region in the quarter. However, we're continuing to benefit from the strength of our long cycle businesses, namely Commercial Aerospace, the ACS Solutions businesses and also UOP.","Now segment profit was up 8% in the quarter. Margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 15.8%, matching our quarterly record that we set in the second quarter. Margins expanded in 3 out of our 4 businesses, reflecting strong productivity and also just another demonstration that our playbook of disciplined cost controls is working in this environment.","Now as a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, we took an accrual for a change in the active medical benefit design. We took an accrual of $30 million. And by the way, this accrual was fully offset in the third quarter of 2011 by the CPG gain, which was a gain that we took in discontinued operation. Now importantly, that $30 million accrual does not repeat this year. When you look at the total corporate expense line for the quarter, corporate expense was $57 million, and that's really the run rate that we've had. If you look at second quarter, for example, of this year, $58 million, so the total corporate expense really doesn't play into the quarter at all.","Below the line was large, as expected, aggregate. In fact, the aggregate of other below-the-line items are basically on the run rate. We had a minor amount of repositioning. I'm going to talk about that in a little bit when we get to the year-to-date numbers as well. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.7%, roughly in line with the 23.2% from last year, but below the 26.5% that we've planned for. So if you apply our normal 26.5% tax rate to the quarter, it brings you to earnings per share of $1.14 versus our guidance of $1.10 to $1.15. Now as you know, tax rates are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter due to timing of a number of items. However, we're still planning to end the year with an ETR of 26.5%. So think about the tax favorability in the third quarter being fully offset with a higher tax rate just a little north of 30% is what we'd anticipate in the fourth quarter, so no net effect for the full year.","So again, earnings per share, up 9% to $1.20 and the quality of earnings remaining very high, with free cash flow over $1 billion, representing free cash flow conversion of 100% -- 107% of net income, excluding some planned pension contributions that we made.","Let's go to Slide 5 now, talk a little bit about the year-to-date financial summary because I think this is also a very important perspective in terms of viewing Honeywell's performance in 2012. You can see on Slide 5, sales up 4% on both a reported and organic basis for the 9 months with significant foreign exchange headwinds this year being offset by acquisitions. On an organic basis, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies, both up approximately 6% on the top line, including the favorable impact of lower load launch contributions in Aerospace, while ACS up approximately 3% for the 9 months and Transportation Systems roughly flat. Segment profit for the first 9 months, up 12%, roughly 3x the sales growth. Margins expanding 110 basis points to 15.6%. And as I mentioned, we did this while continuing to invest for growth. We funded additional restructuring in the quarter, which, on a gross year-to-date basis, brings restructuring to almost $100 million, adding to the existing pipeline of committed projects.","Additionally, RD&E spending is up over $80 million year-over-year across the company and we funded almost $600 million of CapEx, which is a $100 million increase on a year-over-year basis. So overall, earnings up 13% or up 15% if you exclude the operational results that we had from CPG last year.","So given that background, let's go to Slide 6, Aerospace. Sales for Aero in the quarter were up 4%. We continue to see good growth in the Commercial businesses of Aero, driven by strong OE demand, as well as aftermarket, we're going to give you some more detail to that, partially offset by modest declines in defense. And of course, that's consistent with what we've been expecting, what we've been guiding. Commercial OE sales in the quarter were up 14%, driven by increased deliveries for both large air transport as well as business jet. We saw the benefits of growth, Boeing and Airbus deliveries, resulting from the ongoing ramp-up in their production rates, and we also saw continued healthy demand in the mid to large cabin business aircraft segment where we continue to outperform.","Now the commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%, outpacing overall utilization rate despite tougher year-over-year comp. And a couple more insights on that. In the quarter, ATR aftermarket was up 3% slightly ahead of global flight hours. We saw ATR spares roughly flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. And again, consistent with our expectations, given the already high spares levels that we've been experiencing the last few quarters. Now it's important to point out that while flight hours for ATR have been slowing, the majority of that deceleration is really coming from a decline in regional aircraft hours, which we classify as aircraft of less than 70 seats, where Honeywell has an underweight exposure overall.","Now on the business aviation, we continue to see strong growth in the aftermarket, both spares and maintenance events year-over-year. Although roughly flat sequentially, as a result of high engine events and also continued strong uptake of Avionics upgrades or RMUs. Now as a reminder, we expect both the ATR and BGA aftermarket growth to moderate in the fourth quarter where ATR could see a slight decline given the challenging comps in the fourth quarter of 2011. But overall, we expect growth again in 2013 in line with flight hours. We're going to talk about that more in a few minutes. We're going to obviously continue to keep a post [ph] in the macro indicators here.","Now continuing with Aerospace. Defense and Space sales were down 1%, 2% organically in the quarter. We've seen program wind-downs, notably the TIGER program, which is, as expected, being partially offset by increased sales to our international customers where we've been benefiting from a number of new contract wins. Now again, just as a reminder, we anticipate Defense and Space sales to be down approximately 4% for the year, so a more significant decline anticipated in the fourth quarter.","Segment profit at Aero increased 9%, with margins expanding 90 basis points to 19.1%. Overall, a very strong quarter for Aero. It's hard to believe that we've had EMS for over a year, but we continue to be very excited by that acquisition and the prospects there. As we've highlighted, the comps are going to be tougher in the fourth quarter for Aero, but the significant number of new wins, both commercial and defense, the traction the business has had to maintain and improve their cost position globally will continue to give us runway for profitable growth in the business.","Turning now to Slide 7, ACS for the quarter. Sales were roughly $4 billion, up 2% on an organic basis. The top line for ACS was somewhat below expectations, with growth in the long cycle businesses, partially offset by slower growth in the short cycle businesses of ESS. Now ESS or the product pieces of ACS, their sales were basically flat on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, reflecting a softer September. Let's give you a little more color on that.","From a regional perspective, ACS saw slower year-over-year growth in the Americas overall, with pockets of weakness in both short cycle businesses in Europe as well as in China. The Energy, Safety and Security sales again were flat on an organic basis. Good growth in security and Scanning & Mobility, driven by new product introductions, but offset by lower sales in Sensing and Control and Safety Products. We also saw lower volumes in ECC due to the challenging commercial markets that ECC has experienced this year globally. We expect the tough marketplace to continue for the next few months, but we also anticipate benefiting in part from new product introductions, geographic expansion, as well as somewhat easier comp as we transition into 2013.","Now Process Solutions sales were up 5% organically in the third quarter. Orders declined slightly on an organic basis due to the timing for some large projects, leading to delayed order bookings. However, we've seen a nice uptick in the service bank of HPS and a higher mix of software content for projects, leading the margin expansion for the business in the quarter.","Now BSD, or Building Solutions & Distribution, the sales were up 5% organically, so consistent performance with the first half of this year. We continue to see a softening on the energy retrofit market for HPS, which is being offset -- I'm sorry, by -- for HBS, which is probably being offset by growth in their services businesses, along with growth in the security infrastructure projects and also increased volume in fire as well as in security and distribution.","Now segment profit for ACS increased 5%, segment margins expanded 60 basis points to 14.4%, so strong conversion in this operating environment. The growth in margin rate was driven in large part by the combination of commercial excellence, strong productivity, including benefits from lower direct materials, as well as some value engineering actions that the business took in -- throughout this year, restructuring benefits and also strong management of indirect expenses, this being then partially offset by continued investments that ACS continues to make for growth in both new products, as well as geographies.","Let's now go to Slide 8, give you a summary for Performance Materials and Technologies or PMT. Now for PMT, in the quarter, sales were up 1%, UOP was up 7%, Advanced Materials were down 3%. Segment profit was up 8%, segment margins expanded 130 basis points to 18.6%, offsetting the continued challenging global and market conditions. In UOP, sales were up 7%, in line with the expectations for the quarter. Book-to-bill was again above 1 in the quarter for UOP, and we continue to benefit from record backlog levels in that business. Licensing and equipment sales were strong, partially offset by the ramping down of the Petrobras FEED program, the Front-End Engineering and Design work, again as planned, as guided. And the business is executing well, continuing to win new projects, setting up nicely for another strong year in 2013. And of course, we couldn't be more pleased, as Dave said, about the addition of Thomas Russell to the UOP and PMT portfolio. And we expect to close on Thomas Russell in the fourth quarter.","In Advanced Materials, the Fluorine Products and Resins & Chemicals businesses continue to see weak global end-market conditions, which resulted in lower refrigerant sales, as well as lower R&C sales growth, which were below our prior guidance. And let me just give you an example for R&C, specifically, just some insight into that. In Asia, capital pricing was actually down 55% from the same period last year. And while that clearly impacts that decline in price, clearly impacts the top line for R&C and PMT, it's really mitigated at the operating income line by pass-through pricing and also higher volumes. So it partly explains both revenues below expectations and also margins being as strong as they are for PMT in the quarter. Overall, another strong quarter for PMT. It's a business that continues to execute at the very high levels and we're continuing to see smart investments there, which will capitalize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead.","Slide #9, Transportation Systems. In the quarter, sales were down, as we said, 10% reported, but only 2% on an organic basis. So despite a tough macro environment, the majority of the declines were driven by foreign exchange. Now transportation has mitigated much of the macro impact by executing flawlessly on a number of Turbo launches in the quarter, as well as a steady increase that we've experienced and benefited from in U.S. gas penetration, which has helped offset European production decline.","Now regarding the macro headwind for TS, the European light vehicle production was down 6% in the quarter, while Western European diesel penetration remained essentially flat. However, the relative strength of TS outside of Europe in a number of markets again helps reinforce the importance of our strategy to diversify geographically. Just to give you a little more color, we're growing clearly in the light vehicle gas segment and we expect penetration for that segment to double globally over the next 5 years. We see the fastest growth experienced -- being experienced over the next 5 years in North America and China, where we're also growing off a slower base what will be a meaningful piece of our businesses as we continue to expand the presence in these regions.","Now TS segment profit in the quarter was down only 14%, including 11% from foreign exchange despite the 10% sales decline. So productivity gains from HOS, repositioning benefits, both helped offset the impact of lower volumes. And the impact also of ongoing projects that we've been funding to drive operational improvements in the Friction Materials business. As you know, we've continued to invest during this downturn to improve the efficiency and flexibility of TS, which has improved our cost position for both Turbo and Friction and it's expected to drive further productivity benefits in the coming years. So with a background on the businesses for the quarter, let's go to Slide 10 and give you a summary preview for the fourth quarter.","So as we close out the year -- but we're expecting sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, roughly flat to up 1% compared to the same period last year. And by business, just a couple of highlights. In Aerospace, we expect fourth quarter sales to be roughly flat year-over-year, with continued growth in the Commercial side, in Commercial OE, which we expect to be, frankly, up double digit, and also commercial aftermarket growth, recoupling to utilization. This will be offset, as I said earlier, by Defense and Space. We're expecting program-specific declines, again, notably the TIGER program, which will lead to declines of approximately 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations that D&S will be down for the full year by about 4%.","In ACS, in the fourth quarter, we expect sales up 1% to 3%, with modest growth across each of the businesses. Now the ESS comps are expected to ease modestly, particularly in ECC, where, as you recall, we essentially had a non-winter the last season. And there's -- clearly, the possibility of a more traditional winter heating season this year. However, we're still expecting our short cycle end markets overall to be somewhat challenged, particularly in Europe. In our long cycle solutions businesses, we're expecting growth to slow modestly, as we've seen some slower conversion of backlog with project delays.","In Performance Materials, PMT, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales up 4% to 6%, including the favorable impact of the Thomas Russell acquisition. And consistent with our earlier expectations and what we've communicated to you, we expect UOP growth to be roughly flat organically in the fourth quarter versus, and just put it in perspective, the 19% organic growth that UOP has experienced year-to-date. We expect UOP to see continued growth, however, in 2013, driven by their strong backlog of projects and new wins and just the amount of activity that's taking place in that space. The Advanced Materials piece of PMT in the fourth quarter is expected to be up modestly on an organic basis, as new product introductions will help offset continued weak end markets overall.","And finally, we expect Transportation to have another challenging quarter, driven by the impact of lower EU light vehicle production, which we expect to be down about 9% in the quarter, partially offset by increased global Turbo penetration and also new launches. And of course, currency will continue to be a headwind as we're planning at a euro rate of approximately $1.25 versus the $1.35 actual of last year, impacting sales by roughly 5%.","So we think it's prudent to being conservative in our top line planning and as we expect to execute, however, on both cost and productivity actions. To put it in perspective, at the midpoint of our guidance, our sales will be approximately 3% higher than our last peak in 2008, but segment profit will be up over 20%. So with that in mind, you can see sales are expected to be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter. However, pro forma EPS, which excludes any mark-to-market adjustment of about 2% to 7%, and if you'd normalize the effect for the tax rate, and let me just state that again, pro forma EPS, we expect to be up 2% to 7%, but if you normalize the effective tax rate to our usual 26.5% versus again the planned, a little bit over 30%, we would now anticipate in the fourth quarter, EPS in the fourth quarter would be $1.13 to $1.18, up 6% to 10%. So you can see on -- slower sales growth, very good conversion, driving strong earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter.","Let's talk now -- this is on Slide #11. This is a slide that we've utilized with you previously. We utilized this in July and we've updated it now for you here in October. We think it gives you helpful insights in terms of how we're thinking about the second half of the year. What we've done here is we've updated each of these elements and shown you any changes in terms of how we're tracking and we've shown those changes in red. As you can see, some things are running slightly ahead of expectations like productivity and sales conversion. And others are running slightly behind like in Transportation Systems, with lower expected European macro, specifically lower European light vehicle production.","Now you can see commercial aftermarket, starting at the top of the page, in Aerospace, has held up well, particularly BGA, where growth is significantly outpacing utilization rates. However, not counting on further slowing of ATR flight hour growth, which we saw in the third quarter, driven by weak regional jet traffic. So for the fourth quarter, we're going to expect tougher ATR aftermarket comps, particularly due to the very strong rate of improvement in the fourth quarter of 2011 and moderating BGA aftermarket growth.","For ESS, ESS should see a benefit from a slight easing of year-over-year comps, resulting in low organic growth in the fourth quarter, driven by new products, again, and expansion in high growth regions. And in Advanced Materials and R&C, the pricing environment we expect to remain weak, with challenges supply and demand conditions. However, we expect this to be offset by higher volumes. But likely, this continues to be a headwind for us in the fourth quarter, particularly on the revenue side as we talked earlier, I gave you the example earlier.","Now the euro came right into the middle of our range and while we're currently above the $1.25, it's still, obviously, very fluid. So it's worth pointing out that we'll see almost, for the year, $700 million of top line foreign currency headwind of 2012. And while we can't be certain what 2013 will bring, at current rates, we would not have, obviously, that degree of headwind.","So taken together, we're staying balanced in our framing and importantly, the midpoint of our previous range remains intact, with a tightened full year 2012 EPS range of $4.45 to $4.50. So finally, just before going to Q&A, let's spend a couple of minutes giving you our preliminary thoughts on 2013. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty out there, but still some things are starting to take shape. As always, obviously, we'll provide guidance in mid-December -- specific guidance in mid-December.","So looking at Slide 12, on the left side of the chart, you'll see reflected the current full year outlook for sales and segment profit for 2012, assuming the midpoint of guidance for each of our businesses. Now what stands out, of course, is the terrific margin performance in each of the businesses in 2012. And to put that in perspective, we originally planned segment margin for Honeywell for '12 in the range of 15% to 15.3%. We're now looking at margins for the company to be in the range of 15.6% to 15.7% on over $700 million of lower sales. So as Dave mentioned, this performance really underscores our ability to outperform in both the good and the tough economic times.","Now again, while we're in the early stages of planning for 2013, we believe we are well positioned given what we're seeing in our major end markets, what we're hearing from customers, the strength that we're carrying in our end -- our long cycle backlog and of course, the continued traction on new products, as well as our geographic expansion.","Starting with Aero on the Commercial side, we expect aftermarket growth will be largely tied to flight hours, but OE should see continued strong performance, driven by higher OEM deliveries. We have terrific exposure on several platforms ramping up, which included the 787, the 747-800, the G280, the G650 and the backlogs at these OEMs look strong and stable. Aerospace has won over $20 billion in lifetime value of new, unannounced business. And while many of those remain several years out, we think it speaks to the quality of the long-term outlook for the Aerospace business.","For Defense, we expect another year of manageable decline, scenario planning around continuing resolution uncertainty and possible sequestration is ongoing. But consistent with our communications, we think the high probability outcome is to find the floor in Defense given the reset of the U.S. budget in 2013 and returning to modest growth in 2014. And as a reminder, we'll be doing a Defense Investor Day in November, where we'll discuss some of the possible outcomes from our scenario planning.","In ACS, we're planning for continued challenging end markets in 2013 despite the possibility for some macro easing, making our focus on new products and expansion in high-growth regions that's much more important for growth. Fortunately, we have good visibility in the Solutions businesses, driven by stable backlogs. Again, though, we're planning for slower growth with some project timing in the Solutions businesses, resulting in delays, which will impact the timing of backlog conversion and new order rate.","So in this environment, ACS is going to continue to focus on our productivity levers, the implementation of HOS, continued penetration on SAP\/ERP, as well as continuing to execute on previously funded restructuring actions as they continue to focus on profitable growth and good margin expansion.","Turning to PMT. UOP is poised for another strong year with record backlog and the addition, the exciting addition of Thomas Russell. Advanced Materials is planning for more of the same in their key end markets and similar to ACS, you going to see growth coming from new products and applications across that portfolio. PMT is making some attractive high return investments in new capacity to support growth and project wins. These investments, we believe, make a lot of sense and are expected to contribute to sales growth and continued margin expansion in PMT in the coming years.","For Transportation, for '13, we expect EU light vehicle production to be flat to down slightly. And for planning purposes, we've seen more pronounced headwinds in the production rate in the first half of 2013, while on the other hand, the business is very well positioned with new launches supporting the proliferation of Turbo penetration in both the U.S. and China. Those themes are going to continue. They're going to provide a healthy multiyear tailwind for Transportation, with penetration expecting to double over the next 5 years.","And as a reminder, Alex and his team have secured over $2.8 billion in new program wins year-to-date. So new launches are a very meaningful driver of growth for Transportation. So we're still in the process of rolling up our 2013 forecast. And again, our preliminary framework for 2013, we think, has remained appropriately balanced. We're quite positive on the operational side. As we've said in the past, we expect to grow earnings at a multiple of sales in what will likely be a slow growth environment. And this consistency of execution continues to put us on a very credible path to achieve our 2014 target. And again, as a reminder, we'll have the more detailed outlook with you on our Guidance Call on December 17.","So now let's just go to Slide 13 for a quick summary before turning it over to Elena for Q&A. So another quarter, obviously, left to go, but we feel very good about how we've performed year-to-date and we -- you know the numbers. There's no question it's been a challenging year. Certainly more so than we expected at the beginning, but Honeywell has delivered against our expectations, continuing to build on our track record of execution in both good and bad times. The playbook, as Dave has said, is clearly working. We've got good traction with HOS in each of our businesses. We're expecting 70% bronze or better in all of our sites by year end. We've increased R&D spending. We've amplified the effectiveness of R&D with VPD. And Functional Transformation is continuing to allow our businesses to improve service at lower cost, achieving 2 seemingly conflicting things at once.","Now we're planning for another year of top line slow growth in '13, as we said, but continued strong margin expansion. The results of our seed planting investments are going to provide upside in an overall weak end-market environment. And that said, with any macro easing and a stable foreign currency rate, and I cited the amount of headwind that we've experienced in 2012, nearly $700 million in revenues, equivalent to about $100 million of operating income impact to 2012. We could see earnings growth similar to what we're seeing this year. In any case, we're going to remain flexible, ready for either scenario, with disciplined cost controls, benefits from an improved cost position, allowing us to continue to invest in the future.","So we look forward to the dialogue with you on December 17. And with that, Elena, I'll took it over -- turn it over to you for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Dave. Stephanie, you can open the line and we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just maybe one detail question, then I'd like to back up for a higher level one. On the detailed side, just how are you thinking, what's your visibility into pension for the fourth quarter? And how you're thinking about that these days?","David James Anderson","Well, I think, on the pension side, we're looking at numbers right now, Steve, mid-80s in terms of a funded percent status. That means we're going to be in a pretty healthy mode going into 2013. So on the contribution side, we're just plan to play that by ear. There's no determined amount or required amount of funding in 2013, so we'll play that by ear. From a mark-to-market standpoint, we're going to have some mark-to-market expense undoubtedly at least in terms of where rates are right now. But the fact of the matter is and you've heard us say before, but the reality is we're going to have a rate tailwind at some point. So we're going to play that smartly, continue to look at that as something that we're going to manage very, very carefully, but frankly, we feel very good about the position that we're in overall regarding the funded status and the funding requirements for pension.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just backing up, Dave, you talked about starting to hit critical mass in the businesses and we're seeing continued cost control and margin expansion and I'm sure that pricing dynamics are based into -- baked into that, too. But as you sort of look at the quarter in the face of all these headwinds, can you talk a little bit about what you mean by critical mass here and how it affects the margin side of the business a little bit? And in light of the current environment and other dynamics, how you're thinking is evolving or continuing to evolve on the margin expansion side from a kind of peak-to-peak perspective?","David M. Cote","Yes, on the -- what I mean by critical mass is -- I mean, you've heard me use this phrase a lot, this goes slow to go fast, so when it came to HOS, we wanted to make sure we got it right and it was more important to get it right so that it was sustainable for a long period of time. So in the beginning, it was kind of slow, as you know, and it took us time to build that up, and in the beginning, actually cost us something, eventually got to neutral, then started to provide some benefit. Now we're starting to see the benefits really come through, because when you start getting to 70% of your manufacturing sites at bronze or better, you really start to see some big benefits from it as we've said before. When it comes to margin expansion, as you know, we've always said that, that was going to happen. We put out the 5-year plan and we felt pretty confident about being able to do that given all the seed planting that we've done, not just on the cost side, but on the growth side also to help mitigate some of the growth headwinds that we see. So between the kind of the growth plan that we've done and the seed planting that we've done on the cost side with the process initiatives, that's what's allowing us to be able to drive these kind of margin rates on slower sales growth and still be investing in the R&D and the CapEx that we need to keep growing. So we actually feel pretty good about that. And I'm sure you recognize that making the change to the growth plan the way we did to focus on margins was very timely given that we expected we were going to be seeing something like this economically and we wanted to provide that assurance externally that we did understand and we were willing to put our compensation on the line to deliver it. So we feel pretty good about it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just the pricing dynamics, a little bit more sort of near term, what you are seeing out there?","David M. Cote","From a pricing perspective, it's still okay. As you know, we're not a -- you're never going to see a 7% price increase from us, unless it's driven by raws like in R&C. But by and large, we still expect that it should be -- that it should work out just fine for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave Cote, in your opening remarks, you seemed a little bit more optimistic about the macro picture, the demand picture, than maybe some of your peers and some of the other calls we've had the last week or so. I mean, what are you seeing out there that gives you some confidence that China is, in fact, kind of making a turn and that the U.S. isn't getting worse here? When you cited short cycle businesses, can you be more specific, I guess?","David M. Cote","Well, I'd, I guess, divide that into 2 pieces. On the macro side, I don't believe there's a recession coming. But I do believe that there's a slow growth environment most likely to occur just because the world democracies are in gridlock over debt, whether it's Japan, India, the EU, the U.S., we're in gridlock. And I do believe there's the potential in the U.S. and maybe even in the world for a good economic recovery if government would actually do their job here and resolve the fiscal cliff and the debt. By the same token there's a potential disaster if they handle it poorly. All that being said, we're going to look at it as if it's just more of the same and you can't count on these guys doing what they need to. And we need to think about it in terms of, all right, what's the kind of conservative way to plan this? So we're going to plan conservative macros like we normally do. But overall, I still believe global GDP grows next year. When it comes to China, in particular, we grew again in China and we saw it both on the short cycle and the long cycle, more driven by long cycle. At the end of the day, I think we have to factor in this leadership transition that's going to occur. And as you know, there's 2 offices, one in October and the other transition is in the first quarter some time. And I see, in my view, China is making the right kinds of decisions and they recognize what they need to do to make the changes that are economically required. So I don't think it's smart to bet against them on this. And we've done a lot on kind of thinking about how to manage through that. So that's on the global macro side. On say kind of the Honeywell micro side, all the growth initiatives, the seed planting that we've been doing for years, because you don't just turn this on in 3 months, is what causes me to feel that even in a tough global macro environment, we can do pretty well. So we're not counting on booming sales growth next year, but we do believe that there will be growth for us even in that tough environment.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Good. That explains it. Can we move back to cash reinvestment? And I think most would agree the Thomas Russell deal looks pretty interesting. I mean, can -- you talked about having a pipeline, but no real rush to do anything or not. I think the words you used was nothing was needed per se, nice to have not needed to have or something. But I mean, if you had -- on this trajectory, you're going to be sitting on a fair amount of cash at the end of the year on your balance sheet. I mean, at what point do you say, \"Hey, the market is not giving us enough credit here for execution. We're going to start buying in our own stock or getting a little bit more aggressive with some of that cash\"?","David M. Cote","Well, hopefully, you'll be impressed with the consistency of my answer over the last few years. But we're still going to play that on kind of an opportunistic basis. I don't have a number in mind that says, \"Okay, this is way too much cash. We need to do something.\" I also think in uncertain times, it certainly doesn't hurt to have cash. I prefer to have it than not. We're going to continue to focus on how do we pay a good competitive dividend as you know and that's important. It's an important return to shareowners. And when it comes to acquisitions and repurchases, we're going to continue to look at both because to the extent we can do Thomas Russell type acquisitions, man, that is a real value adder for the company and I think you'd want us doing that. So I don't have a particular number in mind. Dave, I don't know if there's anything you can add.","David James Anderson","No, I think that's very well said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just picking up on that point a little bit, well understood what you said. But it does sound like the pipeline is active and although you don't have must-haves, it sounds like there's a lot of like-to-haves out there. I mean, how would you handicap the likelihood of you repeating a couple of these Thomas Russells over the next 6, 12, 18 months, however you want to frame it?","David M. Cote","Well, it's always tough to know, Jeff, because I said we always maintain a good pipeline and it's stuff that we want for the company, so it's not a case of \"Hey, look, that's for sale, let's go take a look.\" This is more stuff that we plan for. You just never know when all the conditions kind of strikes, so that you have a property that make sense and most especially at a price that makes sense. And that's always tough to predict. So I'd have a tough time handicapping that one and I would just say, we're going to keep our eyes open. If something makes sense, we'll do it. If it doesn't, we won't. It's just a tough thing to predict.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And I know you don't want to get too far out over your skis on the 2013 outlook, but I think Dave Anderson said 2013 EPS could look like -- the growth could look like 2012. I mean, what kind of revenue growth is predicated by that statement?","David James Anderson","I think we're looking at a low -- clearly, a low single-digits kind of number, Jeff, for 2013 given the...","David M. Cote","The sales growth.","David James Anderson","The sales growth -- sorry, organic sales growth, the way that we're looking at the exits for -- exit rates for each of our businesses for 2012. So that's the way we're thinking about next year. So it comes back, as Dave said, it really puts the onus on the playbook of operational discipline, continuing to emphasize value adding new products, which give us a lot of leverage in the marketplace and continuing to grow in the highest growth markets. So that's what we're going to do and...","David M. Cote","Just to add to that, I'd say in 10 years of doing this, we have never once been bitten by being conservative in our sales outlook. So we'd prefer to be on the conservative side of this. And we'll look at -- okay, global macro is not a big help. FX we don't expect to be a big hit. We've got the geographic, the new product expansion that Dave was referencing, and when we put all of that together, we say, \"Okay, the smart thing to do here as you plan your cost profile is to assume low single-digits sales growth,\" as Dave was saying.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just part of backing that up, obviously, is the restructuring and just other internal operational execution things you've been working on. It seemed like maybe there was an allusion to some additional restructuring, I don't know if that was the intent. But are there some other things that are potentially in the pipeline the next quarter or 2?","David James Anderson","I mean, it's always possible and part of our model is an ongoing active review of restructuring opportunities. We think that's very, very healthy and in best interests of continued margin expansion, earnings growth, value creation. What we've had on a year-to-date basis, Jeff, has been above what we would have expected on a gross basis, and we've been able to do it as a result of strong operating earnings and also as a result of better-than-expected performance on previously funded repositionings. So we've actually had a greater rate of attrition and other benefits that have allowed us to reduce the accruals on previous and take credits on credit for previously reserved restructurings, which have actually helped us fund new restructuring. So we've had -- as you know, we continue to increase our guidance for 2013 in terms of what the incremental repositioning benefit will be. And as I said today, we're now looking at $150 million of incremental operating income lift in 2013 versus '12 as a result of the repositioning pipeline. So that's very -- it's a very good point to bring up and very, very much part of the playbook.","David M. Cote","We're looking out for it, Jeff, to Dave's point, but we've got a pile of stuff already funded that we need to -- we're in process of getting done. So there's no need to do anything, but we're certainly always going to be looking for opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. I just want to pick on the point on repositioning. So Dave, I think you mentioned $150 million for 2013, the year-over-year benefits. Does that mean that 2012 has gone up similarly to if that was $150 million, where is that now standing for 2012?","David James Anderson","I think it's about $175 million, the number for 2012.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And with the bulk of that in the second half of the year, I would assume?","David James Anderson","There's a lot, yes, it increases over the course of the year, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So now we know why your margins are so good.","David James Anderson","Well, yes. It's certainly one of the contributors. It's another good point.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, absolutely. And then, if we just switch to 2014. You've been very helpful in 2013 already, but you're already starting to bump up towards the lower end of your 2014 margin targets, and I'm wondering and I know you're not going to change that, but can we now think about the midpoint of the margin range as now the most probable target for 2014?","David M. Cote","I would say, Nigel, I know my story and I'm going to stick to it. I'm going to -- the 5-year target is the 5-year target and it's my intent in 2014 to be able to show you, \"Look, we did what we said and here's our new 5-year plan,\" so that hopefully, you all look at it, and go \"Wow, it's been almost 15 years of these guys doing exactly what they say. Maybe we should give them the benefit of the doubt this time.\"","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's the story. So are you still planning to put out another 5-year plan, Dave?","David M. Cote","Yes, when the time comes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then within the plan, I think you've mentioned that you want to get friction back to breakeven by 2014. And I'm wondering, how does -- how is the deterioration in the European auto market impact that plan? And maybe you can just give us some color around that?","David M. Cote","Well, it certainly doesn't help, but at the same time, the transformation program we have is very much on track so we feel pretty good about that. And if there's any kind of sales help at all, it will just make it better. But certainly, we're planning to and think we can get to.","Operator","Our final question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So on PMT margins, we have a lot to choose from this year in terms of what a normal run rate is because you've got 22.6% in the second quarter, going down to 18.6% and then you're implying a significant sort of decline in the fourth quarter to the midpoint of the guidance. Can you give us kind of the sequential dynamics of what you see going on 2Q to 3Q and 3Q to 4Q and then maybe a little flavor on what you're thinking next year there?","David M. Cote","Well, just to give you, I guess, a sense for it, is it's a little bouncy between quarters in a year. But as you might imagine, Andreas is definitely planning and thinking about a margin rate increase next year and we all recognize the significance of that star performance. One of the things that is going to help that is that UOP win rate in backlog is just terrific. These guys just keep doing a great job. Ever since we started kind of more of that horizon 3 investing and the geographic reach, man, it's really paid off. So I would expect more goodness to come from that. Dave, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.","David James Anderson","Yes, just the one thing I think I would add in terms of just a detailed item and it's something that we've talked about previously, it's just, Shannon, it's just the anticipation from UOP of less para-xylene, particularly catalysts, also some licensing in the fourth quarter. And that's just associated, we've used this term lumpy in the past as we've talked about UOP. It's something that we've anticipated. Therefore, their margins will be a little bit lower than the run rate they've experienced on a year-to-date basis. I've talked about that significant organic growth, that 19% year-to-date revenue organic growth in UOP through the first 9 months. So basically a flat top line and from, if you will, a makeup of their business, some of the less of the more profitable elements of their business in the fourth quarter, so -- but that's going to correct itself. As Dave said, that's all going to -- as we look forward to 2013, we're looking for a very strong start to the year out of PMT and out of UOP.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And you're also, I guess, going to have some -- these Thomas Russell deal costs will also hit in 4Q. Is that part of the 4Q pressure?","David James Anderson","Yes, there's a little bit of that in terms of margin diminution that will occur because we'll get some revenues without a lot of earnings or no earnings from Thomas Russell in the fourth quarter. But we're actually looking for Thomas Russell to be accretive in 2013.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Right, okay. And then just -- can you talk maybe a little more color on this slowdown in backlog conversion and the push outs? I mean, are these things that are being tabled for quite a while or just pushed out of quarter and where are you seeing them?","David James Anderson","Well, specifically, what we referenced is in the Process Solutions business, as well as in the Building Solutions and for different reasons. It's really, on the Building Solutions, it's really energy and energy retrofit. Some of that has to do with just the regulatory requirements to enable some of the funding on the energy retrofits. That's become more cumbersome, more complex, more time-consuming, so we're seeing some delays. The demand is still there. We feel very, very good about our overall positioning, but it's going to create a slower growth profile for that business in 2013. And on the Process Solutions side, what we're seeing is just some delays in terms of project funding, which is impacting their order rate, which in turn, will cause some near-term slowing in terms of the outlook that we have for them on the revenue side. But again, fundamentals remain very good, very positive. The pipeline of activity is excellent. So it's just that we want to make sure that we're tempering, if you will, some of the top line outlook for both of those businesses as we transition from '12 to '13.","Elena Doom","I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave for any final comments.","David M. Cote","Yes, thanks, Elena. As you can probably figure out by now, we're quite pleased with our performance in the quarter and I certainly hope all of you are also. And it's our intent to continue outperforming in the future. The reason for all of that is the seed planting that we talk a lot about and that we're going to continue to do. We were able to get this kind of margin performance even while continuing to invest the way that we need to, whether it's geographically or new products. And that seed planting, it's just going to keep on going, whether it's how do we grow or how do we make ourselves more efficient and it continues to pay off over time. We're going to plan on a slow growth environment because we just think that's the prudent thing to do. If we get any kind of macro help at all because, we'll say, the world's democracies actually start dealing intelligently with their debt, this could be even better and we're hopeful that, that will happen, but we're sure as hell not going to count on it. So we're excited about the future of Honeywell and where we're going and what we think we can do and I certainly hope you are also. Thanks for listening.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of this presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10(k) and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 and share with you our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2015. Finally as always we will leave time for your questions at the end.","So with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks Mark, good morning everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter capping off terrific 2014. In this fourth quarter we delivered better than expected operational performance in each of our key metrics at sales, margin, earnings, and cash meeting or exceeding our guidance across the board. We have delivered 4% organic sales growth following 5% growth in the third quarter and we continue to drive margin expansion up 130 basis points excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 aerospace OEM incentives which we discussed in detail last month. We delivered earnings per share of $1.43 up 15% year-over-year or up 11% normalized for tax. ","So another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range with strong execution across portfolio. For the full year we increased sales on an organic basis 3% while continuing our seed planting with investments in new products and technology, high ROI CAPEX, and expansion of our global footprint. ","We achieved significant margin expansion with benefits from our key process and productivity initiatives and we have been able to achieve all this in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. The momentum we saw in the second half gives us confidence in this year. Our short cycle businesses continued to improve with good organic growth in the commercial aftermarket business, ESS, advanced materials, and transportation systems all suggesting a modest improvement in end market conditions overall. ","We are also seeing good momentum out of our long cycle businesses building on our robust backlog. We believe the portfolio is well positioned to deliver this year and beyond enhanced by the smart gain deployment actions we have taken over the past years. While I believe the global economy could be a bit better this year than economists are forecasting currently, we will as always plan conservatively in our outlook and remain flexible. ","As you will hear in a moment, we continue to plan for a slow to no growth environment in Europe. We\u2019ve hedged over 80% of our P&L exposure related to the Euro and we remain focused on controlling our spend. As Tom previewed in December, we sold the final 1.9 million shares of B\/E Aerospace stock this quarter. To remind you, we originally received 6 million shares as time to consideration for the sale of our Aero consumable solutions business in 2008. ","At that time those shares were worth about 150 million. We sold those shares over the course of the last five quarters for total of about 500 million. We deployed the results and gains for restructuring and other actions to proactively position the company\u2019s future growth and profitability. The actions in the fourth quarter will significantly benefit Aerospace over our five year plan and we believe we are well positioned for future success with our commercial OE customers as a result. ","Now there continue to be a lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio to drive those results and to highlight a few Honeywell standing and mobility delivered another quarter of double digit organic sales growth benefitting from new customer wins. Following the success we\u2019ve had with Intermec HSM announced in December the acquisition of Datamax-O'Neil, a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers used in a variety of retail, warehousing distribution, and healthcare applications. This acquisition positioned HSM to expand in the $1.5 billion global bio-code printing segment and build on their existing printing capabilities prior to that. ","The team is really excited about this acquisition which extends our global reach and provides scale and significant synergy opportunities. Transaction is expected to close this quarter. While our dealer activity in this past year was modest; the M&A pipeline remains robust and we intend to maintain our disciplined process and extend our strong track record. We\u2019ve also talked a lot about our Solstice line of refrigerants, insulation materials, aerosols, and solvents that have ozone depletion of zero and a global warming potential lower than co2. And that\u2019s a thousand times better than what it replaces. ","Earlier this month we announced that our flowing products business has started full scale commercial production in our Baton Rouge, Louisiana facility of the newest Solstice product. HFO-1234Ze, now that is one impressive catchy name so I think we are going to publish stick with Solstice. We are seeing increasing demand for our entire Solstice suite of low GWTP material. The lifetime value of signed agreements in 2014 exceeds 2.3 billion and we have an additional billion dollars plus under negotiations. ","Process solutions has also been a bright spot as we close out the year. Organic sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year and orders were up double digit in the fourth quarter supporting continued growth this year. HPS is transforming project execution with LEAP, that is lean execution of automation projects and is innovating to win the market with automation offerings across control and safety systems, field devices, plant optimization software and services. ","We are also excited about the growth synergies from HPS and UOP doing together. Our ability to match UOP process and operating knowledge with HPS control and advance software solutions will enable unmatched operating excellence while refining petrochemical and gas process in customers. You can expect to see more of our innovation on display at the margin investor day where each of the businesses will highlight a number of heavy influence, new products and road maps for our future growth in productivity. ","We also plan to share with you how HOS goal is evolving throughout the organization which we believe is a key differentiator. We held at our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month and I could tell you that each of the businesses are hard at work finding new and innovative breakthrough objectives to drive growth and margin expansion. Having successfully performed against the five year targets we set for 2010 to 2014 we are now focused on delivering 2015 and the five year targets we issued last March for 2014 to 2018. 2014 was a strong start. Our business model works. Having a strong portfolio with great positions in good industries, making sure the machinery works better every day for our customers, suppliers, and employees and a culture that focuses on one Honeywell and evolving our capability and technologies. From our culture we get sustainability results. So with that I will turn it over to Tom. ","Tom Szlosek","Thanks Dave and good morning. Let's begin on slide 4 which recaps our fourth quarter results compared with the guidance we gave you last month at the December Outlook call. On the left hand side we have outlined the guidance we shared with you in December. On the right you can see our results for the quarter as reported. I am not going to walk through each line item here but you can see based on the check marks that we delivered or exceeded our guidance on each line item including the top and bottom line. The incremental sales and segment profit enable us to beat the higher end of our EPS guidance range and also perform incremental restructuring and other actions in the quarter. ","There are couple of transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter that are worth reminding you and again they unfolded exactly as we forecasted in December. First we completed the sale of the remaining BEAV share as Dave said resulting in a $114 million gain, $0.14 per share on an after tax basis. The timing of the sale was important from a tax perspective as we noted in December. The timing allowed us to offset that gain with other items and therefore incur very little income tax on the transaction. ","Also in the quarter our aerospace business recognized the cost of certain commercial OEM incentive that became due when our customer achieved contractual development milestones on platforms which will include Honeywell avionics and mechanical content. The cost was 184 million or 114 million on an after tax basis, that is $0.14 per share. As you know we have won significant content in the air transport and business aviation sectors and such upfront incentives are part of the business model. And as you are also aware, accounting for these incentives is quite conservative. ","Many others in the industry defer these types of cost on their balance sheet and expense them over the life of the platform. We believe charging incentives upfront gives greater transparency to our OEM profitability in this segment. Also the OEM incentives position us well on the platforms already won but also to win new business on the content to be selected in the future. ","I am now on slide 5, which shows the fourth quarter results without the aero OEM incentives or BEAV gain. Sales of 10.5 billion increased 1% or 4% on an organic basis. The absence of friction materials and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar were headwinds to reported sales growth in the quarter. If you recall we divested protection materials in the third quarter so that there will continue be unfavorable sales headwinds throughout the first half of 2015. ","We are encouraged with the growth momentum that are beginning to emerge. We achieved 4% organic sales growth in the second half of 2014 compared with 2% for the first half and 2% for all of 2013. The growth we saw in the fourth quarter was broad based and resulting in better than expected performance across the portfolio. I will provide more color as we review the business groups in a moment. ","You can see that segment profit increased 9% with segment margin expanding 130 basis points. Our efforts to drive commercial excellence supported by differentiated technology continued to produce results. In addition productivity remains a key driver of margin expansion offsetting inflation and our continued investments for growth. EPS was $1.43 up 15% consistent with our historical practice, this excludes the annual mark to market adjustment for defined benefit pension plan. ","In the fourth quarter this mark to market adjustment was approximately 249 million or $0.23 per share. Principally driven by lower discount rates in our German and Dutch plans. So the fourth quarter reported EPS was $1.20 and for reference purposes the mark to market adjustment in 2013 was 51 million or about $0.05 a share. ","Finally free cash flow in the quarter of 1.3 billion representing conversion of 119% and an increase of 6% from 2013. So overall we generated very strong results in a relatively slow growth environment and we increased our annual dividend in the fourth quarter by 15% to $2.07 a share, continuing our commitment to growing the dividend faster than the earnings rate growth and a trend you can expect will continue. ","On slide 6, same fourth quarter results we are presenting on a reported basis. So as you can see our reported sales decreased 1% and that was driven by the aero OEM incentives. No change to the 4% organic sales growth in the quarter as shown in the previous page. So on a reported basis segment profit decreased 2% with margins contracting 20 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. Again the only difference from the previous slide -- is the inclusion of the 184 million charge for the aero OEM incentives. ","Moving to net income, the BEAV gain and the OEM incentives fully offset one another on a net of tax basis and normalized for tax EPS in the quarter increased 11% year-over-year. The rest of the figures on this slide are identical to the prior fourth quarter slides. I am now on slide 7, a recap of full year of 2014 results again without the impact of Aero OEM incentives over the BEAV gain.","Full year sales of 40.5 billion, up 4% or 3% on an organic basis. The primary difference between the reported and organic rate is the Intermec acquisition net of the impact of the protection materials divestitures. We saw a good organic growth across the portfolio including in scanning mobility, the fire industrial safety businesses, transportation systems, and UOP. Segment profit increased 8% demonstrating strong sales conversion and resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in the segment margin rate to 17%. ","All this resulted in earnings per share excluding pension mark to market adjustment of $5.56 a share up 12% over 2013. Representing our fifth consecutive year or double digit earnings growth and EPS $0.01 above the high end of our December guidance range. Our reported EPS of $5.33 for the year again reflects the $0.23 mark to market adjustment that I mentioned for the fourth quarter. ","So finally free cash flow was 3.9 billion in line with our guidance. Free cash flow increased 16% year-over-year despite an approximate 16% increase in CAPEX investments in the growth areas we previously shared with you mostly in the PMT. ","So let\u2019s move to slide 8 to show the full year 2014 results including impacts of the aero OEM incentives and BEAV gains. To quickly recap 2014 sales were up 3% on both reported and organic basis to 40.3 billion. Segment profit was up 5% resulting in a 30 basis point margin expansion to 16.6%. So the aero OEM incentives reduced the reported growth from 4% to 3% and reduce its margin expansion from 70 to 30 basis points. The rest of the page again remains the same as the previous slide and now I want to move on to slide 9 and discuss the businesses starting with the aerospace.","This first slide highlights the fourth quarter reported and organic sales growth rate for aerospace. As a reminder in the fourth quarter 2013 aerospace recognized an IP mitigation settlement resulting in a onetime royalty gain of 63 million in defense and space that was offset at the time by OEM incentive in BGA. Both of these items were included in and therefore netted out in sales and segment profit at the aerospace level in 2013. ","Total reported aerospace sales were down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven by three items, the 184 million OEM incentives that we discussed in our outlook call back in December; two, the friction materials divestiture which closed in the third quarter; and three, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on reported results. Whether on an organic basis fourth quarter sales now were up 4% driven by strong execution across the portfolio and each of the three legacy aero businesses accelerated growth in the fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters. And transportation systems continued its mid single digits growth performance. ","Organic sales growth in aero has accelerated throughout 2014 like Honeywell. So if you recall aero was up 1% in both the first and second quarters, 3% in the third quarter and now 4% to close out the year in the fourth quarter. If I look at the individual pieces of aerospace starting with commercial OE, sales decreased 14% on a reported basis driven by the net unfavorable impact of the OEM incentive. However on an organic basis sales grew 7% and that was principally the result of robust engine shipments and business in general aviation for the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer Legacy 500.","Moving to commercial after market, you can see 4% sales growth on both the reported and organic basis. ATR spares growth was balanced across both mechanical and electrical product lines offsetting moderation in BGARMUs, that\u2019s retrofit modifications and upgrade. Both airline and business jet repair and overhaul activity improved in the quarter as well. Defense and space sales declined 3% on a reported basis driven by the absence of the prior year licensing royalty gain I just mentioned. However on an organic basis sales were up 2% in the quarter. ","International programs continued to drive growth with double digit sales increases offsetting modest declines in our U.S. DOD and government service businesses in the fourth quarter. Finally transportation system sales declined 16% on a reported basis reflecting the third quarter friction materials divestiture and foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic basis TS sales increased 4% in the quarter as we once again saw strong volume growth in light vehicle gas applications where we continue to see increased global penetration. ","We are also continuing to see our European commercial vehicle volumes grow as we benefit from new programs following the implementation of Euro 6 submission, regulations in the region. As you can see the underlying business growth trends across the aero portfolio remain positive consistent with the outlook we have provided to you in December. ","So I am now on slide 10 continuing with aerospace. The fourth quarter sales results and commentary are consistent with what I just discussed. So for the full year aerospace sales declined 1% on a reported basis driven by the friction materials divestiture and the impact of the OEM incentives. On an organic basis sales increased 2%. Aerospace margins contracted by 160 basis points in the quarter driven by the OEM incentives but excluding the 184 million charge for the OEM incentives. Segment margins in the fourth quarter were actually up 210 basis points driven by productivity net of inflation where material productivity continued to be a significant driver. Also commercial excellence and a favorable impact of the friction materials divestiture. And for the full year you can see that aero segment margins expanded 140 basis points again excluding the OEM incentives. ","So let's turn to ACS results on slide 11. ACS sales were up 6% on an organic basis in the quarter excluding an approximate 3% headwind from APEX. The growth came in above our guidance with both ESS and BSD finishing the year strong. ESS sales for the products businesses were up 7% on an organic basis in the quarter continuing the trend of progressively stronger growth noted in each quarter of 2014. ","Scanning & Mobility continues to perform well driven by new product introductions and large program wins such as the U.S. coastal service program we had in the last quarter. In addition we continue to realize integration benefits from Intermec supporting the strong growth we have seen from the combination of the two businesses. The pending acquisition as Dave mentioned of Datamax-O'Neil compliments our existing portfolio in the attractive bar code printing space acquired with Intermec. As for the rest of ESS, growth was driven by new product introductions, further penetration in high growth regions, higher residential sales which benefited both ECC and securities. And improvements in the non-resi market which benefited our supplier and industrial safety businesses. ","Building solutions and distribution sales were up 4% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter with continued strength in the Americas Fire and Security distribution businesses and acceleration in building solutions. Particularly within building solutions we saw a good growth in the Americas as well as an increase in higher margin service business. Both the building solutions backlog and service banks were up mid to high single digit on an organic basis supporting our outlook and confidence for sales acceleration in 2015. ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. ","The business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volumes and productivity net of inflation supported by our HOS initiatives offset by continued investments for growth. In addition we continue to realize incremental synergy benefits from combination of Intermec with HSM. So overall very good growth and execution of ACS and a lot more to come as the team continues to coordinate the individual businesses more and more through connected ACS which is an initiative to drive an enhanced degree of integration across the businesses and in particular in the supply chain and product developments and in the marketing areas. Alex will take more about this at our Investor Day in March. ","So moving to slide 12 for performance materials and technologies, PMT sales in the quarter were up 2.6 billion up 3% on an organic basis were approximately flat on a reported basis driven by foreign exchange headwinds. We will address the impact of lower oil prices on the PMT businesses in a moment but there was very little impact on PMT results in the quarter. For the fourth quarter UOP sales decreased 1% on an organic basis and as a reminder UOP had exceptional organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 you will recall. They were up 17% last year driven primarily by increased catalyst sales, so a very difficult comparison year-on-year. ","UOP executed very well reflecting strong licensing revenue which partially offset the lower catalyst sale. We also continued to see strong order trends in gas processing particularly at UOP Russell giving us confidence as we head into 2015 and we anticipate further sales growth in 2016 and 2017 for the new capacity additions across UOP and also through advanced materials which come online in 2015.","In process solutions, organic sales growth continues to accelerate. HPS was up 6% in the quarter while on a reported basis sales were flat at the organic or the strong organic international growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds. HPS saw strong volume growth driven by the advanced solution software business and the HPS service business in all regions. Orders, backlog, and service bank growth also continued at a strong pace up double digits on an organic basis in the quarter and this orders growth increased steadily throughout 2014 which sets process solutions out nicely for accelerated sales growth in 2015 and beyond. ","Advanced material sales increased 4% on an organic basis driven by double digit sales and orders growth in flowing products and demand for a new low global warming potential suite of Solstice products continue to grow. This was partially offset by a decline in resins and chemical sales in the low single digit range. Driven principally by the market base pricing model whereby selling prices are closely tied the market price of raw materials. Most notably benzene, which is highly correlated to the price of oil. ","Well sales can be volatile. The pricing model largely protects the profit dollars in resin and chemical even on lower sales. PMT segment margins were up 90 basis points to 16.5% which exceeded our guidance driven by higher volumes and productivity net of inflation probably offset by a continued investments for growth. In UOP the higher mix of licensing revenue in the quarter resulted in a tailwind to margin. HPS also converted particularly well continuing with successful business transformation and benefiting from the growth I mentioned in the higher margin advance solution software and service businesses. ","I am now on slide 13 labelled 2015 planning update. And similar to what we did in December related to the impact of oil price declines on the portfolio I wanted to address some of the major global trends affecting our portfolio and explain how each of these items are impacting our plans for 2015. Let me start with oil price declines. Overall we continue to view the impact from lower oil prices as being net neutral to UOP and HPS. ","The upstream exploration and production parts of the value chain continue to represent at relatively small portion of our portfolio roughly 10% to 15% of the combine UOP and HPS businesses. And our upstream backlog has held firm. We are beginning to see some delays further downstream in countries that have net oil producers such as Russia and the Middle East. As refining and petrochemical progress decisions are deferred. On the other hand in countries that are big importers of oil, most notably China, India and the South East Asia region. As we had anticipated, the lower oil price has stimulated more discretionary mid and downstream spending where we are well positioned. This is being borne out for example in process solutions where orders and backlog grew roughly double digits on an organic basis in the quarter, as I highlighted earlier. So again we think oil prices are neutral, the UOP and HPS businesses at this time however we continue to monitor this activity closely as we look ahead. ","Sales in residents and chemicals will be negatively impacted by lower prices for the -- lower oil prices for the reasons I mentioned earlier. But while sales can be volatile, the pricing model again largely protects our profit dollars in this business even on the lower sales. Finally we anticipate will begin to see the favorable effects of lower oil prices on our cost structure particularly in our indirect spend and we believe this will accelerate throughout 2015. Of course it remained to be seen how oil prices will impact the global economy should prices stay below $50 longer term. However we continue this will be a net positive for the economy and Honeywell over the planning horizons. ","Turning to currency fluctuations we\u2019ve obviously seen a continued weakening of the Euro. As we highlighted in December our 2015 plan is based on the Euro exchange rate of $1.20 as the midpoint. We have hedges in place covering approximately 80% of our Euro P&L exposure so whether we continue to be pressure on the sales line, our Euro based earnings are protected. We also continue to see volatility across our other currency exposure which again are likely to result in headwinds of the top line however similar to hedging we done for the Euro the actions we\u2019ve taken largely protect our 2015 earnings outlook for these other currencies as well. And we will continue to actively monitor the situation. ","The outlook for the U.S. economy continue to improve and we are expecting a positive uptick in our U.S. businesses as a result. But we also remain focused on increasing our presence in high growth regions. As a reminder HGR now represents almost a quarter of our total business and are expected to drive 50% of the sales growth over the course of our five year plan. The population growth urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across our entire portfolio. ","In China we anticipate high single digit growth in 2015, after a year of roughly mid single digit growth in 2014. Our initiative of becoming the Chinese competitor continued to accelerate and bear fruit. Investments and local sales and marketing resources are targeted to the higher growth cities in China where local economies are growing much faster than the overall China GP. ","Also our one Honeywell approach specifically in ACS continues to drive cross selling opportunities across multiple channels. In addition we are building a robust pipeline of new products here towards the macro trends in the region, namely air purification, energy efficiency, and security. All these factors give us confidence in accelerated growth for Honeywell in China in 2015. ","In India after the investments across the region slowed in the first half of the year while the elections unfolded the second half of 2014 was very strong for Honeywell and we anticipate growth will be roughly high single digits in 2015 driven by international defensive space business, new launches in transportation systems, new product introductions in ESS across each of our major verticals, and growth in BSD from infrastructure projects and services. ","In Russia where our exposure is limited we have less than about 500 million in annual sales there. We continue to have a strong backlog in our long cycle businesses. We expect Russia to continue focusing their available capital on energy, so oil and gas and renewal of their aerospace sector, two areas where our portfolio is well positioned to grow. Our short cycle businesses in Russia have been impacted particularly as it relates to currency devaluation but again the exposure there is relatively small. And while our management team is paying close attention to the issues faced in the country, we are also continuing to look for opportunities to enhance our business in the region. ","In the Middle East we expect continued double-digit sales growth in 2015 after approximately 20% growth in 2014 and this is driven by big wins in both the short and long cycle businesses as infrastructure investments continue. Our portfolio was well positioned to benefit from even outpays in some cases to attractive growth rates in these markets. ","Turning to the non-residential sector, we are encouraged by the expected acceleration of commercial construction spending. Forecast to be up approximately 4.5% in 2015 and the continued solid growth on the industrial side in 2015. So as a reminder roughly 75% of the ACS portfolio serves the commercial industrial market and our balance portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on improvements in these areas. More specifically on the commercial product side after modest growth through the first three quarters of 2014 we saw some acceleration of fourth quarter with strong growth in the U.S. We expect the U.S. to continue to drive further commercial products growth in 2015 as well as acceleration in our high growth regions with strength in our ECC and Fire Systems businesses in particular. ","In the industrial products markets we expect higher sales of industrial safety equipment particularly in Americas which represents about half of our exposure. As for building solutions, the backlog from our projects businesses and service bank through mid and high single digit respectively on an organic basis this quarter and we continue to expect energy efficiency project to support global acceleration in 2015.","With regard to our pension plans the net effects of higher investment returns and lower discount rates will drive up a 125 million increase to pension income for 2015. Now we intend to fully offset that increase with restructuring over the course of the year. In total our international pension plans represent approximately 25% of our worldwide defined benefit pension obligations. In the U.S. we ended the year with a discounted rate of 4.08% and a return on assets of 8% which resulted in U.S. funded status of approximately 95%. Globally the funded status is about 94%. We do not anticipate any 2015 cash contributions related to our U.S. plants. ","Let me turn to slide 14 to summarize our outlook for 2015. Our full year guidance is identical with what we shared with you in December. We continue to expect sales in the range of 40.5 billion to 41.1 billion up 1% to 2% on a reported basis and up approximately 4% on an organic basis. Reported sales growth is expected to be lower in organic primarily due to the impact of friction material divestiture and the foreign exchange headwinds. We are planning segment margin expansion of 100 basis points to 130 basis points or up, 60 to 90 basis points excluding the fourth quarter OEM incentives. ","We are projecting EPS and this excludes the pension market adjustment of $5.95 to $6.15 representing 7% to 11% growth versus 2014. The quarterly growth trends remained in line with our prior year results and this range also continues to be based on a full year income tax rate assumption of 26.5% and share account held roughly flat to 2014 level. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of 4.2 billion to 4.3 billion up 8% to 10% from 2014 with CAPEX investments peaking at roughly two times this depreciation in a more normalized rate of CAPEX investment so around 1.25 times depreciation we expect free cash flow conversion to be at roughly 100%.","So I am now on slide 15 with the preview of the first quarter. For total Honeywell we\u2019re expecting sales of 9.4 billion to 9.6 billion that\u2019s down 1% to 2% reported but up 3% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up approximately 110 basis points and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.41 up 6% to 10% versus 2014. ","Starting with aerospace sales are expected to be up 3% to 4% on an organic basis was down 2% to 4% on a reported basis reflecting the year-over-year absence of friction materials as well as foreign exchange headwinds. We are expecting positive organic sales growth from each of the four businesses in the quarter. ","In commercial OE we are expecting sales up lower to mid single digit driven primarily by new platform wins and BGA. The growth is driven by favorable demand trends for high value business jet platforms where we have significant new engine content. In commercial after market we are expecting sales to be up low single digit with continued repair and overhaul growth as well as ATR spares growth in the quarter driven by higher demand for both mechanical and electrical products. Partially offset by a decline in BGA RMUs against the challenging prior year comparisons. ","Defensive space sales are expected to be up lower to mid single digit in the quarter driven by continued strength in international businesses. In transportation system sales are expected to be up mid single digit on an organic basis were down significantly on a reported basis driven by the absence of friction and the foreign exchange headwinds I mentioned. On organic basis the growth in TS is primarily driven by new launches and strong light vehicle gas demand at each of our three key regions, U.S., Europe, and China. As for aerospace margins we expect an increase 100 to 120 basis points driven by commercial excellence, significant productivity improvements across the portfolio along with the favorable impact on the margin rate from the friction material divestiture. ","Turn to ACS sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% organically or flat to up 2% on a reported basis with continued mid single digit organic growth in both ESS and BSG. The difference between reported organic rates reflects the foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. The end markets where we primarily participate, residential, commercial, and industrial are all looking moderately better as we start 2015 and we continue to benefit from new product introductions and high growth region penetration. ","Also the strong orders growth we saw at the end of 2014 involve the short and long cycle businesses, gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for 2015. ACS margins are expected to be up 100 to 120 basis points with continued benefits from commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation while accelerating investments for growth and new product area such as connected homes and in high growth region. ","Further we expect to realize synergies from integration of Datamax-O'Neil acquisition after the transaction closes as we did with Intermec throughout 2014. In PMT sales are expected to be approximately flat on an organic basis and down approximately 1% to 3% reported driven by foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of lower oil prices on resins and chemicals, a point I made earlier. ","Excluding these factors PMT sales are expected to be approximately 4% in the quarter. We are expecting UOP to be up low single digit with gas processing sales expected to drive majority of the growth. In HPS we\u2019re expecting organic sales up mid single digit. A favorable orders and backlog growth we saw in 14 will support the sales acceleration in 2015. ","On the advance material side we are expecting a low to mid single digit organic sales decline principally driven by a double digit decline in resins and chemicals due to the fact as I mentioned earlier. These declines are offset by a continued strength in our flooring products business which is benefitting from increased demand relating to the new products principally the Solstice product suite. ","Also PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 100 to 120 basis points versus 2014, driven by higher volumes and productivity as well as a favorable margin rate impact of the market based pricing model in resins and chemicals. ","Let me move to slide 16, for a quick wrap up. In 2014 we demonstrated once again that Honeywell can deliver on its commitment in a relatively slow growth economy and amidst of very volatile global trends reminding once again the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio the management team focused on execution and the strength of the Honeywell playbook and P&A. ","Combined these enabled us to add to our performance track record as we exceeded guidance on sales, achieved significant growth in segment margins and delivered on double-digit EPS growth we originally laid out last December. We are going to continue investing in our future with a focus on profitable sales growth. This will continue to meet investments in high ROI CAPEX and new product development and in sales and marketing resources particularly in high growth regions. The investments are paying off and you can see it in our results. ","As we turn our attention to 2015 we recognize the uncertainty in the macro environment but this is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We are confident that our portfolio is well positioned for continued outperformance. ","Our order trends both short and long cycle point to accelerated sales growth for next year that should enable continued strong improvement in our profitability. We are forecasting strong organic growth in 2015 and over 100 basis point improvement in our margins as our HOS golden issues are deployed across the portfolio. In addition we have significant restructuring savings in the bank for 2015. ","So we will continue to execute in 2015 and beyond. We are very excited about the upcoming year and have a lot of momentum across the portfolio as we head into year two of our five year plan. We look forward to telling you more on our March 4th Investor Day. So with that Mark let us go to the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Tom. Lisa if you would please open the line for questions. ","Operator ","Thank you sir, the floor is now open for question. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. ","Steven Winoker","Hey, good morning all. ","David M. Cote","Hey Steve. ","Steven Winoker","After last quarter's multitude of congratulations, I am hesitant to say it again Dave, but I will say nice quarter and I guess I will get blamed by all my colleagues out there for doing this. ","David M. Cote","Yeah but same thing is nice. You wouldn\u2019t want to do something like that.","Steven Winoker","Well, I am trying to be very cautious on that front. It is one of my development needs. So any way listen, on the outlook call we spent a lot of time, you guys provided a great amount detail for thinking through the oil price -- declining oil price impact across all your businesses and I am trying to compare that to what Tom just walked us through but the thing that really is of maybe concern to me is that midstream downstream commentary where in December you really talked about how it was a net positive in terms of refined product demand investment downstream and other areas. I would just like to get a little more color on that particularly around the impact of maybe narrowing oil and gas spreads on some of those investments that are happening out there, just some more color on why we shouldn\u2019t be worried about this for you guys and why is it actually a good thing?","David M. Cote","I will kind of start with my perspective on it and turn it over to Tom for even more color commentary. But there is a difference between the upstream and the mid and downstream segments as you know and the mid and downstream in my view are going to be driven more by overall economic activity. Demand for that could be driven more by overall economic activity than whatever oil prices are. As a result of that I am expecting to see increased demand for refined goods and products which is going to cause greater demand on the mid and downstream side. ","Offsetting that at least in the short term is probably going to be some of the investments in places like Russia and Middle East, perhaps some in Brazil but they had already slowed significantly. That we will be more than offset by where everybody has to crank up everywhere else around the world. So that's kind of an overview that I see for it and as you probably know for the first time in five years I am actually a little more bullish on where the global economy is going than economic forecasts are. ","For the last four years I had been more negative generally and so far that's been a good call. But this time I think it could be more positive than what they think because that impacts. The lower oil prices is causing this major redistribution from oil producing to oil using economies and those oil using economies are quite large. So overall I think this is a good phenomenon, it is going to help drive more of that mid and downstream investments. Tom. ","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, again what I would reiterate is the portion of our HPS and UOP business that's in the mid and downstream number one. Number two, the backlogs really backed up by the strong second half particularly in HPS are really strong. If you look at HPS, the backlog on a constant currency basis up 12% year-over-year and UOP backlog is also the UOP backlog is relatively flat 0% to 1%. But when I look at UOP continue to be always a lumpy business. Fourth quarter was a difficult comparison as I said, we had 17% growth from the fourth quarter 2013. But the backlog is strong as it\u2019s ever been, its holding up, and our growth rate in 2015 are forecasted for UOP is at mid single digit growth or constantly look at all the indicators. ","Steven Winoker","And UOP is lumpy but with a very positive trend. ","Tom Szlosek r","And Tom you are not seeing any backlog price renegotiations. There is a lot of chatter about that in the market. No not at all we probe and probe this you might imagine and the only development I would say is you know deferral on new orders where you know multibillion dollar investments where decisions are being thought through carefully in the regions that Dave mentioned. But by and large that\u2019s about the only impact we\u2019ve seen so far.","Steven Winoker","Okay I\u2019ll hand it off, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. ","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys. ","David M. Cote","Hey Scott.","Scott Davis","I am glad to see you guys are bullish. We haven\u2019t had a lot of positive conversations in the last couple of months. But maybe you can, I think your view on oil was pretty clear Dave but give us a sense of a view on currency and really the angle I am looking for is we\u2019ve had a such a violent move that how does it change to competitive landscape. Do you see guys who can come in from Japan or other high cost regions like in Europe that can now suddenly compete against you and areas where they couldn\u2019t compete against you before is that real or not real. ","David M. Cote","Well as you know the Japan phenomenon on this been a currency phenomenon. It\u2019s been a couple years in the making and I can\u2019t say that we ever saw much of an impact from any of that. I guess it remains to be seen on what happens with European competitors but again not thinking much of anything happening there when it comes to the overall currency we\u2019ve assumed the U.S. dollar would strengthen for a while now and we\u2019re little surprised actually that didn\u2019t happen sooner than it has. So I would say it is one of those things we\u2019ve been kind of counting on happening and as you know this is the first time in, well this is my going into my 14th year, this is the first time we\u2019ve ever hedged the Euro translation and its solely because it seems like that was the 70% debt at this point. Who knows, things have a way of changing in ways that you never predict. But I still think that the prospect of 110 Euro this year is entirely possible. ","Tom Szlosek","The other thing I would add Dave is the hard cost base. We do benefit in some cases from the decline Scott, you are are fully aware we have significant production capacity in China and Mexico and other parts of the Eastern Europe. So we do feel like our position from a supply chain perspective and cost base perspective does enable us to continue to compete with the \u2013 of the competitors you referred to. ","David M. Cote","I hope you got the good point Tom just made Scott.","Scott Davis","Okay. ","David M. Cote","We have great presence in Europe already. We have a big base there about 30,000 employees so we have a base to compete from. ","Scott Davis","Okay fair enough and then guys give us a -- I was encouraged by what you said about non resin, our forecast is actually a little bit higher than your forecast so I hope we are right and you are not right but either way directionally it is the right answer. But can you walk around the world a bit on that and what\u2019s really tough for us to get a feel for as we\u2019ve got great data in the U.S. on non resin and things that we use to contract and once we get outside of the U.S. it starts to get a little bit more difficult. So can you walk us around the world and more in context on maybe your order book or backlog or how you see it playing out in different regions? ","Tom Szlosek","Sure, it will be pretty consistent with how we\u2019re seeing the economy. The U.S. would say I hope you are right also. We\u2019re little lower in our estimation but we think that continues to rise upward and it\u2019s still kind of a reflection of the great recession and you heard us say the time about we shape in, we shape out, slow in, slow out, and non res construction is more of a slow in, slow out. So we think it\u2019s a nice steady gain and that just continues. ","You can argue there is some offset to that with the oil and gas CAPEX but that has really minimal effect on our non res construction business. In Europe it is consistent with the economy, it is going to be very slow. China probably going to continue to be a mix and interesting phenomenon there because the tier one cities that are still experiencing more of the economic slowdown, they still could use more housing and in the some of the tier 2, 3, 4 cities where GDP is going to be growing faster may have been over built a little bit. ","So that one is still to be figured out but overall we think it is still a net positive on non res construction. India there could be an awakening in India. I have never seen such excitement in the business community in the 20 plus years that I have been going there so I am actually pretty encouraged about what they could be doing and in fact I am going there tomorrow to be there for the President\u2019s visit as part of this U.S. India CEO forum. And I really think there could be a kickoff there that we\u2019ve all really been waiting for, for at least 10 or 12 years now. And one could turn out to be quite a good positive. ","David M. Cote","The thing I would add to that Dave is, Scott to get your questions on the non resi, I look at our exposure in the products businesses in ACS principally in fire and in some of their commercial business in ECC. As I said in my comments the growth rate had been very nice, mid single digits approaching and double digits in some cases. So you know good trends there and then in building solutions where we have the -- we provide both projects and services in that same space. The order rates and backlog has been good. If you look at the backlog overall for the business it\u2019s up about mid single digit over last year. And its across all the regions. It is actually double digit in Europe but that comes off a lower comparison but overall each of the regions are in that range. So we feel like its heading in the right direction. ","Scott Davis","It\u2019s encouraging. Well have a safe trip to India Dave and give the President my best. ","David M. Cote","Okay. ","Scott Davis","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning gents. ","David M. Cote","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, just a couple things back to the energy exposures and the like. On UOP in particular and kind of the capacity that you put in place, do you guys have people contractually locked up there, is there any kind of take or pay or if this thing does kind of unexpectedly to kind of a sharper turn to the worse you are kind of exposed there?","David M. Cote","Exposure is not that great it helps that we get up front payments on the technology licensing. So yes, if there was a severe downturn of course we feel it but I am not that worried about it right now. ","Jeff Sprague","I mean we are seeing a few refinery cancellations in the U.S. just two this week alone. I was also just wondering on hedges, Tom how those work, was there a P&L expense in 2014 to prep yourself here for 2015 or is that running through on the balance sheet somehow? ","David M. Cote","No, good question Jeff. All of the hedges qualify for mark to market accounting. I am sorry qualify for not mark to market, I am sorry about that. So the impact of the hedge instruments when they settle would be recognized at the same time the underlying items that are being hedged are recognized. So there is nothing unusual, it\u2019s just the extent of the currencies that we\u2019ve gone out and hedged. ","Jeff Sprague","Okay and I was just wondering if you could give a little more specific color on aero spares. When you spoke to kind of aftermarket generally and kind of all in with R&O but what\u2019s going on in spares trends, are you seeing more activities over aeroplanes that might be fuel cost related or anything that kind of stands out?","David M. Cote","I\u2019d say on the -- it\u2019s a little bit of a dichotomy between ATR and BGA but real strong growth on the ATR side than mid single digit growth on the spares. Its growing on BGA side as well but not as significantly but we do expect that to improve and the ATR trends to continue for 2015.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, great. Thank you guys. ","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning. ","David M. Cote","Hey Steve.","Steve Tusa","Mediocre quarter but you now it\u2019s good enough for you Dave. Just on UOP, just remind us how much of that business is new projects and if you were to see an air pocket in new projects what kind of backlog do you have today to kind of give you a little bit of leeway to take action. So for example in the first quarter if you saw that number go down 30%, when would that hit you revenue wise, I mean is that even a 2016 issue or is that more like a 2017 issue? Or is it a 2015 issue?","Tom Szlosek","I guess I would consider the composition that UOP backlog Steve to kind of answer that question. As I said the backlog has held up very well. ","David M. Cote","But you have a tough time even in the recession I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more that often. ","Tom Szlosek","I think on the capital side a lot of these where we come in on these capital projects is towards the middle or the end and so the most of the capital spent in the ground and we can make it solid and the systems and the technology. So the backlog is holding up. I would also say that if you look at the composition of the backlog it\u2019s in the catalyst, it\u2019s in equipment, and it\u2019s in gas and in all three places its holding up and there is really not any material difference from what we are seeing. So like Dave said I haven\u2019t heard or seen anything in terms of potential declines there.","Steve Tusa","Right but I guess I am just trying to understand what kind of visibility and timing dynamics play in to your ability to take action if you do see something like that?","David M. Cote","Well we have time to react not just there but around the company. ","Steve Tusa","Right and your orders and backlog in UOP, and the orders in the fourth quarter and then what your backlog in the year at. ","David M. Cote","I don\u2019t know that we disclose that backlog.","Steve Tusa","Wasn\u2019t it like 2.8 billion or something like that at the end of the third quarter. I know you guys gave a number your HPS day at November I believe?","David M. Cote","Not at the top of my head but we can get back to you on that one. ","Steve Tusa","Okay and I guess just one other question on the capital allocation. And any kind of change in philosophy around buybacks versus deals here, anything getting a little more attractive and is the market kind of bumps around?","David M. Cote","I wouldn\u2019t say our philosophy has changed and that\u2019s why you saw that\u2019s increased dividend greater than the earnings rate this year because that\u2019s consistent with our five year plan of raising the payout ratio over this five year period. So that is going to continue to be a priority for us. And I\u2019d say on the M&A pipeline I am actually feeling better about that then I have in these past few months. I always felt good about it but I\u2019d say the work Roger is doing and its businesses are doing is improving that overall pipeline. Doesn\u2019t mean anything is going to be happening soon. But I can say I feel better about it. I think there is some increasingly let\u2019s say good properties, it would be very good fit with Honeywell if we can make them have them.","Steve Tusa","Got you, great. Thanks a lot. ","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks good morning. ","David M. Cote","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hey Dave, so you mentioned you\u2019re feeling more bullish in the consensus for first time in the five years and everyone is against CFO, hot spot is coming somewhat, it sounds like you might be about to deploy the balance sheet, is that a fair comment, you mentioned the backlog is looking pretty \u2013 but just conceptually is that correct?","David M. Cote","Just like trying to study you\u2019re saying am I getting ready to do something?","Nigel Coe","Well just give me assets and multiple that comes down a little bit and you got more bullish view on the economy then most competitors?","David M. Cote","Yes well I would never of course say anything one way or the other there Nigel. I\u2019d just say I am encouraged by the work the guys are doing on the pipeline and the stuff I am seeing. And we\u2019ve got the capability and we are just going to continue to be smart about it. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And you all see the commissary around done solutions is really encouraging and its because he will be general construction activity. But I am wondering the end, the performance contracting, and the saving part of that circle for you. are you seeing similar trends there and there is bit of debate that\u2019s low energy prices may some of this look pickup pushed out do you agree with that whole process? ","David M. Cote","I guess you would have to say yes, possible but we are not seeing that because it\u2019s not like $50 oil is cheap. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that we were concerned that it could be a recession if it hit 35? So 50:50 is not cheap, it\u2019s cheaper than it was but not cheap. ","Nigel Coe","Okay and you\u2019re similar trends in the before the contracting side of things?","David M. Cote","Yes orders are good there. ","Nigel Coe","Okay and just a quick one on the hedge accounting term. So the way that works is you take the full impact on the top line and then the mitigation institute the line?","David M. Cote","Well actually the items that we are hedging and we can get into a complicated accounting lesson here but the items that we are hedging are actually cost items and we are doing it selectively throughout the portfolio. As you can appreciate we have a global supply chain and a lot of currency movement across borders. What we do is focus on hedging the expense items and that enables you to protect the overall P&L but what that leaves open is the top line and so the top line is in a lot of cases exposed to currency movement.","Nigel Coe","Right and then just quickly, I think you mentioned you hedged down to 110 is that correct Tom?","Tom Szlosek","No, I said our plan was based on 120, and we\u2019ve hedged at a rate that I think protects that pretty well.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. Thanks guys. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you, good morning everyone. ","David M. Cote","Hey Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Dave I guess since last time I saw you guys say congratulations to your past just like notwithstanding. But the\u2026? ","David M. Cote","Not reading the post and the news just ahead of the ball so to speak with this. ","Joe Ritchie","Indeed they are and they probably should but moving on to maybe a question on capital allocation I just want to ask Nigel\u2019s question slightly differently valuations have come down especially in oil and gas, has your priority in terms of where you are looking for the next target does that change at all just given clearly they\u2019re more attractive valuations on the oil and gas side today?","David M. Cote","Well I would say I would backup on it I guess and say that great positions in good industries are still going be kind of a fundamental for us. And secondly pricing makes the difference. So there is a lot of stuff that we\u2019ve liked in a lot of different segments many of which we\u2019ve outlined for you in the past. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at does pricing makes sense, does it makes sense today versus further into the future. And we tend to try to be pretty careful about timing when it goes into even picking of a great position in a good industry. ","Joe Ritchie","Okay that makes sense and I guess given this month you just got back from your top 300 meeting I\u2019d be curious to hear how do you feel about the progress that you guys are making in terms of pivoting the company really to an organic growth story. The margin story is there but really pivoting to organic growth and improving your cash flow conversion over the next few years?","David M. Cote","Maybe the best way to say it is that coming out of that meeting we had 300 unbelievably energized people even more so than I\u2019ve seen in the past and everybody is really pretty bullish not just about what we\u2019ve done but about where things are going. And HOS Gold and what we are doing to develop and fund the breakthrough initiatives, the 76 enterprises is really energizing everybody around the world, it\u2019s just wonderful to see. ","Joe Ritchie","Okay, alright. So pretty confident in the outlook there and I guess maybe one last follow up question on TS. Tom you mentioned that the growth has been really good. Your exposure is predominantly to Europe and you\u2019ve got auto builds that are expected to moderate in 2015. You mentioned in your prepared comments that there has been increasing improvement in the light vehicle gas application. Is your portfolio positioned well for that opportunity and maybe just a little bit of color there?","Tom Szlosek","Well first of all the and what I am referring to is that the increase penetration turbos on the gas combustion engines on light vehicles that that\u2019s just a trend that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S., China, India everywhere and we are well positioned to take advantage of that. We have got not just manufacturing capacity in each of those places but also your local product development capacity and engineering teams that work with the OEMs in those region. So it feels like we\u2019re pretty well positioned and the growth rates support that.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks guys. I\u2019d get back in queue. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Co.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you, good morning. Hey, a lot of detail already just drilling into ACS a little bit. It\u2019s nice to see a 6% organic number against the 5% organic comp a year ago in particular, just wondering how you guys are kind of processing attribution here in terms of markets first, execution against VPD and HUE and things like that?","David M. Cote","Pretty well overall. I think some of the businesses are doing extremely well with it and so the scanning and mobility for example, we have to highlight the gas detection business is done extremely well with it and then I\u2019d say everybody else is kind of in the middle of progress but progress is good everywhere. It is really working well.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks that was all. ","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Macaluso for any additional or closing remark. ","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Lisa. With that I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Dave for final remarks.","David M. Cote","Well we\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve done but even more importantly we are excited about where we are going. Our business model really does work and while I believe that lower oil prices will lead to a slightly better global economy than what\u2019s forecasted currently, will plan conservatively as always to ensure that we do deliver on our commitments to you. We believe we are well positioned to deliver on our five year commitment to you and we look forward to seeing many of you at our March Investor Day where we\u2019ll share more about how and why we\u2019ll get there. And in the mean time the following Sunday in a very American Sport I hope we can all be Patriots. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"11131":["Honeywell International, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elena Doom","Good morning. Thank you, Leo. Welcome to Honeywell\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast including our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning, we will review our financial results for the second quarter, then review our outlook for the second half and the rest of the year and then leave time of course for your questions.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen by now, Honeywell had another terrific quarter and a very good first half 2014. EPS of $1.38 increased 12% year-over-year when normalizing for tax, so another quarter of double-digit EPS growth, with earnings coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. We saw strong execution across the portfolio with margin expansion in each of our four businesses.","We\u2019re continuing to benefit from our enablers and keep process initiatives that are delivering growth and productivity benefits and we\u2019re achieving this while continuing to invest for the future, planting the seeds that will drive our performance and achievements of our new five-year plan.","In the quarter, we were encouraged to see that our organic sales growth accelerated to 3%. We saw continued improvement in our short cycle order rates quarter progress with steady growth in ESS, a return to growth in advanced materials especially in flooring products and a continued healthy pace of recovery in Transportation Systems.","Our robust long-cycle backlog which stands at 15.7 billion, up 4% from the end of last year, continues to support a favorable outlook with record orders for UOP and a continued uptick in new process solutions orders. We\u2019ve also seen a moderation of the sales declines in Defense and Space that we saw earlier in the year.","Speaking of D&S, I\u2019m encouraged to see that the headwinds are nearly behind us. We\u2019re expecting growth in D&S in the third quarter. In fact, we had 9% international growth in this last quarter. And early indications point to a modest increase next year.","We recently celebrated the sentential anniversary of innovation and leadership in the Aerospace and the oil and gas industries, two examples of where we have great positions and good industries. Honeywell Aerospace has been a pioneer in aviation for the last 100 years offering products and services that can be found on virtually every aircraft worldwide.","We\u2019ve led the way from the beginning with firsts, like the first autopilot, the first truly automatic flight management system and the first trans-Atlantic biofuel flight. And we have differentiated through disruptive technologies across our electrical and mechanical portfolios as well as our push at the global connectivity as you\u2019ve seen with recent partnership announcements with Inmarsat and AT&T.","In oil and gas where our UOP business created the first conversion technology for upgrading crude oil jumpstarting the modern oil refining industry, we\u2019re a driving force for innovation for the global petroleum and natural gas industries. Today, our leadership continues with new process technologies designed to get more valuable products from every barrel of oil, convert coal and natural gas into plastics and convert biofeed stocks such as algae into renewable fuels. We not only saw double-digit sales growth this quarter in UOP but record orders in backlogs, so the future continues to be promising.","Another innovation I\u2019d like to point out is our new Lyric thermostat designed for how people really live today. Using the location of your smartphone, the geofencing feature automatically turns the thermostat into energy saving mode when a home is empty. It senses when you\u2019re coming home and heats or cools the house to your preferred temperature. It\u2019s just another example of how the Honeywell user experience or HUE, depending upon how you want to pronounce it, enables us to move quickly to develop exciting new products that are easy to use, easy to maintain, easy to install and exceed customer needs.","ECC has seen continued good growth to the retail channel and that\u2019s up 40% in the second quarter. We think the portfolio is well positioned, aligned to favorable macro trends and there is significant runway to grow. We remain confident in our outlook for this year. As a result of our first half performance, we are raising the low end of our guidance again by $0.05, giving us a new pro forma EPS guidance range $5.45 to $5.55 or up 10% to 12% for the year.","The closing of the sale of Friction Materials was a significant step in positioning our existing portfolio for continued outperformance. We also realigned the Transportation Systems business segment into Aerospace to better take advantage of the engineering and technology similarities and the shared operating practices with two businesses. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the parts of Friction we\u2019re keeping will remain under Transportation Systems reported within Aerospace.","We just concluded our strategic planning reviews with our businesses and in these all-day sessions, each of our businesses presents their five-year strategic plan. While we\u2019re not expecting much help from the macro environment, I can tell you that each business has a strong roadmap for the 2018 targets we laid out for you back in March. The growth opportunities and new product pipeline are quite impressive.","We approached the finished line of our previous five-year targets confident in the strong foundation in place for continued outperformance. We have great positions in good industries. We\u2019re investing both organically and inorganically to grow faster than the markets we serve and we\u2019ll stay the course on seed planting and continuous improvement initiatives. We\u2019re going to stay flexible and deliver on 2014 and beyond.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. On Slide 4, let me walk you through the financial results for the second quarter. Sales of 10.3 billion were up approximately 6% on a reported basis. That\u2019s 3% organically. It came in just above the high-end of our guidance range. As we highlighted previously, the low first quarter organic growth was a bit of an anomaly with declines in Defense and Space and scanning mobility driving roughly two points of top line decline in the first quarter. As we signaled, these headwinds have dissipated.","The contributions in 2Q from the businesses were broad-based with each SPG sales growth at or above the guidance we had communicated. Regionally, organic sales were up 2% in the U.S. despite the drag from defense and space; 5% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 10% in China. In China we saw a good growth in our short-cycle businesses namely ESS and Transportation Systems in addition to continued long-cycle growth particularly in UOP and process solutions.","Once again, our quality of earnings was strong with most of the improvement coming from segment profit which increased 10% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%. That\u2019s 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A and 20 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. We had profit growth and margin expansion in all four businesses, so really a balanced contribution across the portfolio.","It\u2019s also notable that the better-than-expected performance from Intermec reduced the segment margin dilution from M&A in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see significant benefits from our productivity initiatives and proactive restructuring actions while continuing to invest for growth.","Items below segment profit were mostly as anticipated. You\u2019ll recall that in the second quarter of 2013, you\u2019ll recognize an OPEB curtailment gain of $42 million which was more than offset at the time by restructuring actions, so really no year-over-year net impact. In the second quarter of 2014, we funded 14 million of restructuring projects bringing the total for the year to approximately 100 million.","On a reported basis, the tax rate of 26.1% in the quarter represented a $0.06 headwind compared to the second quarter of 2013 and about a $0.01 tailwind relative to our guidance. EPS was $0.38, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range; $0.01 was from operations and $0.01 came from the better tax rate I mentioned.","EPS increased 8% on a reported basis or 12% when you normalize for the income tax rate. This was again driven by the 10% increase in segment profit, slightly more favorable below the line items and a minor benefit from lower share count.","Finally on free cash flow, approximately 1.1 billion in the quarter, 5% higher than 2013 and 101% conversion despite a 17% increase in CapEx and higher cash taxes. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 28% through the first half.","Moving to Slide 5, we\u2019re looking at Aerospace. Now this is prior to the realignment of Transportation Systems and Aerospace. We\u2019ll adopt that change in the third quarter. You\u2019ll also see us file an 8-K in the third quarter reflect this change on our historical reporting. So when it comes all the forward-looking guidance that I\u2019ll touch on later, we do reflect the new reporting structure.","So Aerospace sales were flat in the quarter which is in line with our guidance with 1% commercial sales growth offset by 1% decline in Defense and Space. Despite the challenging top line, segment margin was up 30 basis points driven by commercial excellence and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by BGA OEM payments, a higher mix of OE content and investments in growth programs.","The flat commercial OE sales reflect strong growth in large air transport driven by OE build rates offset by lower regional jet sales, engine shipment timing and higher BGA OEM payments. Now as a reminder, we have won significant content on a number of new OE platforms, and have and will continue to incur upfront costs as a result.","These costs are fully contemplated in the five-year planning we have shared with you and are accounting for these costs is very conservative compared to the industry. The Aerospace business model is fully intact and these wins coupled with the exciting new technology offerings in aero give us full confidence that the growth will accelerate over the five years in our plan.","Commercial aftermarket sales up 1% in the quarter with continued strong spares growth in both ATR and BGA. This strength was offset by lower R&O revenues, a reflection of fewer maintenance events and timing, particularly in business aviation. Aftermarket backlog levels in R&O along with robust spares demand underpinned an acceleration of aftermarket growth in 3Q.","Defense and Space sales were down 1% but a nice improvement from the 8% decline in the first quarter. U.S. defense aftermarket and government services declined significantly moderated from first quarter levels and growth in international markets, which Dave referenced earlier, helped to offset those declines. Defense and Space is tracking to a 3% decline for the full year.","On Slide 6 we\u2019re looking at ACS results for the second quarter. ACS sales were up 10% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis, in line with our expectations. The difference in the two rates principally reflects the contributions of Intermec. Looking at the businesses, ESS sales, so the products businesses, were up 4% organic with ECC and scanning and mobility showing particularly strong growth. ECC continues to benefit from strong residential end markets and new product introductions particularly in the retail channel. Dave talked about Lyric and overall the thermostat category is performing very well for us.","As for scanning and mobility, following the ramp-down of certain large programs in Q1, it returned a strong organic growth in the second quarter. New wins which ramped over the course of the year are driving sustained growth. Intermec also continues to perform very well, supplementing the growth we\u2019re seeing out of the core HSM business.","Our fire, safety and gas businesses have shown continued strength as well. On a regional basis, penetration of high growth regions remains a big driver of growth in ESS, as we saw strong double-digit growth in both China and the Middle East.","Moving to Building Solutions and Distribution, sales were up 2% with strength in the Americas distribution business offsetting pockets of weakness in Building Solutions, specifically the U.S. energy retrofit business. We are encouraged, however, as Building Solutions project and services backlog continues to grow.","I\u2019d like to take a minute to comment on what we\u2019re seeing in the commercial building sector. We\u2019ve seen modest improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter in the ESS products business as a service sector primarily ECC and fire, safety. We are anticipating further improvements in the second half.","In the Americas energy business, as I said, orders have been delayed due to financing and municipal contract holdup. While the projects can be lumpy, we are seeing bid activity heating up, especially in the Middle East and China and energy efficient projects globally. This along with the easing of year-over-year comps gives us confidence that our commercial building related sales will modestly accelerate in the second half.","Moving to ACS margins, expansion of 50 basis points to 14.8% in the quarter, up 80 basis points including M&A. ACS continues to benefit from productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence as well as higher volume while also continuing to invest for future growth.","Moving to Slide 7, Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT sales were 2.6 billion, up 6% organic and we\u2019re above the high-end of our guidance, driven primarily by stronger than expected results in UOP. UOP sales increased 17% in the quarter, driven by increased catalysts and gas processing sales reflecting continued strong refining, petrochemical and gas markets.","UOP had a record quarter for both orders and backlog which currently stands at 2.6 billion. We saw a continuation of orders for [transient] (ph) gas processing particularly with Thomas Russell. So continued benefit in UOP from oil and gas investments occurring globally.","In process solutions, sales were flat on an organic basis primarily driven by a couple of large projects completed in the prior period, offsetting growth across the remainder of the portfolio and high margin areas like services and advanced software solutions. Process solutions orders growth accelerated in the quarter, up approximately 7% organic and as we will preview, modest sales acceleration is expected in the second half of the year.","Advanced Material Sales increased 5% in the quarter. We saw volume increases across the businesses with particular strength in flooring products, driven by new global warming molecule offering. These volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable pricing particularly in Resins and Chemicals as we\u2019ve been signaling. We expect these pricing headwinds to moderate in the second half of the year.","Segment margins for PMT were up 30 basis points to 18% consistent with our expectation, driven by productivity net of inflation and higher volume partially offset by price, raw headwinds and Resins and Chemicals, unfavorable UOP catalyst shipment mix and continued investments for growth.","On Slide 8 you can see Transportation Systems which again to remind you includes Friction Materials for the second quarter. TS had another strong quarter with sales up 8%, that\u2019s 4% without foreign exchange and segment margin expansion of 310 basis points. The sales increase was primarily driven by turbo volume growth across our three largest regions; Europe, North America and China. In each of these regions, our volume growth outpaced auto production.","The growth we\u2019re seeing in Europe was strong in both the light and commercial vehicle segments. We\u2019ve benefited from an uptick in European commercial vehicle demand primarily driven by the Euro 6 regulation shift in the region. Outside of Europe, both North America and China saw strong volume increases in light vehicles both diesel and gas, which more than offset lower commercial vehicle volume sales in those regions.","In North America specifically, commercial off-highway sales remained soft consistent with trends in mining and agriculture segments. Overall, we continue to benefit from improving global industrial macros on vehicle production, regulation, turbo penetration and our strong win rates.","As we begin to lap the strong second half performance in 2013, however, we do expect some moderation in these growth rates beginning in 4Q 2014. The segment margin improvement to 16.4% reflects the strong productivity and a volume leverage in turbo and the benefits from restructuring and other operational improvements.","With the closing of the Friction Materials divestiture behind us, let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 and walk through our guidance for the third quarter under our new reporting structure. We\u2019re expecting sales of 9.9 billion to 10.1 billion which will be up 3% to 5% reported or 3% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up approximately 50 basis points and earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.42, up 10% to 15% from the prior year.","For Aerospace, as I indicated earlier, we are providing guidance under the new reporting structure with Transportation Systems included. Sales growth on a reported basis is expected to be flat to down 2% in the quarter, reflecting the year-over-year absence of Friction Materials sales in the quarter. On an organic basis or in other words without the Friction business, sales are expected to be up approximately 2% to 3% with growth across the portfolio; Commercial, Defense and Space and Transportation Systems.","In Commercial, OE sales are expected to be approximately flat year-over-year with continued growth in ATR offsetting declines in BGA similar to the second quarter. However, we are expecting acceleration in aftermarket growth in the quarter, up low single digit driven by continued spares strength and higher airline maintenance event. We\u2019re also expecting to see a return to growth in Defense and Space, as Dave indicated, up low to mid single digits where international programs continue to drive growth. ","In Transportation Systems, we\u2019re expecting mid single digit organic sales growth in the quarter and as for margins we expect an increase of approximately 150 basis points with significant contributions from both the Aerospace and TS businesses. For ACS, sales are expected to be up between 8% and 10% or 3% to 4% on an organic basis. And as a reminder, we closed Intermec in the third quarter of 2013, so this will be the last quarter of M&A impact from that transaction.","Organically, we expect continued mid single digit growth in ESS and improvement in BSD. Our short-cycle orders have been trending up at ESS and the backlog is growing in Building Solutions. Both trends bode well for our third quarter outlook. ACS margins are expected to be up approximately 20 basis points or approximately 40 basis points excluding the dilutive impact from M&A. ACS continues to ramp their investment for growth in new products as well as adding speed on the street as we continue to further penetrate high growth regions.","In PMT, sales are expected to increase between 4% and 6% in the third quarter. In UOP we foresee another quarter of increased catalyst growth, however, similar to the first half, product mix in Q3 will result in a headwind for UOP margins. As a reminder, UOP sales can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of product and as such we are forecasting a sales decline of approximately 10% in the fourth quarter for UOP against a much more challenging comp. However, our outlook for the year remains intact for mid single digit growth in UOP and with the record orders in backlog we experienced in Q2, we expect strong growth to continue over our five-year plan.","In HPS, after several quarters in a row of strong orders growth, we\u2019re expecting to see sales accelerate in the back half of the year carrying into 2015 with continued strong margin expansion. The increased orders growth will really start to show in the fourth quarter as we\u2019re expecting high single digit sales growth for HPS.","In Advanced Materials, we anticipate another quarter of broad sales growth across the portfolio including improved production levels in Resins and Chemicals and increased sales of global warming products and flooring products. Overall, TMT segment margins are expected to be up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting similar trends that we explained for Q2 with the exception that pricing pressures in Advanced Materials are expected to moderate.","Let me move to Slide 10 where I\u2019d like to take a moment to refresh our 2014 segment outlook. This guidance reflects the realignment of Transportation Systems and Aerospace as well the transition of process solutions into PMT that occurred in 2Q. Let me explain the setup here. The left half represents the guidance we provided in April, so with process solutions already in PMT but prior to the sale of Friction Materials and prior to the movement of TS. The right side reflects our current outlook including the Friction Materials divestiture and the realignment of Transportation Systems in Aero.","At the bottom of the page you can see our new sales guidance which reflects the absence of approximately 300 million Friction Materials sales in the second half and our increased segment margins guidance for the year driven by our strong first half performance and the margin accretion we will experience from the absence of Friction Materials sales in the second half.","There are some comparable dynamics to be aware of as you think about the full year. First, in Aerospace with the inclusion of Transportation Systems, we\u2019re expecting 4Q sales to be down low single digit on a reported basis but up about 1% to 2% on an organic basis driven primarily by the timing of OE shipments in our air transport business. However, you can see the significant margin expansion we\u2019re expecting this year with contributions from both Aerospace and Transportation Systems businesses.","Also, as I referenced, we expect a decline in 4Q sales in UOP, all timing and comp related. And I want to reiterate that we anticipate another year of good growth in 2015 from UOP given of the significant multiyear backlog we\u2019re building in it. There are some minor puts and takes but no real changes to ACS or PMT from their prior outlooks with continued margin expansion in both businesses.","Turning to the next slide, Slide 11, you can see the basis for the 3Q, 4Q and raised full year guidance. Full year sales are now expected to be 40.2 billion to 40.4 billion, reflecting first half performance and a modest organic sales acceleration in the second half. Estimated full year sales are lower at the midpoint from our previous guidance reflecting the absence of approximately 300 million of Friction Materials sales in the second half.","So on an organic basis, we continue to expect about 3% growth for the full year. Although acceleration is expected in the second half, most notably in Defense and Space, process solutions and Advanced Materials, we will see tougher comps in the fourth quarter, specifically in UOP and Aerospace as I mentioned. As you\u2019ll recall, we saw strong acceleration in organic growth at the end of 2013 with growth of 5% in the fourth quarter of last year.","On segment margin, we\u2019ve increased our full year guidance and now expect 16.8% to 17%, up about 60 basis points at the midpoint versus last year. On EPS, we\u2019re raising the bottom end of our pro forma guidance by $0.05 taking the new range $5.45 to $5.55 or increase to 10% to 12% versus the prior year. We are planning for a 26.5% tax rate in 3Q with 4Q just slightly higher to get to our full planning assumption of 26.5%. So, overall, we feel like we\u2019re executing well and delivering on the high end of our 2014 commitment.","I\u2019m now on Slide 12 and before wrapping up, I want to give you an update on our new five-year plan of 2018. On a total Honeywell basis, the targets are identical with those we shared at the March Investor Day. However, the individual components now reflect our new business segment reporting structure. So even with the Friction Materials divestiture, the overall Honeywell targets are identical to those originally communicated. We\u2019re continuing to target a 4% to 6% organic sales CAGR and segment margin in the range of 18.5% to 20% by 2018, which is 220 to 370 basis points improvement from 2013; strong earnings growth which you come to expect from Honeywell.","On the left side of the page, you can see the previous outlook by business based on our old reporting structure. Moving to the right side of the page, our current targets now reflect the combined Aerospace and Transportation Systems businesses, less Friction Materials, as well as HPS transitioned to PMT. So minor puts and takes but overall very consistent with what you\u2019ve heard in March and a significant contribution across the portfolio.","As Dave continues to emphasize the growth and margin story, it doesn\u2019t end in 2018. Each of our businesses still has significant runway based on the continued evolution of our internal processes, global growth and execution and the value we add for the customer through innovation and the Honeywell user experience, so even more to come.","Let me finish on Slide 13. The second quarter results put us another step closer to delivering on the high expectations for 2014 we laid out in December. The pace of acceleration in organic growth over the course of the quarter gives us confidence in our second half outlook where we expect a modest uptick in organic growth and a continuation of strong productivity. We\u2019re going to keep investing for our future focused on our new five-year plan, innovation and new product introductions which are the lifeblood of our growth remain a key priority, as well as the investments we\u2019re making to further penetrate high growth regions.","We feel confident that our balance portfolio mix, alignment to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will enable us to continue to outperform and we\u2019re focused on executing sustainable restructuring productivity actions including delivering on the strong restructuring project pipeline we\u2019ve already fund.","So with that, Elena, let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Tom. Leo will now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hi.","Scott Davis - Barclays","You didn\u2019t really talk much about M&A in the release, right, I\u2019d say not at all, but Roger Fradin now has had a couple of months in the role. I mean, can you give us a sense of how he\u2019s progressing as far as pipeline and changing the M&A process and your confidence in being able to do deals in the next 12 months?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, Scott, I\u2019m happy to answer that. As you know, historically, our approach to M&A has been really a bottoms-up process from the businesses. So each business has resources, it has an action plan to maintain a robust portfolio of M&A targets and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing generate the deals that are done over here. And as you alluded to, did the appointment of Roger into the Vice Chairman\u2019s role and one of the things Dave tends to do was to focus with our M&A team on the pipeline and that portfolio. So we\u2019ve kind of gotten a top sound focus from Roger in addition to the process that we\u2019ve had in our history. So, what you\u2019ve got is you\u2019ve got two ways of looking at it and when you look across the portfolio, we are seeing quite a bit of interest as a result of this process. As you know, we\u2019re quite active in looking at potential deals in Aerospace, ACS and in PMT and I think that activity will continue.","David M. Cote","For what it\u2019s worth, Scott, Tom has also said he enjoys having Roger report to him on that.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Well, good luck. We\u2019ll be watching closely on that. But, guys, can you give us a better sense \u2013 I mean I\u2019ve struggled to understand this business for a lot of years and I\u2019m talking about UOP and kind of the quarter-by-quarter variability. I mean it\u2019s a fantastic business but I have no idea how you forecast or how you \u2013 you\u2019re really having in confidence one quarter to the next in that regard. But how does a business like that have such a strong quarter without there being an inventory build or some sort of \u2013 something going on at the customer level that may come back and bite you in the tail in a quarter or two? I mean I just don\u2019t understand it I guess.","David M. Cote","I\u2019ll answer first and turn it over to Tom, but I\u2019d say on an annual basis it\u2019s pretty forecastable. They don\u2019t have a lot of inventory to have to fool with in the first place. A lot of this is a technology sale. I mean there is some inventory but not a huge amount. It\u2019s between quarters that can be more variable but even that variability is generally forecastable. It\u2019s just that you can end up with lumpiness when it comes to one quarter versus another, but we generally have a pretty good handle on what\u2019s going out the door.","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I think Dave hit it on the head, Scott. It is quite lumpy but because of the long-cycle nature of it and we referenced the backlog earlier. I mean we had a record backlog 2.6 billion, up double digit from last year and we have good insight into what\u2019s going to happen quarter-over-quarter and that backlog dissipates and will end up in our P&L over a fairly short timeframe, a year and a half to two years. So, we do feel like we have a good track on forecasting that.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. And last just quickly. Guys, we used to think about \u2013 in TS we used to think about turbo as being one of those businesses that was kind of 600 basis points over to auto SAR, maybe a little bit better in some quarters, maybe a little bit worst. But has that changed at all? I mean is there a different thought process in how that grows versus auto SAR globally?","Tom Szlosek","Well, we do end up with a regional mix difference that can impact us, because we\u2019ve got a strong position in Euro diesel and that was one of the things that really helped us with that industry bottoming out this year, so all the wins finally started to show up as opposed to mitigating the decline we were seeing in Euro auto. But overall, yes, it\u2019s going to continue to grow well for a long time.","David M. Cote","Yes, I mean I guess what I\u2019d say is that I reemphasize that the growth profile that we\u2019ve got going, I mean it\u2019s in all of our big regions; I mean in North America both on the diesel and gas side with strong double digit growth, China\u2019s strong double digit growth on both diesel and gas as well and Europe\u2019s doing pretty well as well and the commercial vehicle side in Europe particularly is very strong.","Scott Davis - Barclays","But that\u2019s 600 basis points above SAR, I mean is that changed or are you punting on the answer?","Elena Doom","Scott, I would say that you\u2019re seeing light vehicle production in the quarter was flat and so for turbo we had organic growth of 5%, so 500 basis points was within that range.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, good. That\u2019s what I really wanted to know. Thanks guys. Good quarter and thanks. Good luck.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Thanks and good morning, everybody.","David M. Cote","Hi, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Dave, just an initial question on that turbo move and transport to Aero, how much is cost a part of that or should I say how much cost reduction are you expecting from de-layering? Is there any in there in addition to the technology justification?","David M. Cote","No, not really. In fact, our turbo business is pretty lean already and I\u2019m hoping when we reference operating practices in the release, I\u2019m hoping for more leanness to transfer into the Aero business looking at turbo as a model.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So the rationale here is sort of subscale in existing \u2013 separate reporting segment now. Obviously the technology is always overlapped but you could have gotten that otherwise and maybe some practice opportunities here. Is that how I should think about it?","David M. Cote","I might modify that a bit. I agree on size. Subscale, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d call it that. Including that industry their scale is quite good. On the technology side, it\u2019s one thing to tell two businesses that, hey, would you guys cooperate but I could say over 12 years there\u2019s been an evolution there. It used to be the Aero business wanted to charge the turbo business $200,000 per person for cooperation. Yes, you might remember those days. Things have changed a lot and we\u2019ve progressed to the point where we co-locate engineers, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past. That being said, you still get a different dynamic when you put the businesses together. We\u2019re putting them together in a way that allows us to get much further advantage on that technology benefit that we have with Aero technology because turbo is just a derivation of a jet engine and we\u2019re the only guys who have that. We want to take further advantage of it, but I\u2019m also hoping for a lot more of those lean practices to transition into Aero, because the Aerospace industry is, let\u2019s say, right with opportunity when it comes to running more leanly than it does today. And while I\u2019m pretty proud of what we\u2019ve been able to do, where we\u2019ve been able to get to it, at the end of the day I think there is still one hell of a lot more opportunity there for us and this is a good way to have best practices in-house that they can be looking at.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And speaking of moving organizationally to drive better financial results, HPS within PMT now, but just maybe talk about the projects that are completed? It\u2019s down 1% flat organic, but again this sort of North American build out that suggest that they\u2019re very, very early stages. What are you seeing there? Any hopes that we should anticipate a ramp up soon?","Tom Szlosek","Steve, like we said, first of all there is a lot of excitement around the combination of those two businesses and we do think that marketwise it\u2019s going to enable us to better serve the common customer base that\u2019s there. I think you\u2019re referring specifically to HPS. I mean the second quarter orders were very strong, up 7% on an organic basis and that\u2019s another quarter of pretty good growth for them on the order side. As I said, that hasn\u2019t factored into our full year guidance, UOP as well. As I said, both orders and backlog are strong. Talked about the lumpiness, but the same trajectory. Both of those businesses [really fits] (ph). And unlike the TS1 that Dave said, I do hope we get a little bit of productivity out of that combination as well.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And just lastly, you mentioned you just wrapped up the STRAP process. Again, just remind me, what macro assumptions did you give the business, the STUs to use for the five-year plan in terms of top line base growth?","Tom Szlosek","I think we used the global insights, GDP forecast like 3%...","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","Tom Szlosek","About 3% to 3.5% is kind of the assumption globally.","David M. Cote","I mean a lot different than what we said back in March just because I don\u2019t think that much has changed since that time.","Tom Szlosek","I think the FX, we assume at about 30.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thank you. I\u2019ll hand it off.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning.","David M. Cote","Hi, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","How bad is UOP going to be in the fourth quarter?","David M. Cote","What an interesting way to put it. I don\u2019t know whether I would say it is bad, I would say it\u2019s all contemplated within our fourth quarter guidance which you can see churned up pretty well for the year. I don\u2019t know Tom if there\u2019s anything else you want to add there?","Tom Szlosek","No, I mean full year UOP will be 5% as I said, down 8% in the fourth quarter. First quarter was 9%, the past quarter was 17%. We\u2019ll see mid single digits in the third quarter and probably 8% to 10% down in the fourth quarter. But full year we remain on track and again that order and backlog should be very strong.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes, I don\u2019t think there is an issue with trend of the business, I\u2019m just trying to kind of reconcile the 3% organic growth you did this quarter and the only thing that really seems to be getting worst just on lumpiness or a quarterly basis, whatever is in the math, would be UOP. I mean everything actually seems to be looking better like accelerating and so I\u2019m just kind of like the 3% organic even with UOP which is dramatic with 8% is a pretty big number. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that 3% you did this quarter versus why with things getting better, why that should be 3% in the fourth quarter?","Elena Doom","I think we also mentioned that we do have other softer comps, in particular Aerospace for OE and also the Transportation Systems relative to both were up mid teens in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. But I mean you didn\u2019t really grow in commercial Aero this quarter, so are you going to be done in commercial Aero in the fourth quarter?","Elena Doom","Our ATR OE growth this quarter was [over 6] (ph).","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. So there was \u2013 the jet stuff kind of offset that, okay.","David M. Cote","Your thesis, Steve, is not \u2013 the way you\u2019re talking about it seems reasonable.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right, okay. And then I guess I\u2019m just going to ask this every quarter and this quarter was particularly interesting because DuPont preannounced negatively and I got a flood of emails about R-22 pricing. I don\u2019t really get chemicals \u2013 the question is around chemicals pricing for a lot of the other companies that I follow and with the re-segmentation you just did, you kind of went to a little less disclosure which I don\u2019t particularly view as a good thing. Is this the final kind of iteration of outside of acquisitions of what the portfolio looks like or could we maybe breakout the more process kind of oil and gas related businesses and maybe again kind of at some point evaluate this chemical business as a part of the Honeywell portfolio?","David M. Cote","I would say in terms of our organization, I kind of like it just the way it is now.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, so no change.","David M. Cote","No.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, thanks.","David M. Cote","If it was you couldn\u2019t expect me to say anything anyway, Steve, so\u2026","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","It\u2019s my job to ask the question. Thanks.","David M. Cote","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, folks.","David M. Cote","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Hi. How is it going? Could we get a little more color on the commercial building for U.S. specifically? The color Tom gave I think it was global and helpful but I\u2019m going to lay the land on U.S. specifically if you have it?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I would say Jeff the growth in the products business that are serving commercial buildings are reasonable, I mean mid single digits in the second quarter. I expect that to continue for the remainder of the year if not accelerate a little bit more modestly. In terms of the pure building solutions business, the business in the U.S. was tempered a bit by the energy business. We have a couple of really large projects completed since 2013 that tempered the sale. In terms of the orders broke there, it\u2019s flat globally but on the Americas side it\u2019s been picking up to mid to high single digits.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Mid to high single digit U.S. energy retrofit but global flat on orders?","Tom Szlosek","Yes.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thank you. And I was just wondering, Dave, if you could address Europe a little bit more specifically? I think the plus 5 was in an EMEA comment. That was kind of core Europe actually doing and was running a slowdown in Europe in the quarter in June that you noticed?","David M. Cote","Overall, what kind of interesting is our Europe orders have actually done okay as you\u2019ve been hearing us say for the last two or three quarters. So I\u2019m a little surprised actually given that the overall economy doesn\u2019t perform all that well and we don\u2019t have a lot of expectation to the economy to perform all that well over the, say, next two or three years. That being said, our orders were okay there.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And just one final one from me and I\u2019ll move on, perhaps too granular for this call, but are you seeing any signs of kind of toppiness, pressure in the commercial helicopter market?","David M. Cote","No, I don\u2019t think so. We actually think that\u2019s going to be a pretty good market for a while.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Yes. Just some cautionary comments out of Eurocopter this week and Farm Bureau and some toppiness at [Bell] (ph) also. Maybe it\u2019s just some noise in the quarter\u2026","David M. Cote","I\u2019m not sure what their expectation was either but I\u2019d say overall we still think that\u2019s a growth market.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Great. Thank you, guys. Take care.","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Good morning.","David M. Cote","Hi, Howard.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","How are you?","David M. Cote","Good.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Number look nice.","David M. Cote","Thank you.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","A couple of things. You never stop pushing excellence and while Friction Materials is the last obvious divestiture, how do you think about keeping the guys at the back of the line equal with the people outperforming at the front?","David M. Cote","Well, that\u2019s something we pay a lot of attention to all the time and in several different ways. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing that more in the future is through this HOS Gold effort that you\u2019ve heard us talk about and as especially as we go through the planning or what we call STRAP exercise, we spent a lot of time looking at that. And I can\u2019t say that we look at it with threatened to fail if they don\u2019t kind of come up to par, but at the end of the day I\u2019d say I\u2019m really encouraged by the upside I see across the portfolio and the implementation of HOS Gold and the ability to raise sales growth and margin rates everywhere.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then kind of staying with that theme, you\u2019re spending a lot of money on new products and you highlighted a couple of them in ACS. Can you sort of talk about, are you getting the productivity you want and are there \u2013 how do you think about maybe \u2013 how much of this is contributing to organic growth as opposed to just the normal economy?","Tom Szlosek","Sorry, to products or productivity, Howard?","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Well, I guess I\u2019ll mix them both. I mean one is the productivity associated with new product development and then second is how is that contributing to the organic growth, Tom?","Tom Szlosek","First off, if you look at it in pure financial metrics, we\u2019re not decelerating at all on investment with new product. For example, if you look at R&D investments it\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s not per se generating productivity, but when you look at productivity across direct materials and our people costs, I would say that has been as strong as it has been in the last couple of years which is the way I look at it.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then last, Intermec, looks like you\u2019re getting the top line you expected. How would you evaluate where you are in terms of the integration process and when do we really see its profitability normalize with the rest of the business units?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I\u2019d say, Howard, the way we look at that one is a year ago everybody \u2013 when we closed the deal it was a business that was not very profitable at all and you fast forward to now and if you look at what we\u2019ve done just to look at the multiple that we pay in Intermec today and you would say we\u2019re at 17, 18 times multiple. And you factor in synergies it\u2019s gotten and that are in place, we\u2019re down to sub 5 type multiples. It kind of gives you an idea that we feel like we\u2019ve been successful. So when you look at the plan itself, when you look at both revenues and the income and the cash, all of those metrics were performing a lot better than the plans. John and his team with Scanning and Mobility as well as the Intermec have really have done a nice job integrating those two businesses.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote","Hi, John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. So how did your businesses \u2013 I realize it\u2019s not a huge exposure but how did your businesses fair in Latin America and the (indiscernible) does market weakness in Latin America, Dave Cote, maybe provide you an opportunity perhaps with respect to capital and deployment or step up some investment spending there or something like that?","David M. Cote","We continue to do very well with everything south of the Rio Grande and you look at the big ones; Mexico and Brazil, we continue to do well there. Mexico, we\u2019ve got about 14,000 employees. In Brazil we\u2019ve got about 1,000 and our sales have been quite good there. In terms of investing, I still think that there are places where you think about it before you do it. It\u2019s not a no-brainer. But overall those have been very good markets for us.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Your Brazilian business is up in the quarter?","David M. Cote","Yes.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Defense and Space, were there any pockets of Defense and Space or expectations of Defense and Space pockets like within the framework of that business that you expect to actually get better over the course of the year? And I\u2019m curious kind of how if anything has changed with respect to how you were seeing this business, how are you\u2019re going to manage it? I\u2019m assuming it kind of gets managed down over time, but maybe not?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, John, the way I think of the Defense and Space business is it has two pieces of products business where we\u2019re dealing with the U.S. government and\/or the prime contractors. And then there\u2019s the service business that\u2019s largely unrelated to the Aerospace industry and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the most pressure. Thankfully it\u2019s a lower margin business, but that\u2019s where the top line for Defense and Space are the most pronounced for us. We\u2019re now approaching periods where we\u2019re going to start lapping comps, so that pressure will subside. The other thing we\u2019ve got going on there is the international side. If you\u2019ve read the paper this morning, I mean unfortunately those things happen but that tends to bode well for military budgets outside of the U.S. and so we\u2019re seeing an uptick, as Dave referenced, in sales in the international side of Defense and Space. So you got some balancing dynamics going there. I think they\u2019ll net to the positive as we head into the second half of the year.","David M. Cote","The other thing to recognize, John, is as we\u2019ve said before, Defense is really more of a sales channel for us. It\u2019s not like we have \u2013 while the jet engine might be unique to a certain defense application, at the end of the day it\u2019s still coming out of a jet engine factory that also produced in commercial.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Right, and all incremental. Maybe one more. Global markets, Dave Cote, kind of do not begin to show more signs of life. I realize you\u2019re outperforming today but let\u2019s call it over the course of the coming year. Does that cause you to perhaps modify or even accelerate aspects of your operating framework to hit or totally exceed your five-year targets?","David M. Cote","Well, as you know, I\u2019ve been one the guys who has generally been more negative on the global outlook for the last four years and so far it has been a pretty good call. So I\u2019d say the way we\u2019ve forecasted this year and the way we\u2019ve looked at our five-year plan is pretty consistent with that. I never counted on much and so far it has been a good call. So I feel pretty good about where we are and what we\u2019re saying.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thanks. Good morning.","David M. Cote","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","Hi there.","David M. Cote","Your brother-in-law Tom says hi.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thanks for passing that along. I got a text from him last night.","Tom Szlosek","I guess this is going to be an easy question.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","We\u2019ll see. So I wanted to follow-up on the M&A and part of Roger\u2019s job now I think is the opportunity to look at sourcing larger deals and we see the Intermec integration was pretty rapid fire with the benefits. So, I\u2019m wondering are you just starting to develop the pipeline for larger deals or is that something that\u2019s already kind of established?","Tom Szlosek","There\u2019s been a conservative effort to find larger deals with Roger joining in that area. I do think that he has the tendency and the license and idea of looking across Honeywell and trying to identify opportunities that might touch on more than one business or that might be an adjacent to the three business segments that we have. That might lead you to think there is larger deals in the making. But I would say that\u2019s not the primary objective. The primary objective is to augment those existing portfolios and find good growth ideas that are in industries alike.","David M. Cote","I\u2019d add, Chris, that while we did an okay job on origination, as Roger started to get into this around the company looking at it within the businesses, across the businesses and adjacencies that might make sense, he\u2019s really invigorating the overall kind of origination process. But I think it\u2019s going to give us a lot more ideas to work with than what we\u2019ve had in the past. And you\u2019ve heard us talk about many times that we have and want even more of a robust pipeline. If the more ideas you have, the more stuff you can go after, the more opportunities it gives you and it also allows you to be more selective. You can end up being I\u2019d say in a much better position to negotiate if you have nine other good deals that you can\u2019t do so that you don\u2019t do something silly when it comes to pricing.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","Right. Well, we haven\u2019t seen that be a problem, so I think our bias then would be more to higher frequency of deals in your accelerated capital allocation rather than seeing something larger.","David M. Cote","Well, I guess it depends how you define larger but I would say \u2013 you have heard me say many times we never say never on any of this because it\u2019s going to depend upon the construct of the deal. But whatever we do I can promise you we\u2019ll be consistent with the financial and operating discipline model that we\u2019ve talked about in the past and we\u2019ll have strong cost synergies that come out of it consistent with Tom\u2019s point of Intermec because that certainly is one of the things that I think has helped define our track record.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Elena Doom","Leo, we have time for just one more question.","Operator","Very good. We\u2019ll take a question from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Just a little bit more color on UOP and HPS. Could you just comment more on petchem demand by region because we\u2019re hearing mix commentary this earnings season?","Tom Szlosek","UOP by region?","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, and HPS as it seems that some pieces of oil and gas and petchem industry are moving in different directions. Just trying to get what you guys are seeing.","Elena Doom","It\u2019s really broad based I think if you move across all the regions. I mean oil and gas has been particularly strong in the U.S., the Middle East, China in particular. Anything, Tom, you could add there?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I would say the Middle East has been outstanding for both UOP and HPS and China\u2019s [lending] (ph) those were very good. But it\u2019s not like the U.S. is\u2026","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a question on Aerospace, you sort of noted that RMU\u2019s growth is moderating and I think you guys were positive. Can you just talk about what\u2019s happening there and any sort of broader trends that are taking place?","Tom Szlosek","Well, I think on RMUs the sales levels are very strong. It\u2019s just that we had such an uptick in the early and middle part of 2013 and really into '14 that we\u2019re starting to lap through that are really strong, but we\u2019re sustaining the level of new product development there and the offerings, they\u2019re going on to those platforms particularly on BGA side particularly as it relates to software.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot.","Elena Doom","Well, thank you for your participation today. I do want to turn the call over to Dave Cote for any final comments.","David M. Cote","Well, we\u2019re quite pleased with our second quarter results and our outlook for the year and I think it\u2019s a good reflection of our expectations for ourselves over the next five years. We have a great portfolio to grow with, our process initiatives continue to progress and our culture provides sustainability as we evolve and continue the seed planting. We\u2019re building on a great base and with the addition of our drive for HOS Gold, software including CMMI level 5 and HUE, we see a lot of good things to come from Honeywell.

","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek. As a reminder this call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements in this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance and our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the second quarter, highlight some key wins across our business and share our guidance for the third quarter of '17. And our updated guidance for the full year and as always, we will leave ample time for your questions at the end.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Today, we reported another quarter of strong performance in each of our businesses either meeting or exceeding the sales guidance we provided in April. Organic sales growth exceeded the high end of our guidance range at over 3% and good results in all four business segments. Our performance in the aerospace after market continued and our U.S. defense business improved as we anticipated.","In advance materials, when performance materials and technologies recorded another quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by the continued adoption of our Solstice line of low global warming products. And in the Home and Building technologies, we exhibited strong revenue growth at approximately 4% organic.","We also expanded margins by 50 basis points this quarter driven by commercial excellence and productivity leading to earnings per share that came in at the high end of our guidance range of $1.80 and up 10% from 2016 on a basis consistent of our guidance.","Our second quarter tax rate was lower than initially anticipated and this enabled us to invest more than $115 million in restructuring and other projects that\u2019s $90 million higher than we contemplated in the guidance. These projects start delivering cost savings for us later this year and ultimately result more than $150 million in run rate savings.","Excluding this additional $90 million of restructuring funding in 2016 earnings from last year\u2019s divestitures on a normalized for tax basis, earnings per share grew 10% year-over-year. I\u2019m pleased of our continued performance especially organic sales growth momentum, which is a testament to the growth investments we made new technologies, platforms, production capacity and M&A. We are raising our full year sales guidance to a new range of $39.3 billion to $40 billion up 2% to 4% organic and again raising the loan of our earnings guidance today.","2017 earnings per share is now expected to be between $7 and $7.10. Tom will take you through the details shortly. Each of our businesses made significant progress in our key initiatives this quarter, and I\u2019d like to provide some brief highlights.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. In aerospace, our suite of connected aircraft offering continues to gain traction. We announced that GoDirect connected maintenance, which combines our connectivity, in depth product knowledge, and data analytics to predict when mechanic parts need to be fixed or replaced will be used on the auxiliary volumes [ph] of 60 of Cathay's Airbus A330 aircraft. The agreement was a result of a successful trial, which saved Cathay Pacific several hundred thousand dollars in operational and reactive maintenance cost per aircraft and reduced APU related delays by 51%. ","In Home and Building technologies, we launched the Lyric C1 Wi-Fi security camera, the latest in our growing line of do-it-yourself offerings that can help make them smarter and serve our faster growing segment of the market. The C1 can be setup easily using a Lyric app on your mobile device and it offers intelligent sound and motion detection. Since its launch last month, the C1 camera has already generated more than 1 million in sales and more than 80% of reviewers are recommending it. We are in exciting pipeline of other new products in Home and Building technologies, that will roll out over the latter half of the year.","In performance materials and technologies, we announced the agreement to acquire Nextnine, a leading provider of CyberSecurity solutions for industrial sites. Nextnine has an impressive installed base of more than 6,000 sites around the world and is especially strong in the oil and gas, utility, chemical and mining manufacturing sectors. We are exciting about the combination of Nextnine of growing CyberSecurity business with Honeywell process solutions. Nextnine broadens our offerings for an installed base while complementing our broader offerings in connected plant. ","Lastly, in safety and productivity solutions, we introduced connected freight which was developed with Intel and third party Logistic companies. Connected freight can help shippers and logistic companies monitor a high value in perishable goods to prevent damage and loss. ","Sensor tags are fixed too pallets [ph] or packages and they send real-time information about the location and condition of critical freight while in transit. Our connected offerings continue to gain traction and feedback from our customers have been extremely positive. Our evolution as a software industrial leader is well underway and I'm encouraged by our progress. ","With that, I'll turn over to Tom to discuss our financial results in more detail. ","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Darius. Good morning, I'm on slide 4. As Darius mentioned we achieved more than 3% organic sales growth in the second quarter. The guidance was zero to 2%. The momentum continued from the first quarter with all of our businesses either meeting or exceeding their sales guidance. ","Segment profit was $1.9 billion, that was up 6% excluding the impact from our 2016 divestitures. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points from 2016, that was driven by volume leverage and commercial excellence, as well as our continued focus on productivity and returns from previously executed restructuring projects. ","Earnings per share were $1.80, our second quarter tax rate was 21.3%, lower than we originally expected due to higher than anticipated employee stock option exercises. But this favorable impact was offset by provisions for additional restructuring projects beyond what we anticipated in the original guidance. These investments will drive further growth and productivity mostly starting in 2018. Excluding those investments, and earnings from our 2016 divestitures and normalized for tax to 25% in both periods, earnings per share was up 10% year-over-year. ","Our free cash flow momentum continues with strong operational performance in each of our segments. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 39% from 2016, despite approximately $300 million more in timing related income tax payments. Overall, it was another quarter of strong operational performance. ","Let's move to slide 5, to discuss our segments in more detail. Let me start with aerospace which delivered a very strong quarter in both sales and profit. Aerospace sales growth was 2 percentage points above the high end of our guidance. Strength in the commercial aftermarket continued this quarter with strong repair and overhaul activity, growing sales of retrofits modifications and upgrades, and robust fares demand in the air transport and regional segment. ","The business in general aviation aftermarket was also up, primarily driven by timing of customer demand. Overall, aftermarket sales grew 5% this quarter. The OE dynamics, we've talked about in the last quarter continued with market related weakness in business and general aviation and slowing shipments for the legacy air transport and air transport platforms, partially offset by growth in new platforms. Overall, OE sales were down 5%. ","Defense sales were up 5%, -- I'm sorry, defense sales were up 2% driven by deliveries related to the F-35 program, and sensors and guidance systems within the U.S. defense segment. This was partially offset by continued weakness in the space and commercial helicopter markets as we anticipated. ","In transportation systems, growth was driven by continued recovery of the commercial vehicles market demand especially strong for on highway turbos in the U.S., Europe and China. The China growth was driven by new regulations that restrict the weight of commercial vehicles spurring demand for turbo charger technology that can provide more power to smaller size engines. This is the trend we expect to continue for the remainder of 2017. ","Aerospace segment margin expansion of 140 basis points for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by that higher sales volume as well as productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of the 2016 divestiture of the government services business. ","Home and Building Technologies performance was mixed with strong organic sales but lower than anticipated margin rate growth. HBT organic sales grew 4% at the high end of the guidance range driven by both products and distribution. Within products we executed several large smart meter program rollouts. We saw continued strong demand for clean air and water products in China and we delivered nice growth within our Home's business in North America. The sales growth acceleration and the products segment were also encouraging. Distribution continued to perform well with strength in both Honeywell building solutions and global distributions. Order were up 5% up in building solutions and backlog was up double digit, so we expect growth in this business to continue. ","Segment margin for HBT was below our expectations coming in flat for the quarter, we continue to see benefits from previously funded restructuring and our ongoing productivity initiatives but those savings were offset by unfavorable sales mix in the quarter. We had higher sales of lower margin products in smart energy and environmental and energy solutions and lower volumes in security and fire. ","In Smart Energy we're conducting aggressive value for cost, value engineering efforts and at reducing manufacturing cost. But our results from those projects have not materialized as quickly as we anticipated. We also saw margin pressure from a regional perspective as we had plus 20% growth in China and over 40% in some of the HBT businesses in China. But we saw weaker sales growth in other more profitable regions. ","Clearly not the complete result we desire in HBT but we're encouraged by the sales momentum and we're taking actions to address the profit performance including better material productivity and stronger commercial execution. ","Performance, materials and technologies had another very strong quarter with organic sales up 6%, the guide was 3% to 5% and 200 basis points of margin expansion the guide was 170 to 200 basis points. ","There was encouraging news throughout the PMT business, overall UOP sales were up single digits, mid-single digits, orders were up 40% and the backlog is up double digits. There was continued strength in UOP Russell specifically in the modular gas processing applications with six new units booked this quarter. ","We booked Russell units so far, this year and more than double the amount booked in the first half of 2016. The orders in other segments of UOP support a continued ramp up in organic sales volumes in the third quarter. ","In HPS, sales were down slightly but margins expanded significantly due to commercial excellence and productivity. We saw lower backlog conversion in projects business and lower demand for process, measurement and control products in Europe. This was partially offset by significant growth in the short cycle software and service businesses. HPS orders were up about 15% and the backlog is growing nicely.","Advanced materials had another quarter of double-digit growth and margin expansion enabled by CapEx investments we made for our Solstice line of low global warming products. ","In May we started up our largest Solstice facility and the world\u2019s largest automotive refrigerant plant, in Louisiana, which is meeting continue demand for our Solstice YF products. Sales in our Solstice business nearly doubled in the quarter.","Margin expansion came in at the high end of our guidance range driven by productivity net of inflation, results from our commercial excellence efforts and the divestiture of the former resins and chemicals business in third quarter of 2016.","We\u2019ll lap this impact in the fourth quarter and as I mentioned, margin performance was particularly strong in HPS and the advanced materials business. ","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, organic sales were up 1%, safety grew 2% on an organic basis driven by our high risk personal protection equipment and gas detection offerings.","The general safety business has been improving sequentially for the past several quarters and also return to positive organic growth in the second quarter thanks to sale and marketing initiatives as well as investments in our sales force.","Workflow solutions also grew high single digit in the quarter driven by high demand for our leading Voice Enabled Solutions and double-digit growth in the mobilizer software business driven by large win in Europe.","In sensing IoT, demand for sensing controls remain robust particularly in high growth regions. Intelligrated continues to deliver impressive results driving more than 30% this quarter, compared to the second quarter of 2016 when it was not yet owned by Honeywell and this was driven by large project awards with key accounts. ","We continue to see strong orders and backlog growth in Intelligrated, which as a reminder will begin to be countered in Honeywell\u2019s organic sales growth rates at the beginning of September.","Productivity products was down in the quarter driven by decreased North American sales particularly for the mobility business. Although we anticipated the productivity products will improve in Q3 and Q4, our more aggressive product launches will occur in the fourth quarter and will likely continue to see softness in the mobility business until early 2018.","STS segment margins while below our expectations, were still strong expanding 90 basis points excluding the first-year dilutive impact from M&A. This was primarily driven by continued productivity and restructuring benefits and was partially offset by investments in our commercial excellence as well as lower volumes in the mobility business. This shortfall for our expectations was primarily driven by lower than expected volumes in productivity products, accelerated investments related to the go-to-market strategy shift for the retail business as well as the new product launch investments I mentioned.","Slide 6, is a walk of our earnings per share from second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017. In the second quarter of last year earnings from our 2016 divestitures were approximately $0.05 per share and we exclude those amounts from our 2016 baseline, consistent with our guidance framework.","For comparison purposes, we have also normalized the tax rate for the second quarter 2016 to the 25% effective tax rate we initially assumed in our \u201817 guidance the impact of which was minor. ","Segment profit improvement resulted in $0.11 increase in earnings per share and all of our segments are contributing to the growth. Other below the line items principally lower interest expense as a result of the debt re-financings we did in 2016 as well as higher pension income accounted for $0.05 improvement to earnings per share bringing it to the $1.80 right at the high end of our guidance and up 10% year-over-year. ","As I mentioned earlier, our second quarter tax rate was lower than anticipated at 21.3%, principally the result of higher than anticipated stock option exercises which resulted in $0.09 earnings per share benefit. Conversely, the additional restructuring provisions that Darius and I mentioned reduced earnings per share by similar $0.09. On average, the payback of these projects is under two years and overall, they'll generate more than $150 million in run-rate cost savings. ","The pipeline of funded but unexecuted restructuring projects is robust at more than $300 million and will continue to drive returns as the projects are executed. ","Let's turn to slide 7, to discuss our expectations for the third quarter. In aerospace, reported sales are expected to be down 2% to 4% primarily due to the impact of the 2016 divestiture of the government service business and organic sales are expected to be flat to up 2%. ","Within commercial OE, we expect strong air transport deliveries for new platforms, partially offset by the impact of declining shipments on legacy platforms. We anticipate a tailwind from customer incentives which will improve our sales and segment margin in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned, we do not expect the recovery in to business jet OE market until closure to the late 2018 or 2019 timeframe, but we do anticipate modest growth in the business aviation aftermarket on continued R&O activity. ","We also expect continued strength in the air transport aftermarket driven by retrofits, modifications and upgrades, as well as by the typical seasonal demand. The commercial vehicle market should continue to recover, driving modest growth in transportation systems. ","Growth in light vehicle gas continue to be driven by demand in high growth regions. Aerospace margin should expand significantly this quarter driven by the OEM incentive tailwind, improving volumes and the continued benefit from prior year restructuring projects. ","In HPT, we anticipate organic sales of 1% to 3% and reported sales growth to be slightly lower so flat to up 2% due to the impacts of foreign currency translation. ","In the second quarter, there was gradual month-over-month sales growth improvement with good momentum exiting the quarter and we expect those strong trends to continue. ","Within the products business, we'll have additional large smart meter program rollouts principally in Europe and anticipate continued demand for air and water products in China. ","In distribution, the strong orders and backlog trends in building solutions combined with the commercial excellent initiatives and growing scale of our global distribution business will continue to contribute to growth. ","HPT segment margins are expected to expand 10 to 40 basis points driven by cost reductions from prior restructuring actions, ongoing commercial excellence and productivity initiatives. These will be partially offset by the continuation of the headwinds from the unfavorable product mix I mentioned earlier. ","In performance materials and technologies, sales are expected to be down 6% to 8% on a reported basis primarily due to the impact of the 2016 spin off of resins and chemicals business. But on an organic basis, we expect PMT to grow at 7% to 9% driven by conversion to sales of our strong backlog. ","UOP is expected to deliver more than 20% growth driven by strong licensing sales, continued strength in the modular gas processing business and demand for hydro processing catalyst. We expect strong growth across the entire HPS portfolio but primarily in our life cycle solutions and services, deal products and combustion businesses. In advance materials, we expect mid-single digit growth fueled principally by softness [ph]. ","PMT segment margins are expected to expand 130 to 170 basis points driven by commercial excellence, productivity and the favorable impact of the resident and chemicals divestiture. ","In safety and productivity solutions, sales are expected to be up 2% to 4% on an organic basis with reported sales increasing about 20% to the impact of sales from the Intelligrated acquisition. The fourth quarter is the first full quarter of Intelligrated organic sales. ","In the safety business, we expect further recovery in general safety products and a gradual improvement in the retail channel as our go to market transitioned from a distribution model to a direct sales model is executed. ","Growth in productivity will be driven by a robust order pipeline in the workflow solutions and continued strong demand for sensing controls. SPS margins are expected to expand by more than 150 basis points excluding the first-year dilutive impacts of M&A. This is driven primarily by benefit from last year restructuring projects, the higher volumes as well as the results from our ongoing productivity efforts. So, the for the company in total organic sales growth is anticipated to be 2% to 4% with 120 to 160 basis points of margin expansion leading to earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.75 that\u2019s up 13% to 16% year-over-year again that excludes divestitures and its normalize to the third quarter tax rate of 26%. To the extent our tax rate is lower than 26% like we did in second quarter; we intend to undertake additional restructuring projects. ","Let's move to Slide 8, as we previously mentioned we're raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.10, so the new range is $7 to $7.10 that\u2019s up 8% to 10% and again that excludes the divestitures and last year's debt refinancing charges. We're raising our full year sales guidance to $39.3 billion to $40 billion. Sales are now expected to be up 2% to 4% organic driven by higher volumes. In terms of our segments, PMT organic sales growth guidance is now 5% to 7% for the full year. SPS reported sales growth guidance is now 18% to 20% and the low end of aerospace's sales outlook is up slightly since the last quarter. ","From a segment margin expansion perspective, we remain within the initial guidance range of 70 to 110 basis points. We have lowered the full year margin guidance to both HPT and SPS and increased the margin guide for aero. In SPS we still expect strong operational margin performance consistent with our previous guidance. Overall there will be puts and takes across the businesses but we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver our full year margin expansion guidance and we remain focus on executing for the remainder of 2017. There is no change to our full year free cash flow guidance, the first half free cash flow performance was good, showing a 39% performance year-over-year and we're focused on continuous improvements in our execution across the organization. ","Let me turn to Slide 9 for a quick wrap up, we had a strong second quarter with higher than anticipated organic growth, continued margin expansion and good performance in all segments. The trends we've seen in the first half of the year are expected to continue leading to third quarter earnings per share that are expected to be up healthy double-digits. ","The entire organization is focused on executing various key priorities, which as you will recall include improving organic sales growth, maintaining our productivity rigor, becoming a best-in-class software industrial company and continuing to aggressively deploy capital all the while continues to make significant investments in Honeywell\u2019s future.","With that, let\u2019s move Mark to the Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Tom. Both Darius and Tom are available to answer your questions. Cathy, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","So just a question on the ACS related businesses, in HBT obviously the margins had been a little bit weak there and even in the HPS business, Darius can you talk maybe about the volume of kind of investments you guys are putting to work there. I mean any kind of color on -- is this -- I know investments usually are not discretionary per se given competitive pressures out there, but maybe some degree of magnitude around you know what your -- what kind of money you\u2019re putting to work there, I think that\u2019s first question. I have a quick follow-up.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, I think, clearly we are investing both in R&D [ph] and really reallocating our salesforce as well, because frankly, we\u2019ve had some places where fundamentally we under invest and I think as a matter of fact I would say in our developed markets we under invest in terms of sales force and in HGR although we've had very aggressive investments, we also want to make sure that those investments are paying off and they are, because by the way as I look at what happened in HBT in Q2, part of the issue here is the mix and just to give you a couple of facts, our China, EVNS business was up 45% in Q2 and that\u2019s a little bit part of our margin mix challenge that we had here in the quarter, but overall continue to be very bullish. The other thing is that we are working on this what I call kind of second tier value offerings for ENS and HSF as well as investing in our DIY platforms that\u2019s how characterize most of investments.","Steve Tusa","Is there a degree of kind of margin pressure that\u2019s happening today that can kind of spin back into the numbers as growth come through? Is that kind of like of a step up or just anyway to somewhat quantify that?","Darius Adamczyk","I mean think you know obviously [indiscernible]. I think that some of it is a mix and some of it\u2019s we got to do a little bit better on couple of elements. You know the two places I found too is I think we have an opportunity to drive material products really. I have higher expectations there and the second one is around prices and commercial excellence, because I think frankly some of those areas that we haven\u2019t done as well as we could have. Having said that, I think overall, it\u2019s a pretty positive story, because as you look at our markets, we grew faster than our markets particularly on the residential side. So all-in-all, yeah, I\u2019m slightly disappointing by the margin rate but we have some actions that Terence and his team are working and I don\u2019t want to also forget about our 4% top line growth with tremendous growth in China just well north of 20% for HBT. ","Steve Tusa","And that could be an '18 story, is that improvement? '18 story?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last quick one. One last one on free cash flow, normal seasonality kind of get to you north of where you're guiding to. Is there anything that's kind of reverses in the second half that suggested it shouldn't kind of track a more normal seasonal trend for the second half Tom?","Tom Szlosek","No, I think we're fine on cash. When you draw the market at the end of the first half overall conversion is right aligned with where we were last year. But in the second half some of the initiatives that we've got going are going to drive that strong performance. Frankly, I think, we should do better than overall 5% to 7% and to your point on the first half growth. But we've got a little bit of a track record of not necessarily being entirely accurate on our cash forecast and so we want to be sufficiently conservative as we head into the second half, big effort for us.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, Steve I'll just point out that, we've had some headwinds both in the first half on cash [indiscernible] well north of $300 million and then we got some more coming in the second half. So that's why I think -- but by the way, that's how we selected on our outlook for the year, and that's why it may seem like we're being a little conservative, but we've got some real headwinds. ","Operator","Next, we'll go to Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to get back into HPC and I think the moving parts there were pretty well known. But obviously foreign securities a bit weaker versus particularly on average. So, I'm wondering do we have visibility on some improvement in that in the second half of the year. Is that more of an '18 story? ","And then the second part of that question is I think this is the first time in you've called China as a below feet average margin geography, maybe I'm wrong there, but what is the path towards getting China margins back towards feet average or better?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think as any kind of high growth age geography its slightly diluted to the overall average. And obviously when you blend it in at a 45% growth, it has an impact. ","In terms of margins, we think we're with those pretty aggressively appearances all over this both on the productivity side as well as the commercial excellence as we have some opportunity with some new products coming. So, I expect some level of recovery and we are going to grow margins in that business this year. We're probably a little bit aggressive initially and that's why we had some puts and takes in the overall Honeywell portfolio. That happened to be one of the takes. But we expect growth there, the margin growth for 2017 and further enhancements for 2018. And I can also tell you that, a good portion of the structuring funds that we allocated in Q2 went to HPC. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's helpful. And then a question for Tom on the hedging and given the weakness in the dollar we have seen continuing through 3Q. So, the way I understand, it's helpful to topline, it's harmful to EBIT so there is a bit of margin pressure. So just looking at your unchanged segment guidance for the year, I'm wondering if volumes on margin has been offset by another threshold FX or may be some material but maybe you can just clean that up, and then where do you stand on hedging for '18.","Tom Szlosek","So just for 2017, Nigel it will be more or less about three quarters are more locked in on FX rates and as you know our hedging program is intended when you consider all the aspects of it, the net result is to hedge the operating income and not necessarily the topline, definitely not the topline. So, our top line will definitely flow as the FX flows and so, if you see the euro strengthening as you have over the last few weeks, our topline should improve. However, our margin rates, our margin dollars are more or less locked in from also the major currencies as for the year given the hedging that we did at the beginning of the year. So, if you start to see a strengthening or weakening second half that\u2019s not going to have a material impact on our margin rates themselves given that we've had to lock the rates in. So, 2018 we're taking a similar approach, we don\u2019t necessarily disclose all the positions but we're keeping a strong eye on the currencies where we have major exposures euro of being a big one and taking risk off the table as we see the opportunities arise. ","Operator","We will now take a question from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. ","Jeffrey Sprague ","Couple of questions, first on Intelligrated and the growth that you're seeing there, would this all still be associated with what they had in the pipeline and the order book at the time of the deal or is there some kind of Honeywell benefit that\u2019s starting to show up in your results, that\u2019s the first question. ","Darius Adamczyk","The answer to your question is no, this was not there at the time of the deal, the pipeline is grown substantially and certainly there is an inherent Honeywell benefit, I mean frankly the Honeywell brand is really well known throughout of the industrial and logistics world and its benefited from the current relationships that we've had and as you recall the premise behind this business going into SPS is our scanning and mobility business its strongest vertical is transportation logistics. So, there is a lot of benefit in terms of cross selling and leveraging that sales force to generate leads for Intelligrated, so we're certainly seeing the benefits from that and that pipeline Intelligrated is extraordinarily robust. ","Jeffrey Sprague ","Right and then just on speaking about PNC margins and a lot going on there with you HPS, but we're just thinking about how slows this ramp. Can you give us some sense of how full utilized the new factory or factories are and kind of what kind of operating leverage we could expect flowing as you ramp up post this year?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, the new factory, the Apollo factory that Tom referred to, it's not fully utilized yet, that just came online, it started up in May. So, I think about 50% like utilization which is kind of normal at this stage because it's still ramping up. There is more leverage there to come and we\u2019re going to be shifting our supply a bit from an externally sourced and so on to more internally produced obviously that\u2019s been accretive which is good news. So, the short story here is that there is more leverage to comment. As you saw Jeff really, really nice story in TMT, I mean it\u2019s both in terms of orders, leverage under revenue and Solstice continues to deliver. And strong backlog too, I mean we had a nice backlog, we had in the second half of the year in all the businesses.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Right. And just one another quick one, Tom, can you just put a finer point on what the variances Q3 versus Q3 and the aero incentives either in dollars or margin?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, it\u2019s about I say 50 basis points margin impact year-over-year and as you know that the 2000 overall incentives for the year are going to be probably 40 to 60 basis points down on most of that coming in second half and most of that being in the third quarter. So, this is where you will see the biggest impact and that\u2019s why those aerospace margin rates for the third quarter will be so robust. I mean they\u2019re already robust without the incentives. I mean but up to 300 plus of improvement is pretty strong. I think the other [indiscernible].","Operator","Right now, we\u2019ll go to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So, hey Tom may be following up on that point right there on the OEM incentives, it\u2019s interesting, when you take a look at your organic growth guidance for 3Q in aero, the surprise, that it wasn\u2019t a little bit higher because you do have the benefit from OEM and you have a pretty easy comp. So, is there any what -- what\u2019s kind of offsetting that in 3Q or is it just kind of like a conservatives 3Q guide?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I think we want to build up some momentum here, we had a strong commercial aftermarket 5% in the second quarter and we kind of want to see that momentum continued. I mean that, that we sort of factored in low single digits for third quarter, I think the defense in space we got a comparable quarter-over-quarter. The incentives do come through and if they do -- I mean that they will come through, if the aftermarket comes through like it did in the second quarter we should be definitely at the high end of that 2% organic if not pushing higher.","Darius Adamczyk","Joe, I would like to just add, I think the mix is such that we kind of know the visibility on [Indiscernible] we know what that looks like and so when we are actually getting much more into the shorter cycle business for aftermarket especially on the VGA side. So frankly we don\u2019t have as much visibility as we normally in aerospace, because that\u2019s what we are counting and as Tom pointed out we want to kind of see that rate of aftermarket activity both on the ATR and DJ side maintain, let the guidance be where it is. ","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Okay. And then maybe just on up on Steve\u2019s question from just a little earlier, but asking it slightly differently. I guess if you think about all the restructuring actions that you guys have taken the pull forward in 3Q last year, it is now restructuring this year in 2Q. It\u2019s nice to see the growth uptick, but I guess maybe if you could just kind of comment on what you're seeing competitively in your ability to hold the cost benefits into your margins and how much you're actually having to utilize to actually offset potentially a competitive pricing environment. I think any color around that would be helpful.","Darius Adamczyk","Sure. I mean it's a couple of points. The first one is, we definitely are seeing the benefits of restructuring come through. And that's certainly there. I think might be your questions talk more on HPC and yeah, it is a competitive environment. However, we also have a very strong competitive context position there. And we're seeing that in our growth rates in particularly in high growth regions but also in the end. ","So, part of its mixed, but part of it is we got an opportunity to do a little bit better, like I said on a mature productivity side, commercial excellence and so on as well as some new product launches that we're doing and kind of offering having the Honeywell premiums here as well as the values here, as well as expansion DIY. So, there is some now help things that we're embarking upon and were started in Q2 and I expect to see some benefit of that towards the end of this year and even more so next year. So yeah, it's a competitive environment, but given our brand, product positioning, overall value to customers, I'm bullish and how we're going to perform here. ","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","And now we will go to Peter [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Tom, you mentioned briefly on PNP on the backlog. Do you ex kind sold this, how is backlog holding up or what kind of visibility do you have? Can you give us little more color there?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, it's really strong. When you look at both HPS as well as UOP, I mean they are both north of 10% -- I'm sorry, in total they're north of 10%, UOP is pushing 20%, HPS as I said strong momentum. And we think that\u2019s going to continue. When you look at the character what's in UOP, its particularly encouraging because you see it across all of their product lines which means that it's not just an aftermarket where getting catalyst sales, but we're getting the full gamut of things. The engineering, the new projects, the equipment. And that means that there is more investing going on than we had seen over the course of last year. So, the good prospects and good character comprehensive character backlog across the UOP businesses. ","And HPS, same thing. I mean even more skewed towards the higher profit service side for HPS. I mean that\u2019s pushing 10% up, and then one reason the HPS backlog isn't where UOP one is, in terms of double digits is that we've been carrying and we've been very successful in some of these megaprojects in HPS. And as you execute those and they came out of the backlog obviously you see the impact. Those projects carry a lot of third-party content however. They're not necessarily the most profitable. But they do an installed base and we find them overall to be very attractive long-term. So, when I look at HPS backlog even though it's mid-single digits growth, the character of it from a profitability perspective is quite different than that you would thought a year ago, or you would have seen it a year ago. ","Darius Adamczyk","If I could just add even more color because we're very pleased with what we're seeing there, if you think about backlog for all of the PMT up double digit, think about order rates for PMT for Q2 up north of 20%. And the best part Q3 outlook, high single digit outlook for order rate. So, we\u2019re really, really pleased how that business is performing and this is going to get maintain and that time momentum is out there for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, and just a quick unrelated follow up, on the [indiscernible] weakness, Tom it just sounds like it's been a lingering issue for a long time but it sounds like things have gotten worse on the OE side? Any color there would be appreciated. ","Tom Szlosek","No, I mean, when you look to go back 18 months or couple of years, you're seeing heavy double-digit declines on the DGA OE, remember in the fourth quarter we're --second half we\u2019re down over 30% on the OE side. Those declines have moderated, was mid-single digit decline in the second quarter for the BGA OE business and we kind to expected to moderate around that. I mean the orders can be a little bit lumpy and the timing doesn\u2019t necessary correlate to what our customers would report for their shipments. But I'm not going to say we've seen the bottom but the rates have declined are significantly less than what they were a year ago. ","Operator","We will now move to Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","You did make an acquisition in Q2 but acquisition activity has still been relatively quiet and you\u2019ve talked about valuations in the past being pretty high and maybe waiting for tax reform. Do you expect to have a big ramp up in M&A activity in the second half of this year and if not, do you end up buying that more stock? I mean how should we look at capital allocation in the second half of the year?","Darius Adamczyk","All right I would say that the pipeline is very active and probably has three to five things we're looking at very, very seriously. But, we're going to continue to be cautious buyers and I think part of it is just the discipline around purchase price, there is certainly things out there that we're very interested in but sales have to come at the right price. So hopefully, I cannot guarantee what will happen, but hopefully will have some additions to the portfolio in the second half, we certainly have some interesting properties that we\u2019re closely examining. But it also has to happen at the right price, so we will see what happens and we're not -- I think the tax environment regime, I think there is more uncertainty in that now than may be even before, so I can't let that sort of rule the business and I'm not going to hold that up, I've indicated before we have a slight reference for overseas M&A, versus domestic, but certainly we'll look at anything. So, we'll see what happens. ","And then in terms of share buyback as I indicated depending upon what happens on the M&A front and we\u2019re going to be looking to add as a lever as well. But I'm not sure we really exhaust those possibilities first and I'm still hoping we will have a little more clarity on the tax front, maybe even before the end of this quarter. ","Tom Szlosek","And Andy just to add for a little bit of dollar on that, you remember Gary has said at the Investor Day that from a capital allocation perspective, U.S. we would look to deploy $5 billion this year, between dividends, share buybacks, and M&A. The dividend is more or less understood to be about 2 out of that 5, that means $3 billion between share buybacks and M&A. So far, we done about $1 billion of share buyback and so we\u2019ve got a couple of billion less and Gary says we are going to watch that. So, that\u2019s the $5 billion in the U.S. outside the U.S. and as we said at a time there is close to $10 billion of capacity is ready to be put to use immediately, let alone excluding even the leveraging capability. So, I think we are on track on both fronts but I don\u2019t think there is an impending rush of deal that you are going to see after we get off this call. So, we\u2019ll keep you guys in the loop.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","All right. Thanks for that, guys. I mean there is commentary around your productivity products business suggest that and maybe your new product rollouts there have been maybe slower than you thought or at least not quite as effective. Can you talk about your confidence level on turning around that business as you turn the portfolio here? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think the one thing that\u2019s important as you think about SPS, I think it's important to put in context where the issue is, the issue is in one business and one segment of the business called mobility and it\u2019s even more regional than that which is called North America. As I pointed out, the issue on the last call which is you know sort of our array of products in the Android, at the Android operating system, frankly we\u2019re not, where we need to be in terms of our range and offering. We did launch a good product in Q2 which will help I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the full solution. The team has very robust launch plans, but frankly those won\u2019t happen until about Q4 of this year. So, we\u2019re expecting some improvement in the second half but really full improvement will really happen in 2018 as all those products come to the market. Although, I will say, we are encouraged by the product launch that they did in May, we don\u2019t really have a lot of that revenue yet generated from those offerings.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And now we will go to Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, good to see a little bit of green on my screen today. Just a follow up question on China, is the mix in China changing, because historically my understanding is that China was more profitable, but you have been talking about a big push in consumer area in China. Is that something that is impacting margin?","Darius Adamczyk","China is still very attractive and very profitable. The product segments that happen to do especially in HPT this quarter was sort of a mix which is -- we mentioned slightly delimited with the overall HPT rate. But overall, we are very, very pleased with the China profitability and overall on a Honeywell basis, it compares to our overall margins and where we are seeing the kind of growth we are seeing, that\u2019s a great thing for us and we are very bullish there and I think, if I could point to a market that I was extraordinarily pleased with in Q2, that would be it, our China growth was spectacular. ","Tom Szlosek","Yeah just to accentuate that a little bit, the GDP -- whatever the right GDP is for China say its 7%, I mean every one of our business was well north of that. Aerospace is doing fantastic on the [indiscernible] side, TS has got new launches taking advantage of the quality opportunity with their HPT and a lot of new products particularly air and water up double digit, safety and productivity up double digit, and PMT up double digit, I mean you'll see HPS in fact all of them were just outstanding in China. We get more momentum there, and we leverage the capacity and we have from a production perspective the profitability continues to grow. And it's already very healthy. ","Andrew Obin","And China and his team have always had a very and I think Honeywell have always have a very sophisticated view of China. We're getting a lot of questions from investors about Chinese growth after this big party congress they're going to have in October, November. What are your guys sort of framework for growth in the first half of 2018? Some people tell us growth will slow down, some people tell us they'll try to save face and so the new team will see good growth as well. What are your insights?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah obviously it's very important for the Chinese economy to do pretty well until that November timeframe. But overall, we continue to be bullish on China. I think whether this pace is maintained or something slightly lower than that, I don't think that changes our calculus as it relates to China because we expect growth there to be both five times what it is in some of our DM markets. And we're showing those kinds of numbers. ","And by the way, as Tom talked double digits, its not10%, I think as a number that's well 2X times that number. So, we have the right momentum, we have the right presence, we're very comfortable with our strategies in terms of what we're doing [indiscernible]. and I still think it's maybe early innings for us in terms of building out our China business and actually using it more as a hub for a lot of the other economies. So, I continue to be optimistic whether it's going to get better or slightly worse. The business changed our investment profile and our bullishness overall on the market. ","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just a first question around the transport piece within aerospace. The growth there was around 1% or 2% in the first half. I think just in commercial vehicles recovering a bit, but the automotive side maybe softening. So maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in automotive specifically, how you think that plays out in the second half. And how you're thinking more broadly about the growth outlook for transport?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. Have to about automotive. Again, automotive grew, that business grew for us this past quarter. It was bit of an interesting mix, diesel was down and was down high single digits, but more than offset by growth in gasoline, growth in commercial vehicles and high growth regions really, really pick off. I talked about China again, but again a great story, you talk about double digit growth in China. We grew over 40% there, in Q2. So, a really nice growth rate and we're really well positioned globally, so even though some of our markets in U.S. and Europe were down slightly they were more than offset by our presence and our growth in HGR, so really nice positioning of that business and we continue to be very, very bullish on its outlook. Even a country like Brazil grew well double digit, so nice story. ","Tom Szlosek","The other thing I would add to that, Julian is the -- some of this is just timing related as we complete platforms or our customer are OE customers, discontinued platforms that we're on, that can have a short-term impact on rates and we've seen a couple of platforms that come to completion in the second quarter but as you know our win rates, our new platforms for the business has been in an all-time high, I mean we think we're pushing 50% of the win rate on new platform. So that will start to come through as well, so I wouldn\u2019t read into the 1% as indication of any challenge, we're in pretty good shape on transportation. ","Julian Mitchell","Understood thank you, and then my second quarter was really beyond SPS and sort of the platform outlook there within warehouse automation and logistics specifically. You had Intelligrated now within the portfolio of the nine months or so. You think you're in a position now having integrated it well today to further M&A in that warehouse arena or you are pretty satisfied with the market share and the offering you have right now. ","Darius Adamczyk","We certainly like the space, if there is the right acquisition there, we have we certainly look at it, it's an interesting market for us, we do have a strong presence between our scanning and mobility business, between Intelligrated, even our industrial safety and safety gears as that we sell into that market although together and create a very coherent and valuable proposition for our customers. But certainly, look at some other segments, there is something of interest there, so we will see what happens. ","Tom Szlosek","I think the warehouse automation space is going to be really nice one for us to continue to invest. And you got the building blocks but there are lot of both agencies geographically as well as software wise that really, we can enhance the model with. So, we're excited by what we're seeing. ","Operator","We will now take a question from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. ","John Inch ","Is there a way to qualify and may be quantify possibly the impact of sort of relatively stable crude prices here, do you guys have a decent amount of direct and indirect exposures and I'm just curious if, how Tom and Darius you would think about that or articulate that?","Darius Adamczyk","There is a lot of directional movement, one-minute U.S. inventory was down and you know today not such good news there is talk about Saudi holding back production, every day there seems to be sort of a different data point which has an impact on oil prices. But you know the punch line for us is that, something north of 40 and if we get some stability like we've had then things are fine, if price of oil drops below 40 and stays there for a bit that would concern me. You know we\u2019ll see what happens, there\u2019s is a lot of moving pieces between continued expansion of the U.S. shale production, between what OPAC is going to do with, what\u2019s Libya and Nigeria, what are they producing, what\u2019s Iran going to do. So, there is a lot of moving pieces here, it\u2019s hard to say for exactly what decisions are going to be made. I think this next OPAC is going to be very, very important one, in which case we can set some directionality. ","But overall as of right now and as you can see from our order rates for both HPS and UOP, the market is good and the activity is very good, very good second quarter and we are bullish on the third quarter as well. ","Tom Szlosek","I think those portfolios have proven to be fairly resistant to massive movement in the oil prices. And what I mean by that is, if you look at what the nature of where we participate, I mean we are in the midstream and downstream, all of exclusively in the downstream for UOP so refining and petrochemicals. I mean those are areas that stood up very well, in the when oil was down at all-time low. HPS a little bit more midstream, but still I think the positioning of our portfolio makes them fairly resistant, I mean not immune, not trying to put that out there, but [indiscernible].","John Inch ","Yeas, and Tom you went through them when oil was crashing right, you went through a fairly elaborate exercise to sort of basically pitch for the resilience of portfolio, I\u2019m just trying to understand we had semi-reasonably stable oil prices and we\u2019re seeing some sort of net tailwind that maybe if oil stays here anniversaries next year so the benefit you\u2019re getting this year maybe dissipates a little next year. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just trying to put this into a context, that\u2019s all?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, I mean I would see that where the markets comeback this year, it\u2019s unquestionable, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s come back in a big kind of fashion, I would say the HPS and UOP teams are just doing very, very well in terms of their performance. I mean the kind of booking rates that they\u2019re getting and we\u2019re seeing, I haven\u2019t seen for anybody else, so I am very pleased with how they're performing but I definitely think that provided the oil price stay stable or maybe upticks there could be a bit more tailwinds here to come. So, I\u2019m optimistic and the pipeline that we have in terms of our [indiscernible] makes me optimistic. Now that could change, but right now, I\u2019m fairly bullish on the market.","John Inch ","Yes, makes sense. So, then just as a follow-up Darius the portfolio review, are we still, no one has asked about it, you didn\u2019t really talk about in your prepared remarks. Are on track for some sort of a presentation announcement, I think you said by this summer, and I just want to clarify, it's not going to be in the last week of August is it, I mean by summer do you mean, when you get back from Labor Day?","Darius Adamczyk","I just want to make sure everybody is on holiday. We are still targeting what I said was late summer, early fall, we are very much tracking to that and that\u2019s what I anticipate to have some further clarity here on the portfolio.","John Inch ","Right, so don\u2019t change the date and time just yet. ","Darius Adamczyk","No, I think it stays the last week of August. Relax, the beach is nice. ","Operator","And for one final question that will from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. ","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you. Many of my questions have been answered. But I did want to ask at Paris Air Show and over the last couple of quarters, Boeing has talked a lot about penetrating the service business and they cited avionics as one of the areas that they're trying to get more share of in the aftermarket. And I just wanted to get your opinion on what form do you think this take, so this is more of an opportunity or is it a risk for Honeywell longer term? And how do you guys approach this potential change in the marketplace?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah. I'm not really sure yet, because we haven't seen some of those planes, yet we're allowed by Boeing. Boeing is a very well respected within the Honeywell as a customer, partner of Boeing, a number of things, they're great customer and we're going to do whatever we need to do to support them as a customer. In terms of exactly what's going to happen and how they're going to be going after their services business I think that's yet to be find out. So, to me there isn\u2019t that clear whether it's an opportunity or a threat. I will tell you that our connected aircraft which I think is something about [ph] to Boeing and a lot of the other OEMs. It's something that's picking up pace very, very quickly. I talked about the connected ATU in my opening and that's giving tremendous traction of customers. And by the way that's only the beginning in terms of our offerings for connected aircraft. We have many, many more coming. So, I think that that's complementary towards Boeing -- and some of the OEMs. So overall, I'm very positive on our continued strong relationship with Boeing going forward. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's Question-and-Answer Session. At this time, we like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional or closing comments. ","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. The second quarter was another strong one for us with strong organic growth, margin expansion and continued free cash flow momentum which is up nearly 40% on a year-over-year basis. And we're able to undertake some sizable restructuring projects that will benefit our future performance. It was not a perfect quarter and we have several opportunities that are well within our control to improve. There is a lot more upside for Honeywell and we'll continue our focus on improving organic growth, maintaining our productivity vigor, becoming a best-in-class software industrial company and aggressively deploying capital. We also remain committed to investing in our future and we're looking forward to sharing more great results in October.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elena Doom","Good morning. Thank you, Jack. Welcome to Honeywell\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. Today\u2019s call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of today\u2019s presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. These elements can change, and we\u2019d ask that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our business performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we\u2019ll review our financial results for the second quarter, and share with you our outlook for the third quarter and full-year, and of course leave time for your questions.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen by now Honeywell had a good second quarter capping off a strong first half, which puts us well on our way to achieving the full-year guidance that we set back in December.","Normalizing for tax, EPS was $1.22, up 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and in line with our guidance of a $1.18 to $1.23. Sales of $9.7 billion were near the high-end of guidance and if you exclude defense where the headwinds are well known and as we expected them. We saw our sales growth in each of the four businesses.","We also continue to benefit from margin expansion, up 30 basis points to 16.1%. Part of the driver here has been the savings from the proactive repositioning actions we have taken in prior period. As we continue to face an uncertain macro outlook, we think it's prudent to keep that pipeline full. So we funded over $60 million of incremental restructuring this quarter, more than offsetting an OPEB curtailment gain and bringing us to approximately $100 million of repositioning actions funded this year.","Dave is going to take you into more detail on that later. However, while investing for productivity is important, it sure is a lot easier to expand margins when sales are growing. So even in this tough environment, we\u2019re planting the seeds that will drive future topline growth. Some of the lowest the risk, highest return projects available to us are organic. So we continue to invest in R&D, new product introductions and capacity expansion.","Our long-cycle businesses, including Commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP, continue to benefit from a strong backlog, which ended the quarter roughly $15.5 billion. The businesses are also winning in the marketplace. And some examples in Aerospace, we now \u2013 it\u2019s the newest version of our HTF7000 series engine, the HTF7350 will power the new Challenger 350 super midsize business jet.","As we have said before, we think the super midsized and longer range segments represented an attractive space for growth and we\u2019re excited about this most recent win. Additionally, if you were at the Paris Air Show, you may have noticed an awful lot of excitement around an A320 sprinting along the tarmac. This was a demonstration of our electric green taxiing system or EGTS, developed in partnership with Safran, which uses the APU rather than the main engines to taxi during preflight operations.","This can provide operators up to $200,000 a year in fuel savings per aircraft. We also had another important win with Airbus. Though not from the from the business you were probably expecting. Honeywell Building Solutions was awarded a $37 million project to build, operate and maintain a power facility for airbuses new assembly line here in the U.S. The project which will be done to LEED certification standard is a great example of one Honeywell cross-selling between businesses to the benefit of both Honeywell and our customers.","And finally, because there are a lot to choose from, I\u2019d like to highlight one UOP win. Our Oleflex technology which converse propane into propylene was selected again this time by Ascend Performance Materials Operations, the world\u2019s largest on-purpose propylene production facility. As you\u2019ve heard I\u2019ve said before petrochemical makers are installing additional capacity to meet growing demand and to make up for the shortage of propylene production from traditional sources.","Once again, order rates were mixed in the quarter, with the U.S. stable, Europe trending slightly positive in both short and long cycle and a notable turnaround in China from the first quarter with sales up mid teens. The inflexion point of China recurred in June with broad based performance improvement in all businesses. ACF short and long cycle businesses along with stellar growth in UOP, added to a much stronger performance in China than Q1 in last year, while transportation systems continued its growth momentum from Q1.","We also continue to progress with our key process initiatives. The Honeywell operating system, functional transformation and velocity product development, that focus on making sure that the machinery works for our employees to get their jobs done effectively and efficiently everyday makes us better at delivering both growth and productivity. With these things in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2013 outlook. First half EPS was 238, when normalizing for tax, which based in our historical linearity is trending towards the top half of the 475 to 495 guidance range we gave you back in December, despite continued soft end market conditions.","As a result of this continued strong execution, we raised the low end of our guidance by a nickel in the first quarter and we\u2019re doing it again this quarter, giving us a new EPS guidance range of 485 to 495 or up 8% to 11% for the year. We just concluded our strategic planning reviews with each of the four businesses and while we\u2019re preparing for near-term underlying macro conditions to be much the same, what was particularly impressive with each businesses innovation pipeline and growth opportunities.","We are looking forward to sharing this and more with you early next year when we publish our new five-year plan. But you can expect our continued evolution in everything to drive outperformance over this timeframe.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to talk you through more on the detail. Dave?","David J. Anderson","Thanks. Good morning and welcome and appreciate your participation this morning. Let\u2019s start with slide number 4 and let me walk you through the summary financial results for the second quarter. Sales of $9.7 billion were up approximately 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, near the high-end of our guidance range and up 1% on an organic basis. The Americas were roughly flat, really driven by lower defense and space sales, while Europe, as Dave said, was good overall, up 1% and China was up 14% driven by improvement in our short cycle businesses, mainly at ESS, the Energy, Safety and Security business of ECS and also transportation systems. In addition, we had continued good long cycle growth in China.","Segment profit for the quarter was up 4% with segment margins expanding 30 basis points to 16.1%. Now it's important to note we had margin expansion of 60 basis points or more in every business other than PMT. And you'll recall from our guidance that we gave for the quarter that PMT's margin rate was unfavorably impacted by a number of items but most notably the low UOP licensing activity this year compared to the record levels that we had in the second quarter of 2012. So again, PMT's margin decrease is largely explained by that. And important to point out that the absolute level of PMT margins in the second quarter was 19%, very impressive. We need to keep that in mind.","Below the line items were mostly as anticipated and importantly we recognized an OPEB curtailment gain of 42 million which was more than offset by more than 60 million of restructuring actions which we're going to discuss in more detail in a moment, and obviously that's another highlight for the quarter.","Moving to EPS, similar to the first quarter, we had a tax rate in the second quarter that was favorable relative to our guidance both for the quarter of 26.5% and our full-year guidance of 26.5%. So we had 23.1% effective tax rate this year in the second quarter versus 26% even in the second quarter of last year. However, while the timing of certain tax items will continue to be lumpy, we continue to expect that full-year rate of 26.5% for the year.","That means that roughly $0.11 of favorability that we've experienced in the first half, we had $0.05 in the first quarter, $0.06 in the second quarter will be offset in the second half. And importantly we've assumed that will occur in the fourth quarter for planning and guidance purposes, and I'm going to come back to that and cover that in a little more detail when we talk about the second half.","So for the second quarter, reported EPS of $1.28 up 12% versus prior year, however normalizing at the 26.5% rate both last year and this year, EPS would have been $1.22, up 8%. Finally, free cash flow was 1.1 billion, up 10% versus prior year and represents a conversion rate of approximately 112%, so very good cash quarter also.","So with that summary, let's go to slide 5, let's start with Aerospace on slide 5. For the quarter, sales were down 1% as commercial growth of 5% was more than offset by declines in Defense & Space. In the commercial side, lead sales were up 8% driven by continued strong OE build rates in large in large air transport and continued healthy demand in the mid to large cabin business aircraft segment, but we've got such a strong position.","Moving to the commercial aftermarket, sales were up 3% driven by commercial excellence, the improved flight hour growth and the continued uptake of repairs, modifications and upgrades or RMUs in the BGA segment, partially offset by fewer maintenance events.","Now if you look at utilization rates for a moment, global flying hours were up roughly 4% year-over-year compared to the first quarter which was less than 2%, so we've seen a steadily improving trend in the flight hours. Spares growth was slightly ahead of utilization rates in the quarter and would expect these improving utilization rates to support the aftermarket growth outlook, we're going to talk to you about that more in a little bit, in the second half of the year.","Defense & Space down 8% revenues with the U.S. defense sales unfavorable impacted by planned ramp-downs, project ramp-downs as well as some program delays, partially offset by growth in international markets. And again, while sequestration headwinds continue to be a challenge for the business, we still had a number of key program starts in the quarter and we continue to believe we're on track to our full-year expectations for D&S down revenues 4% for the full-year.","Turning to segment profit, the Aerospace margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.5% driven by commercial excellence, productivity net of inflation and partially offset by lower Defense & Space sales.","Let's now turn to ACS, Automation and Control on slide 6. ACS sales for the quarter were up 3%. They had growth in all three of their sub-segments and in every region. On an organic basis, sales of the U.S. were up 2% driven by improving residential and market conditions offsetting tougher industrial comparables last year. And non-res construction remains depressed although the orders pipeline does appear to be improving.","Europe was up slightly, outperforming the overall market with good growth in ESS, partially offset by building solutions as a result of soft economic conditions. In China, sales were up 6% with good growth in both the short and long cycle businesses in ACS.","Now transitioning and just going through a couple of the high points of each of the ACS sub-segment. ESS, Energy, Safety and Security, sales were up 3% globally. We had particularly good performance in ECC, in security as well as fire with organic growth in all of these pieces 5% or better as a result of new products, continued good geographic expansion and also continued evidence of the U.S. residential strength that I referenced earlier, and we'll come back later and particularly give you a little more color in terms of those segments.","Process Solutions sales were up 4% for ACS afforded by continued good services growth and the uptake in our advanced solutions software offerings. And just like the first quarter, we had strong sales conversion as a result of higher margin in the backlog. For BSD, Buildings Solutions and Distribution, sales were up 1% driven by higher sales in the Americas security distribution business and also in building services.","Moving to segment margins, ACS was up 110 basis points in the quarter to 14.4% representing over 50% sales conversion much of it reflected in higher gross margins. Commercial excellence, a number of operational improvements particularly notably in Process Solutions and strong productivity, net of inflation including the repositioning benefits that are flowing through, all of these contributed to the ACS margin performance in the quarter.","Now let's go to slide 7 and look at the highlights for PMT, Performance, Materials and Technologies. Sales for PMT were 1.7 billion, up 9% in the quarter driven by continued growth in UOP. UOP saw almost 40% top line growth, 11% on an organic basis primarily driven by the addition of Thomas Russell, increased catalyst shipment, also higher equipment sales reflecting strong petrochemical as well as gas end markets. Now the UOP backlog continues to be robust, up 10% organically with strong customer adoption of new UOP technologies and investments in new capacity.","On the other side, advanced material sales were down 6% versus prior year reflecting soft end markets overall. Flooring saw a slow start to the cooling season resulting in delayed purchases by customers, presumably that's beginning to pick up now, as well as lower production volumes from the continued Metropolis plant shutdown, which resumed operations at the site in July following approximately 12-month shutdown for structural upgrades.","Now Resins & Chemicals experienced lower production volumes year-over-year, primarily related to plant outages and also soft market conditions in China. As I said earlier, segment margins for PMT were down 360 basis points, consistent with our expectations and what we communicated to you back in April primarily driven by the impact of lower UOP licensing sales versus last year, lower advanced material volumes, growth investments that we continue to make in PMT as well as the impact inflation.","We also continued to see dilution in the margin rate for PMT and again as expected, from the Thomas Russell acquisition which we will lap in the fourth quarter. So for the full-year, we continue to expect PMT margins in the range of 18.4% to 18.6%.","Let's finish off the segment highlights by going to Transportation Systems, slide 8. So TS in the quarter, sales up 5% year-over-year, the first gain importantly since 2011 with turbo volumes up high single digits as higher turbo gas penetration in all regions strong growth from new launches and improving China commercial vehicle sales more than offset slight declines in European light vehicle production in the quarter. Now we\u2019re really encouraged by what's been a relatively stable production environment, although the possibility of a second half inventory correction still exits as new car registrations continue to be weak in Europe and we planned accordingly which we\u2019ll cover in a moment when we talk about TS in the second half outlook.","Segment margins for the business were up 60 basis points to 13.3% in the second quarter, primarily driven by strong productivity in volume leverage partially offset by unfavorable price. And just as a reminder, in June we completed the one year anniversary of the closure of the FMs or the initiation of the FMs closure of Conde, the friction material closure of Conde. We completed that this June and that facility in the foreclosure that facility will provide meaningful productivity benefits beginning in the second half and of course flowing through to 2014.","Now before we move to our third quarter expectations, I just want to take a moment to update you on the status of our restructuring pipeline because as Dave referenced earlier that\u2019s going to continue to be an important element of our continued margin expansion efforts.","So on slide 9, starting with the left hand side of the chart. What we\u2019ve done here is walk you from our restructuring balance at the end of the year to where at the end of 2012 to where we are today. And as you can see while we successfully executed a roughly $70 million of outstanding projects we funded approximately $100 million of new projects adding to the projects in process through the first six months of the year.","Now moving to the right side of the page just to help you a little bit in terms of understanding this chart; the blue bar on the right hand side of the chart reflects the cumulative repositioning funding that we\u2019ve done in 2012 as well as year-to-date 2013. So the blue bar represents over $200 million of growth repositioning over six quarters and delivering savings shown in the red bars of $130 million in 2013 and over $220 million or an incremental $90 million in 2014.","So many of our projects, we\u2019re very pleased to say have between a one to two year payback, so we\u2019re being proactive here and it's a big reason again we\u2019ve been able to continue to expand margins in this slow growth environment. Further we continue to identify and drive cost saving projects across the Company. Funding projects to realign resources and regional footprints to reflect the current global growth outlook and our market opportunities, and we\u2019re also executing against our acquisition integrations plans to drive cost synergies delivering further benefits in 2014 and obviously beyond.","So now let\u2019s go to slide 10, and let\u2019s discuss our outlook for the third quarter. For the third quarter we\u2019re expecting sales to be in the range of $9.8 billion to $10 billion up 2% to 4% on an organic basis. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 up 5% to 10% when you normalize for the tax rate of 26.5% in both years. So lets just do kind of a quick recap on kind of the revenue outlook and as well as a couple of references to margin for the third quarter by business. In Aerospace we\u2019re expecting sales to be up low single digits perhaps 1% to 3%, driven by commercial growth including mid single digit growth in the aftermarket as a result of easier comps and improved utilization rates, partially offset by mid single digit declines in defense and space.","Now we expect ACS sales to be up 2% to 4% in the third quarter on an organic basis and incremental sales growth resulting from the Intermec acquisition, which we now expect to close in the third quarter. It's also important to note that the Intermec and RAE systems acquisitions will have a dilutive impact on ACSs margin in the third quarter of approximately 100 basis points. So ACSs reported segment margin will be down slightly year-over-year likely in the range of 20 to 30 basis points a result at the acquisition headwind.","In PMT we\u2019re expecting sales to be up 13% to 16% which equates to mid single digit growth organically. As we\u2019ve seen before UOP can be lumpy and as a result we expect their organic growth to be mid single digit in the quarter as we lack higher catalysts in service sales. Advance materials into the third quarter is expected to see an improvement in organic growth with sales up mid single digit reflecting improved production levels at Hopewell in the resins and chemicals business and also the restart of Metropolis as I mentioned earlier in the floorings products business both of those in the third quarter.","Finally in Transportation Systems, we\u2019re expecting sales to be up 2% to 4% reflecting strong uptake of new launches and also the growth in turbo penetration globally. The growth is against the backdrop of lower EU, light vehicle production rates expected to be down 3% year-over-year contemplating a slight inventory correction in Europe as we move into the summer shutdown season. Now we expect a lift in the TS margin rate year-over-year helped in part by the footprint transition that I mentioned earlier although we expect given their strong margin rate performance in the second quarter that TS sequentially their margin will be flat to slightly down now in the third quarter.","So with that in mind let\u2019s turn to slide 11, where we\u2019ll walk through some of the second half drivers that could push us towards the lower high end of our guidance range. So looking at slide 11 entitled to second half 2013 guidance framework, let me just give a couple of highlights. In terms of our key assumptions, again for commercial aircraft we expect growth will be an important contributor to the second half outlook; we are lapping a relatively earlier, which is to say a more normal year-over-year cost. At the mid point of the range we\u2019ve assumed the aftermarket sales are largely in line with utilization with the likely case the airlines continue to aggressively manage inventory levels, but that improving flight hour growth will equate to more normal buying patterns consistent with what we saw at the end of the second quarter.","For ESSs the business was up roughly 2% organic in the first half driven by again ECC security and improvements in life safety. And while the composition may fluctuate a little bit in the recovery we\u2019re still expecting low to mid single digit growth overall for ESS with no change in the overall economic backdrop. Now the composition of PMT growth is expected to be different UOP sales would be up organically but at a slightly lower rate with lower petrochemical catalyst shipments sequentially in the second half which would create an unfavorable mix dynamic. And as we referenced earlier we should see a meaningful improvement in both R&C and flooring products in the second half for both those businesses.","Pricing will also continue to be an important variable with our mid point based on stable prices at today's levels. For Turbo in the second half, we\u2019ll be watching obviously the note that summer shutdown plans of the OEMs with our base case assumption best described as stable which would translate into second half EU light vehicle production down just slightly on a year-over-year basis.","Finally rounding up our list, we have China sales which we thought of more broadly as barometer for our high growth market and the Euro and FX rate which will continue to plan for at the 125 at the midpoint. So taking these elements into account complemented by a continued assumption of strong cost controls, strong execution by the businesses we think this gives us a balanced range of plus or minus $0.05 around $4.90 at the mid point for the full-year.","So now let\u2019s turn to slide 12, where we\u2019ll put it all together from a full-year perspective. Now the slides are a little different than we\u2019ve given you in the past, but we think it will be helpful for you to understand the dynamics of our second half outlook. First full-year sales reflect our first half performance and no change to the second half outlook where sales for the full-year expected to be up 3% to 4% or 1% to 2% on an organic basis. Now the reported basis we could see an impact based on the timing of the Intermec close, but we feel it\u2019s incorporated into a range at this point and we\u2019re reworking to complete the transaction in the third quarter.","Second, margins are estimated to be 16% to 16.2% for the full-year 2013, up 40 to 60 basis points year-over-year.","Now, as we discussed, you can see the estimated impact in the third quarter to segment margin due to the dilutive impact of Intermec, RAE systems and the Thomas Russell acquisition, roughly a 50 basis point headwind in the third quarter in terms of our margin rates which translates to $0.02 to $0.03, think of that as $0.03 of EPS headwind for the quarter.","Now obviously on the subject of M&A as the integrations occur and the cost synergies are realized, the M&A will be a benefit for us in 2014 and beyond. Even with that headwind, you can see that our full-year guidance is roughly at or above the low end of our 2014 margin targets with significant contributions coming from advanced materials and transportation systems in the fourth quarter.","Finally on EPS we're raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.05, making the new range $4.85 to $4.95. And as we referenced earlier, we continue to use a full-year tax rate of 26.5% which would be flat to 2012 with no impact year-over-year. However, as we think about the linearity within 2013, again the first half EPR of about 23% was below the full-year rate and so we've guided now to 26.5% for the third and for modeling purposes we're expecting a tax headwind in the fourth quarter which works out to be approximately $0.11 versus our 26.5% full-year planning assumption.","Now we take this updated range captures our strong performance in the first half. It's appropriately balanced for the remaining risks and opportunities we've talked about in the second half. And as for the takeaways, it's important to be clear that we're not counting on a macro lift in the second half.","So now let's turn to slide 13 for a brief wrap-up before we turn it over to you and Elena for Q&A. In summary, on slide 13, the second quarter results puts us another step closer to delivering on the high expectations that we set out for you last December. As expected, the environment has remained challenging, but Honeywell has continued to see strong execution supporting its results. And consistent with our prior views, we're not expecting, not counting on a big second half recovery.","We've seen pockets of short-cycle improvements. The costs are getting easier and the investments in residential construction do seem to be improving and again evidence of that in our ESS businesses. However, while we have seen some signs of improving activity, non-residential investment remains weak and it will be watching the customer demand signals in Aerospace and Automotive obviously very closely in the second half. Our emerging markets are not likely to accelerate in the near term, so probably the best way to summarize our end market expectations for the second half is really just stable.","With that in mind, we'll continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity including delivering on the strong project pipeline we've already funded. And new product introductions which are the lifeblood of our growth will remain on overdrive, helping to deliver next quarter, next year and beyond. You'll see evidence of that in the wide range of exciting new wins that Dave highlighted at the start of this call.","So with that, Elena, let's go over to you for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, David. With that, we'll now take our first question on the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thanks and good morning, Dave, Dave, Elena.","David M. Cote","Hi, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C.

Anderson","Pricing or commercial excellence is one of the things that we have focused on for a long time and it gets geared towards the value that we provide with a lot of our new products and services, but I don't have the number at the top of my head.","Elena Doom","It's up several basis points to the margin rate expansion in the quarter.","David M. Cote","I think another way to say it is and this is a theme, Steve, where we talk about a lot is pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. That's what we're just going to continue to do.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. I'm just trying to get a sense for the unit versus pricing impact to that. That's helpful. And on Defense & Space down 8%, I know you mentioned it in line with the planned ramp-downs and expectations, but I recall from the Defense & Space Day a plan that was just close to full sequestration but not at full sequestration. Are you planning numbers now and incorporating kind of a full sequestration impact over the remaining next \u2013 on a multiyear basis?","David J. Anderson","Well, the way we planned it and I think I've said this before, but we'd assumed about 80% of the sequestration impact and had contingency plans for the remaining 20% just assuming that that was probably the best bet is unfolded that way. We launched a contingency plan, so yeah everything we're reflecting and the way we're looking at the company going forward is to assume sequestration stays.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay.","Elena Doom","And what that basically gives you about a 4% decline in D&S sales for 2013 versus 2012.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. And I know you can't say too much about it, but on the ELT topic that's come out and your announcement on that, I'm just still trying to get my head around something that doesn't seem to have enough power to generate the heat that would be required to melt the frame in kind of non-rechargeable self-contained basis. Any kind of color you might provide that this may be more than that or I just don't get \u2013 I'm just struggling with the kind of physics of the issue?","David M. Cote","Yeah, I get a couple of comments. The first one is my biggest learning from going through a number of these kinds of investigations in the past is to wait to find out what the final result is before opining on anything as these things just \u2013 they go all over the place. The media loves it. So, any little snip that they pick up anywhere they report. And I've just learned that wait, wait until they've done the job and when you look at the AIB and the FAA, they'll do a good job sorting this whole thing through. So we'll just wait to find out what the actuals are and respond to it then. In the meantime with anything that have been discussed, we could say there's no significant financial impact to Honeywell in any way.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, all right. Let me get off. Thanks.","David M. Cote","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hi, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","The one thing that there wasn't a slide on was really cash usage and can you give us a sense of \u2013 and maybe on a forward look really, I mean next six months, next 12 months if given the M&A pipe you have out there, what kind of cash opportunity you have to put things to work?","David J. Anderson","I'll probably just talk a little bit about the quarter. We've bought back shares in the quarter I think was 6 million shares in the quarter, so that was an attractive I think use of cash. We closed on the RAE systems. Due to regulatory review, the close on Intermec was pushed into the third quarter. We'll close on Intermec in the third quarter. That's mid $600 million in terms of acquisition. And I would say Scott right now just on a forward-looking basis, Dave get your views on this, I think the acquisition pipeline is relatively attractive.","It's always a matter of the distance between the cup and the lip and seeing the whites of the eyes of these opportunities in terms of a full due diligence and valuation and a very disciplined approach, Scott, that we take to M&A. But I will continue to say to you that I think that we're very, very well positioned for inorganic growth to complement our organic growth in this environment. And the other thing we'll continue to do is we'll continue to look at, on a dividend standpoint, we'll look at doing the right thing there in the context of growing earnings and what makes sense in terms of dividend payout. Don't you think, Dave, that's the best\u2026?","David J. Anderson","Yeah, the strategy remains the same, Scott, and we'll continue to be very disciplined as Dave said when it comes to acquisitions. We haven't lost our mind there and I'd say the next thing about having a full pipeline is it allows you to be more disciplined in what you go after.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Yeah, agreed. I mean since you've done a nice job in the past I think it's always been interesting seeing more of it but that's a high class problem.","David J. Anderson","We'll continue to be smart about it, I can promise you that.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Yes. Guys, I want to talk a little bit about EOP and then I'll pass it on. I mean this is a business that I\u2019m not sure, I know I\u2019ve never been able to forecast and I\u2019m guessing where a lot of other people struggle there I mean, it's been outgrowing the end market for quite some time now, and with less volatility than we use to get it, it used to be a -- it was always a great business but it used to be much more volatile. It's scary to me only because we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve had so many good quarters in a row here, I mean what, what's changed in this business that makes it so much of a better business now or less volatile business now or maybe even more predictable now than what we used to get. Are we going to get blown up one of these quarters, on this thing and not see it coming?","David M. Cote","Yeah, I think that\u2019s where you were going. While at the end of the day quarter-to-quarter it's still, I mean lumpy is the word we\u2019ve always used. Some don\u2019t like it but it's true. Quarter-to-quarter is always going to be lumpy. Year-to-year though the forecast stability if that\u2019s the word is pretty reasonable and should continue to grow. It's not just the end market goodness that we\u2019ve seen. But you\u2019ve heard me talk about it before when it comes to UOP, but we\u2019ve done a significant amount of seed planting here. If you go back to when it was a JV, you\u2019ve heard me say before that when one partner wanted to invest the other didn\u2019t, and that was true for us too. And as a result of that there was 20 years of just kind of ambling along just terrific technologies, people, culture everything but it was really ambling along more than anything else. We really invigorated that when we took over the whole thing and put a lot more money into R&D and horizon free spending. You don\u2019t see it right away, but over the course of that ensuing six or seven years, man it has started to pay off really well and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing the benefits are which allows us to put even more money back into it to develop new things. You\u2019ve seen it happen in some of the cultural changes as they\u2019ve expanded globally improving a reach that used to be more mental than physical and we just have more people out there now than we ever did before and all those things taken together the technology, the money we\u2019ve put into it, the people outreach, the customer outreach is just really paying off very well.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","It looks like it is. Thank you guys, good luck.","David M. Cote","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","David M. Cote","Hey, Howard.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","I want to go into aerospace for a moment, just two things, one is could you characterize where you\u2019re spending research and development and how you look for that, what were the numbers Dave this year versus last and how do you characterize it please.","David M. Cote","Well, I\u2019d characterize it as we like all the businesses that we\u2019re in, in aerospace, so we support them all with R&D. In terms of big programs that are all the ones which you\u2019re familiar with like the A350 and the wins that we\u2019ve gotten over the last four, five years. In terms of the overall spending growth investments continue in aerospace. I don\u2019t know if we disclosed the specific numbers.","Elena Doom","We spend just under 8% of sales on R&D that\u2019s funded from the Company.","David M. Cote","That I would say, Howard one of the things that we\u2019ve tried to do is consistent with the seed planting point is, we\u2019re still investing in all the businesses when it comes to the growth investments that we\u2019ve talked about because we don\u2019t want to just make this quarter this year, we want to make it next year, six years from now, ten years from now; sp all the businesses are doing a really good job of reinvesting.","Elena Doom","And that spending level is up about $75 million, $80 million on a year-over-year basis.","David M. Cote","Per year.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","That\u2019s on the quarter or that should mean \u2026","Elena Doom","For the year.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","For the year. And it sounds like you\u2019re putting a little more emphasis on mechanical and based on some things that Tim seemed to have said lately; is there some incremental opportunities there?","David M. Cote","I like both, both the mechanical and the electronic side, and increasingly we\u2019re seeing an interplay between mechanical and electronic and that\u2019s what you see with like the electric taxi. We do like the components business, the mechanical components business as we\u2019ve discussed and there is a place where you can truly differentiate with technology, and I think Tim mentioned that we -- at Investor Day that we had about $4 billion in wins on mechanical components to, we had not anticipated in the past. So, I like the whole thing.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","And then just to change Dave to talk about ESS, I mean there is clearly either it\u2019s a change in the market or is some product differentiation, could you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the successes that you\u2019ve achieved there and address on the momentum please?","David J. Anderson","Maybe I could just start there upon numbers, just add a little bit more color to what we talked about in the second quarter. Then I will ask Dave to talk a little bit about some of the innovation, some of the things that are really kind of continue to drive ESS growth going forward. We saw as I mentioned, in my comments, we saw good growth in the second quarter ECC security and in Fire particularly. The Fire was up 6% globally, ECC was up 5% globally and HSG, the Security business was up 7% globally. And the numbers are all better in the U.S. for those businesses. So, whether its call it retrofit, residential retrofit or some benefits of improved housing starts is a little bit of evidence as well as that when you look at the ECS, ECC homes business. It\u2019s clearly, and the momentum has been building. You can see it. It\u2019s not like its spiked. You actually can see the momentum building. And as Dave said, kind of back to the broader team, we completed our strap reviews last week; I mean there is just a lot of good stuff that\u2019s going on within that group of businesses.","David M. Cote","Yeah, I would go back to the seed planting point Howard, it may seem like a \u2013 an overused message here, but man it\u2019s the truth, its the money that we put in the past are just developing products that people want, that help develop adjacencies where people may be didn\u2019t even realize that was a product that could solve their problem. We are doing that in every single business across the company and which you\u2019re seeing in ESS is a function of that. So the only business that has continue to be a little bit slower is the sensing and control business largely driven by a weak industrial environment, but same thing there. They\u2019ve got some great stuff coming that\u2019s helping to mitigate that and I think portends a pretty good future.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you all very much.","David M. Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey, good morning.","David J. Anderson","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Can you guys just may be walk through if there has been any change to any of the segment revenue forecasts for the year, that doesn\u2019t seem to many, but are there any kind of tweaks up or down? Obviously, it didn\u2019t change sales, but within that \u2013 the segments?","David J. Anderson","Well Elena, do you want to talk about that from a guidance standpoint?","Elena Doom","Sure.","David J. Anderson","We tweak slightly up or overall revenue guidance for the year and if you could talk about that by segment.","Elena Doom","Sure. We raised it by $100 million reflecting the second quarter revenues coming in at the high-end of our guidance. When you look at the businesses, for Aerospace there is really a little bit of a change, upward relative to the midpoint by may be $50 million. If you look at ACS, ACS is still on track relative to their, call it $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion for the year, so that\u2019s up again at the midpoint slightly on \u2013 versus our prior guide. PMT is looking potentially a little bit lower, so $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion versus, that maybe at the midpoint about a $100 million less and then TS is, we\u2019re still continuing the outlook there, given as Dave referenced the potential for some inventory correction in the third quarter, given the strength that we had in the second quarter.","David J. Anderson","So really just refinements, I think you would say to those numbers.","Elena Doom","Yeah exactly on the midpoint plus or minus $50 million to $100 million.","David J. Anderson","Right.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Got you. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning folks.","David M. Cote","Mr. Sprague, how are you?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","I\u2019m doing good Mr. Cote. How are you? Hey, can we talk about China a little bit?","David M. Cote","(Indiscernible) when you say it.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","You know, if I think about what seems to be playing out from a macro standpoint, it sounds worrisome and you\u2019re now the third or fourth Company this earnings season that sounds actually better and more comped. You're the fourth company in this earnings season that sounds actually better and more confident. I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more on some new advantage point what you think really is going on? And is it CapEx driven or people catching up on maintenance? Any impact from the full shadow banking question, just ask for your collective wits on what's going on there?","David M. Cote","The collective wit that makes us assemble us but at the end of the day, as you know long term I'm very much a believer in China and what I think they can accomplish. And it's going to endure its ups and downs for a variety of reasons but I do think that that kind of 6% to 7% GDP type planning is the way to go. We have seen some downturn as we talked about in I guess the first four or five months of the year. I think that was more, I'd say, a correction than anything else responding to tightening money. We still see the impact of some of that on something like airline spares where in China I think the fourth quarter was up like 30% or 40% in anticipation of what was going to come, so first six months continued to be low. That's another one that I do think comes back at some point. So I'm a believer long term and I think we're going to continue do well there.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","I was actually also a little surprised. I think you said China's up 14 overall. I would have expected that would have been driven largely by ACS but I think the comment was ACS China up 6. So where did it really come in, it is TS or was it somewhere else?","David M. Cote","Well, we had good growth. Let me talk a little bit about that, Jeff. We had good growth kind of across the board. We had good growth in aero R&O. We had good growth in the ECS short cycle you said at the number we mentioned earlier. But also in the long cycle businesses of ACS, we had good growth in UOP particularly at two projects that completed where there was revenue conversion. And HTT in the turbo business, what we've seen is kind of a rebound now in the commercial vehicle business sales and our penetration there, as you know, is good. So we saw good growth in turbo as well. By the way we expect that to continue into the second half, which is a nice tailwind for that business and into 2014. So it's not an individual business. It really is kind of \u2013 I mean there's a few exceptions that go the other way but in general when you look across the Honeywell portfolio, China looks pretty good.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And then just on restructuring, I mean obviously the story is well understood on Honeywell operationally it's a much better company today than it was 8 or 10 years ago. It's all your credit on the line. It seems like you continue to find a lot of restructuring opportunities, I mean intuitively I think they get harder to find in their longer payback and instead you continue to find and then the paybacks are decent. Is it actually because of HOS and other things it was actually getting easier to find stuff to do, things that maybe weren't obvious or not jumping out. How do we get our head around that?","David M. Cote","Yeah, I would say we're never going to be devoid of ideas and we were getting some of the same kind of questions if you recall, Jeff, even five or six years ago and I think as long as we keep focused on those key process initiatives, so the Honeywell operating system as you mentioned where we're just getting to the point where we're 70% or 80% bronze and we've still got silver and gold to go and there's big benefits in each of those cases. Functional transformation, you've heard me say we expect another 1.5 to 2 points of margin expansion over time just coming from that. And velocity product development which helps to reduce the overall cost of R&D and that frees up additional resources for us to be able to do more in new programs. So I'm going to point all three of those and say, every one of those initiatives helps us to come up with more and more ideas as we got forward. And it's not like we're scrapping the barrel to find ideas. There's still plenty more out there.","David J. Anderson","One thing maybe just to add to that very quickly is Dave's kind of underpinning all of it is the continued investment that we make in the ERP, EPS implementation which is a big enabler and a foundation that's really supporting the efficiency productivity across all of the items that they've mentioned, Jeff.","David M. Cote","I think that's a good point, Dave, because that's particularly true in ACS. If you take a look at that, that's the business that has been I guess the most complicated to get SAP installed and we're finally getting to a critical mass there with the 60% or 65% by the end of the year completed, and we're starting to see the benefits of that. So I still see lots of good ideas to come.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Great, thanks. Good work.","David M. Cote","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","David M. Cote","Hi.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on Aerospace aftermarket, could you give us more color by region as to how this 2% improvement was across the globe?","Elena Doom","Andrew, so I guess the color I would start with is if you look at the large aero transport and regional market, which is really the big commercial jets, the aftermarket there was up 2%. And what we really were looking at there is an indicator versus flight hours with the fares growth. So the fares were up 4%. R&O was down slightly. From a regional perspective, I'd call out that China continued to see the same phenomena that we had in the first quarter with fares down large double digit partially offset by about a mid teen percent growth in the R&O business. So for total China which again, we've been watching because the dynamics have really shifted in 2013. The overall aftermarket was down slightly but significant and some good improvement versus the first quarter.","David J. Anderson","Yeah, and that R&O growth which you cited and we had good numbers in the U.S., we had good numbers in EMEA. So that's what really supported it.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow-up on the question on China, your strong performance there, can you guys separate your strategy where you're taking market share, you're going to later markets versus the underlying markets? How much of it is do you think macro on the ground versus how much of it is your \u2013 the company-specific strategy?","David M. Cote","Well, I'd say that's a tough one to ever sort out but I would say you're right about the focus on becoming the Chinese competitor. It does make a difference. It's not the easiest markets to measure when it comes to what the overall size is. But I do know that's making a difference. I'd be hard pressed to be able to say how much of the growth is because of the market versus what we're doing specifically.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","David M. Cote","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote","Hi, Peter.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Hi. Just first a clarification on the comments on Defense being down 8% and kind of your expectations in the second half of the year heading into '14. Is it still the expectation that '14 still would look better than '13 given the international programs, or has that changed with sequestration?","David J. Anderson","I'll think you'll see likely a decline, Peter, in 2014 for D&S but at a lesser rate than 4% that we're forecasting, guiding to for 2013.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay.","David J. Anderson","We see some improvement in the rate of decline for D&S in 2014 would be our current thinking.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, thank you.","David M. Cote","It's a positive statement, Peter.","David J. Anderson","It takes years to develop them.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Back to Jeff's question on the restructuring comments, in particular I guess to Defense & Space, given the softness you are seeing, you've made a lot of progress already on all the enablers that you have across all the businesses but in particular Aerospace. How do we think about restructuring opportunities as Defense kind of softens here?","David M. Cote","I think for us it's less of it \u2013 whatever Defense decline we run into, I think you've heard me talk about this some in the past. It's not that big a deal for us when it comes to what kind of the impact are we structuring because Defense is more of a sales channels than it is a let's say specific market with specific products. It's really just kind of similar jet engines that we make for commercial, go into military, APUs, the electronics. So it's pretty easy for us to just shift the engineering resources and plant production from working on Defense to working on commercial. People don't need to move. You don't need to rehire anywhere, so it's pretty straightforward for us.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay. And just if I could squeeze in one last one. On the electric taxi, which was a cool demo in Paris, but how do we think about \u2013 can you give us any sort of color on the customer interest that you saw and when will we expect to see some of those customers sign up? I know entry into service isn't until 2016?","David M. Cote","Yeah, this one's been pretty cool because when we first came out with the idea, there was a lot of interest more than I have to admit. I really expected right from the beginning because usually it takes some time. The interesting part is that interest has grown and the amount of publicity that we got for that electric taxi and the increasing speed so that it outraces a human today and will do even better in the future is pretty exciting. So there's a huge amount of interest. I can't predict when the first order comes in but I'm pretty confident in this product. This really looks like we jointly have a winner here.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, and that's great. Thanks.","David M. Cote","Thanks.","Elena Doom","Jack, we have time for one more question before we hand the call back over to Dave Cote for his final comments.","Operator","All right. We'll take our last question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Hi. A couple things, first on Europe, you guys have been seeing some improvements in Europe for the last couple quarters. What's better there, what's not?","David M. Cote","It's been \u2013 I'd say the short cycle side has actually been showing improvement and we're not ready to declare victory on this one yet because it's kind of \u2013 it's tough to see end market or macro conditions supporting a big bounce there, but it's been encouraging to see so far the new product introductions that we've had do help. Our expectations were low and we've planned pretty conservatively, but it's been pretty much across the board on the short cycle side. Turbos did better, the ACS businesses did better so it's been kind of across the board.","David J. Anderson","I've mentioned earlier, Peter, when we talk about the fact that \u2013 I'm sorry, Shannon, we talked earlier too about the Aero business and we saw reasonably good numbers in terms of the EMEA or the European aftermarket for Aerospace as well. So, as Dave said, it's no single item but \u2013 I mean the good news is when you look at our short cycle businesses to your point there against the backdrop of the macros, it's really very good performance.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","And then just on CapEx, we haven't really seen that go up yet year-to-date. Is there any change to your plan there or is that going to ramp more kind of second half of this year and into '14 and any color there?","David M. Cote","I would say the plans haven't really changed to your point but both the UOP and fluorine plants we need to build because we have the orders for them already, so this just more a matter of timing than anything else.","David J. Anderson","Yeah, you would anticipate given the point you make, Shannon, that's a good observation that the third quarter for example we're going to see cash flow probably a little lower than prior year as a result of that ramp-up in CapEx, so we'll probably give back a little bit of that favorability that we've got on a year-to-date basis as we've got very nice cumulative free cash flow favorability going into the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","David M. Cote","Thanks. Very well. We continue to be confident in our ability to outperform even in this weak macro environment and all the feed planting we've done and continue to do for growth in productivity around the world and in every business makes a huge difference for us.

We recorded earnings per share of $1.66 normalized at our expected full year tax rate. This is $0.02 above the high end of the guidance we\u2019ve provided in January, excluding divestitures and normalizing for tax EPS was up 11% versus 2016 or 10% on a reported basis. Organic sales were up more than 2% and we recorded double-digit revenue growth in advance materials with performance material technologies on demand for our Solstice product line and we saw continued strengthen UOP as the oil and gas end markets improve.","In home and building technologies, our global distribution business continued to outpace the market, while the products business generated strong results at 3% organic growth. In Aerospace, we have strong performance in the aftermarket, particularly in air transport and robust repair and overhauled activity, and in Safety and Productivity Solutions we saw growth in most of the businesses, particularly noteworthy performance exhibited in Workflow Solutions, expensing in IoT as well as Industrial Safety.","We expanded segment margins by 70 basis points, we\u2019re delivering high value offerings to our customers and our execution is improving as the ongoing benefits of our HOS Gold operating systems materialize. We also continue to optimize our cost structure that I highlighting our March Investor Day. Driven by productivity initiatives and the restructuring actions we took through 2016. Driving segment margin improvement continues to be an ongoing focus for Honeywell.","We delivered significant improvement in free cash flow year-over-year, largely driven by improved working capital performance. Free cash flow performance will continue to be a key priority for Honeywell. We have -- our new level of focused on working capital at all levels across the company and we expect we will drive improved free cash flow conversion in every business. ","Given the strong performance, we are raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to $6.90 to $7.10 and reaffirming our 2017 organic sales, segment margin and free cash flow guidance. We are encouraged by the first quarter growth and execution, but are taking on tempered approach to our forward outlook given the potential volatility in our end markets and limited view of the year at this time.","Each of our business had significant commercial achievements in the first quarter. On Slide 3, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the them. In Aerospace, together with Airbus we announced that our auxiliary power unit is now standard equipment on the A320 family of aircraft replacing a competitors APU as the base option. Airbus selected Honeywell because of our APU's superior reliability and the fuel savings capability. In addition, both Japan Airlines and India's Jet Airways announced that they are using our GoDirect fuel efficiency software. Fuel consumption typically accounts for as much as 20% to 40% of our airlines operating cost and GoDirect can help customers to save more than 2% annually.","In Home and Building Technologies, we launched MAXPRO Cloud for connected buildings. MAXPRO provides streamlined video and access management to our customers that manage multiple buildings. In addition, Honeywell Building Solutions announced contracts to improve energy efficiency at 21 U.S. Federal Aviation and Administration Facilities and at the U.S. Air Force based in Los Angeles, as well as airport wins in emerging regions including Turkey and Singapore.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, UOP Technologies and Honeywell process solutions controls were selected in China for one of the largest crude to chemicals complexes in the world. In addition, UOP will provide the process technology for the largest Oleflex units in Europe. And UOP hydro treating catalyst will be used by Wantong Petrochemical to produce cleaner burning ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, without a cost re-modification of its existing hydrotreating unit. As you will hear shortly, the orders thus far for PMT have been very strong, our customers recognize the value of Honeywell's technologies and this is allowing us to win the marketplace especially in China.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we introduced our AutoCube, a 3D dimensioning system that helps customers instantly capture the volume of parcels to enable space optimization in the volume base pricing. Safety and Productivity Solutions also won four prestigious international forum IF Design Awards recognizing our product design focus in the Honeywell user experience. As you know driving organic sales growth is one of the my key priorities, I'm pleased with the results we saw in the first quarter, investing in development of new products, breakthrough initiatives and commercial excellence will help us to accelerate our momentum.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to discuss our financial results in more detail.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Darius. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we delivered more than 2% organic sales growth this quarter. Now truth be told, we were actually within inches of 3%, but it did come out at 2%. All of our segments were at or above the high end of the sales guidance we provided back in January, so a strong start from a growth perspective.","Segment profit was up 8%, excluding divestitures and segment margins expanded 70 basis points from 2016. This accounted for the bulk of the EPS expansion as you'll see in a minute. The segment profit growth was driven by sales improvement, our ongoing productivity initiatives that benefits from the significant restructuring programs that were funded in 2016. And overall frontend commercial excellence.","Reported earnings per share of $1.71 were up 10%, this $1.71 includes a $0.05 benefit from a lower than anticipated tax rate. So for proper comparability and to remove all tax favorability from our results, we\u2019ve normalized 2016 to reflect the expected 2017 full year tax rate and to eliminate the $0.05 from 2016, relating to the divested businesses. On that basis, EPS was up 11% or a $1.66 and that\u2019s as Darius said, $0.02 above the high end of the guidance range.","Free cash flow performance was also encouraging in the quarter, as Darius mentioned, the entire organization at all levels is focused on our working capital performance. We\u2019re breaking down our order to cash processes into myriad of sub-segments and we\u2019re systematically measuring and improving the cycle time of each of those sub-segments. We\u2019re adjusting incentives to foster more improvement in working capital and we have a standard operating cadence that culminates in a monthly review with Darius and me by each business.","There is still much to do in this area, and while it is still early in the year we\u2019re encourage by our progress so far. So, overall a very strong start to 2017, but still a lot of opportunity for further improvement over the next three quarters.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 5 and discuss each of the segments. In Aerospace, we finished the quarter above the high end of our first quarter sales guidance range, driven primarily by a strong performance in the air transport aftermarket. We saw an uplift in spares demand and strength and repair and overhaul activities with our airline customers particularly in the sales, repairs, modifications and upgrades, that resulted in high single-digit growth rate in the APR aftermarket. The aftermarket in business and generally aviation was roughly flat with stronger than anticipated RNO and connectivity revenue, largely offset by a decline in spares.","Our OE performance was as expected with volumes to our air transport customers up slightly on the strength of A350 shipments, offset by declines in business and general aviation. Defense sales were roughly flat with the strong organic sales growth in our core U.S. and International Defense businesses offset by space and commercial helicopter weakness. And there was continued strength in light vehicle gas turbo penetration particularly driven by new launches in Europe and china. As well there was some encouraging signs in the on-highway commercial vehicle market globally and most notably in China and in Europe.","Aerospace segment margin expansion in the quarter of 90 basis points also exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Driven by productivity, commercial excellence and the favorable impact of the divestiture of the government services business in 2016. Overall a very strong start to 2017 for Aerospace.","Home and Building Technologies generated organic sales growth of 3% driven by a strong performance in environmental and energy solutions, security and fire and our global distribution businesses. Growth in the China business and HBT was nearly 15% this quarter, that was led by the clean air and water product portfolios and ENS [ph]. We continue to see momentum in the residential real-estate market in China, anticipate continued infrastructure investment that will help to drive future growth.","Across HBT there was gradual sales improvement over the quarter with decent exit momentum. Segment margin while below our expectation was still quite strong at 70 basis points improvement. Extending from our ongoing productivity initiatives and the restructuring actions taken in the second half of 2016. The mix dynamics of sales in the quarter were bit less favorable than we anticipated.","Performance materials and technologies had a very strong quarter. Sales up 5% on an organic basis, margins expanded 260 basis points and orders were up double-digits. The performance was led by advanced materials where a softer sales growth exceeded a 150% on an organic basis, enabled by the capital investments we've made over the past several years. Sales in UOP were up 3% organic led by gas processing, there continues to be increasing interest in domestic modular units in particular.","In the first quarter alone we signed 6 new deals in the U.S. for pre-engineered cryogenic plants that separate natural gas liquids. This compares favorably to the 12 units we had for all of 2016 including 2 in the first quarter. Growth in the catalyst business was at low-single digits driven by new Oleflex Units. The orders in UOP were up over 15% in the first quarter segments days for continued performance in this business. Sales and process solutions were roughly flat on an organic basis.","We had healthy customer adoption of our insurance 360 service offering and good growth in our lifecycles solutions and services business. This was offset by slower sales in our large projects business. Orders in HPS were up nearly 10% on an organic basis. The margin expansion in PMT was driven by productivity, commercial excellence initiatives and the impact of the spin-off of the former resins and chemicals business in 2016. So all in all great results to PMT and encouraging forward indicators across all of its business units.","Finally, in SPS organic sales were up 3% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Industrial safety is the largest business within SPS grew 4% on organic basis driven by our high risk and gas detection offerings. There was also a significant growth in our workflow solutions business due to strong demand and improved supply chain execution. Growth in our IoT business was also strong with good performance in a number of regions and Intelligrated grew in excess of 20% this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2016 when it was not own by Honeywell and this was driven by large products in a number of key accounts.","Excluding the first year's dilutive impact from M&A, SPS segment margins expanded more than 300 basis points driven by continued productivity and restructuring benefits and the conversion on the strong sales volume. We\u2019re encouraged by the trends that we saw in the first quarter in SPS and in the rest of the portfolio.","Slide 6 contains a walk of our EPS from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of last year earnings from our 2016 divestitures were $0.05 and we exclude those amounts from the 2016 baseline, consistent with the 2017 earnings guidance framework we provided. For comparison purposes, as I said earlier we\u2019ve also normalized the tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 for the expected 2017 full year tax rate and this effect was minor as you can see.","In the first quarter of 2017, the segment improvement I highlighted for each business accounted for $0.12 of the year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. Below the line items and a slightly lower share count contributed $0.04 this quarter, bringing our 2017 EPS excluding benefits from the lower tax rate to $1.66, which is that $0.02 beat to the $1.64 high end of our first quarter guidance.","EPS increased 11% year-over-year on this basis and for the full year we expect our share count to be consistent with the 772 million shares we projected in January. Regarding tax, our planned tax rate for the quarter was about 25%, but the actual rate was 22.7%, with the difference contributing an additional $0.05 of EPS growth resulting a reported EPS of $1.71. Our expectations that the effective tax rate in quarters two, three and four will be at or above 25% and to the extent that change will provide an update.","Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss what we\u2019re seeing in our end markets heading into the second quarter. Last quarter, we told you about some encouraging trends in our oil and gas businesses and those have continued this quarter. The combined UOP and HPS book to bill ratio was strong at 1.15 and UOP orders as I've said earlier were up over 15% driven by our gas processing business.","The domestic rustle businesses has outpaced our expectations as the demand for non-gas liquid separation technologies strengthened in the U.S. There are also more orders for licensing which is typically one of the first indicators that the oil and gas cycle is restarting. The activity in UOP China has been particularly strong and we\u2019ve got a number of key projects which will allow us to leverage the capacity investments we\u2019ve made over the past two years.","Within Home and Building Technologies in the second quarter, we anticipate several large smart meter project rollouts in Europe and better backlog conversions in the Americas. Smart meter business came to Honeywell as part of the Elster acquisition and it continues to perform well. Overall the short cycle demand in the commercial and residential segments continues to be robust. The aviation market continues to be resilient with the high end single digit growth driven by spares demand and repairs modification and upgrades in the air transport and regional business. This is supported by the outlook for continued flight hour growth of 4% to 5% in air transport and regional.","In the business in general aviation market, we had strong demand in the repair at overhaul business, but weaker performance in spares, driven by a continued decline in maintenance events.","We expect continued aftermarkets strength heading into the second quarter, with the airlines business growing faster than BGA. Flight hours in BGA are likely to remain flat to down in 2017. Our connectivity business grew double digits in the first quarter and will continue to be a source of strength for aftermarket revenues. We were encouraged by the increased activity in our businesses that serve the industrial sector. Our industrial safety business was up mid-single digits driven by demand for gas detection in high risk safety equipment. The backlog and pipeline of future orders at Intelligrated continues to be strong and we are encouraged about the prospects for 2017. As planned, we expect lower shipments and fewer engine maintenance events than 2016 for business jets. We continue to plan conservatively and do not anticipate a recovery until the 2018, 2019 time frame.","And we on Slide 9 with a preview of the second quarter. Aerospace sales are expected to be in the flat to down 2% range on an organic basis with continued strength from the ATR aftermarket and solid demand in the U.S. core defense. In transportation systems, we anticipate continued recovery in the commercial vehicles business combined with growth in light vehicle gas applications especially in China. These benefits will be offset by the ongoing secular softness in the BGA and space markets. We expect reported sales will be down 5% to 7% due to the 2016 divestiture of the government service business.","Aero margin expansion would be driven primarily by the benefits from our 2016 restructuring projects and a stronger mix of aftermarket growth. Importantly, the second quarter is expected to be the last quarter of the headwind associated with OEM incentives. In the second half they become an approximate 70 million tailwind to sales and segment margin as compared to an approximate 25 million headwind in the first half. In Home and Buildings technologies reported sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% due to the impacts of foreign currency translation. With organic sales growth up 2% to 4% driven by the large Elster smart meter rollouts, I mentioned earlier.","In the other products business we expect continued contributions from new products introductions like our T-series thermostat and do it yourself security products which were on display earlier this month at IFC web [ph]. In China, we again expect double-digit growth driven by continued air and water demand and growth in security and fire systems associated with large real-estate projects. We also expect continued strength in our global distribution business and stronger growth in building solutions.","HPTs segment margins are expected to expand 70 basis points to 100 basis points driven by cost reductions from prior restructuring actions commercial excellence in ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset by product mix headwinds associated with strength of our distribution sales. In PMT, we anticipate continued strong performance across the group with 3% to 5% organic sales growth. Advanced materials is expected to be up significantly and continued demand for Solstice's lower global warming products.","UOP improving oil and gas markets and the strong backlog will drive continued growth, primarily in licensing and equipment sales. We also expect modest growth in the process solutions business driven primarily by our short-cycle software and service offering. On a reported basis PMT sales are expected to be down year-over-year due to the spin-off of resins and chemicals business in the fourth quarter.","The projected segment margins expansion of a 170 basis points to 200 basis points is driven by higher volumes productivity and the impact of this spin-off of the former resins and chemicals business.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions sales are expected to be up flat, or to be flat to up 2% on an organic basis, with recorded sales increasing north of 25% due to the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition. The organic growth will be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as the significant workflow solutions growth we saw from improved supply chain execution in the first quarter normalizes in the second quarter. In the safety business, growth in the industrial business will be driven by new product introduction and better end market outlooks.","In Intelligrated, orders were strong exciting the first quarter and we anticipate double-digit growth to continue. SPS margins are expected to expand by more than 250 basis points excluding the first year of dilutive impacts with M&A, driven primarily by benefits from last year's restructuring projects and by the sales growth and ongoing productivity initiatives. For the company in total we\u2019re expecting EPS of $1.75 to $1.80, which will be up 7% to 10% year-over-year excluding 2016 divestitures and normalizing for our expected full year tax rate. Organic sales growth is anticipated to be flat to 2% with 50 basis points to 80 basis points of margin expansion. We expect the reported sales will be down 1% to 3% due to the 2016 portfolio actions I mentioned. ","Let me move to Slide 9. As Darius mentioned, we\u2019re raising our low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to $6.90 to $7.10 up 7% to 10%, excluding divestitures. At a total Honeywell level we continue to anticipate delivering between 70 basis points and 110 basis points of margin expansion for the full year driven by slightly better performance in aerospace and PMT overcoming a slower start in HBT. ","Let me turn to Slide 10 for a brief wrap up. In summary, we delivered a high quality first quarter results with all of our segments contributing to the performance. Our end markets continue to improve across our businesses and our execution is getting better as well. We expect second quarter earnings to grow 7% to 10% year-over-year excluding divestitures and normalize for tax and we raised the low end of our full year EPS guide by $0.05. Our businesses continue to win and growing end markets, the investments we made in 2016 including the significant restructuring projects are also delivering for us and our Honeywell operating system is continuing to drive commercial gains and productivity improvements. We\u2019re well positioned to continue to outperform for the remainder of 2017. ","So with that, Mark let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are both now available to answer your questions. So, Dennis can we open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","If we can talk -- can you guys just remind us where we are with the European Solstice capacity adds. And when -- I know you\u2019ve been taking orders, but when do you really see the lion's share of that revenue ramp from -- maybe each one of those is a separate question, but I'd just leave it at that.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, so I would say that the biggest facility that we've been building for the last couple of year comes online at the end of Q2, early Q3, which is really the last portion of the capacity expansion. And as we saw starting early this year with the MAC initiatives kicking in in Europe we saw a nice volume ramp-up and our Solstice product line is up double digit so far this year and we expect that to continue and even accelerate further as we head into 2017 and further into '18 but. I think that the short answer here is that as we get into the second half of 2017 we're going to be exactly where we need to be from a capacity perspectives.","Tom Szlosek","And I would add, Scotts to that, that the orders are supporting that, I mean we had, as we mentioned double-digit orders growth in PMT overall, it was across all of the businesses, but especially in the once where we're making those capacity investments and the backlog is that it's picking up nicely.","Scott Davis","So help us just to understand, what kind of capacity utilization will you be at or how does that -- I mean are you profitable with those new orders in the first year or does it take until you get to a certain percent capacity utilization and just help us understand that and that'll be it from me? Thanks.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean I think remaining process start-up, I mean we are obviously not going to be operating at full capacity because and we had plans for that, and things are going to get ramped up. But I would say we're targeting well north of the 80% once we get into 2018 and beyond, and frankly we can bring even more capacity online as we secure new orders, we think that Solstice, we've done a really nice job securing orders and a lot of that is I would say our developed markets, but we see a lot of potential in our HGR markets as well given the acceptance of some of the, the payers outcome and we have some extra capacity that we can bring to bear to generate revenue and we also have plans for further expansions should some of those regulations be enacted, which we think that there is a very good chance that that will happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa ","So you guys did about $0.12 of kind of continuing ops improvement year-over-year in the first quarter. I think you had these OEM incentives and what were the OEM incentives in the first quarter I think you said 25 in the first half? Where were they in the first quarter? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, they were minor. The year-over-year impact was minor on OEM incentives in the first quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay, so that will be in effects, so that will be in the second quarter?","Darius Adamczyk","Second quarter you will see that.","Steve Tusa","Okay, when we look at kind of the second half of the year versus the first half of the year you are doing $0.12 year-over-year in these kind of core businesses in the first quarter of maybe it's a little bit less than that because of the OEM incentives in the second quarter although your guidance wouldn\u2019t suggest that. Just remind us is there anything in the second half other than the OEM incentives that makes the year-over-year comp tougher? Seems to me like the second half kind of dropped off a bit, so you have easier year-over-year comps there. Is there anything we should consider whether its mix or orders timing or anything like that or should that kind of -- $0.12 of whatever you do here in the first half actually be better in the second half of the year?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah I think the incentives, clearly as I said, a drag in the first half, a nice tailwind in the second half and that will continue into '18 and '19. We do get ramp up of repositioning in the second half. And then the we\u2019re continuing to integrate the acquisition, we\u2019re still actively integrating nine deals including the Intelligrated and those tends to get better as the year progresses in terms of operating margin improve when those synergies kick in. I\u2019d say those are the major impacts, first half and second half.","Steve Tusa","So, those are good guide from a run-rate perspective?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah. They should be helpful.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So, I think the, go ahead --.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I was just going to say Steve that we can\u2019t point to any specific headwinds other than frankly market uncertainty and although we're excited about frankly about the kind of a long-term orders performance we had in Q1. In most of our businesses is short cycle and the environment is probably fairly volatile, so we\u2019re being a little bit tempered of our expectations for the second half and given that it's kind of weak into the new role, we\u2019re being a little bit, I would say tempered around our expectations, but certainly excited about the kind of start we have here.","Steve Tusa","And I think -- yeah I would agree, I mean it looks like your guidance suggests really very minimal kind of run-rate improvement. So, a smart move only being in the seat for a few weeks. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next from Morgan Stanley, we\u2019ll hear from Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","So, just want to pick up on Steve's last question about the sort of how its having a start here and Darius you mentioned the environment is uneven volatile. Is that a reference to kind of what happened second half of last year 3Q very weak, 4Q came back and then 1Q back for raises [ph]. Is that what you're referring to or you're seeing inter quarter volatility during 1Q. And then on top of that, maybe you can just kind of color in sort of the what you're seeing today versus what you saw back in December when we put the plan together?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. No, the answer to the first part of your question. No, I actually had nothing to do with Q3 or Q4 last year and I would say overall and I think consistent with what I said at Investor Day, the environment in 2017 is better than 2016. I think we certainly see that in PMT, we see it in HBT, SPS and so on. I would also temper that, but it's not dramatically better, but its better, but not it's certainly not the kind of recovery.","In terms of comps versus December and how we deal today versus back then, I think maybe the only deal that that\u2019s a little bit different is that I think Dave sort of called it kind of the expectations around what's going to happen around tax reforms, they've been tempered a little bit as well, we continue to remain optimistic that things will happen, but I would say that there was almost clearly expectations and now I think there is a little more hesitancy, we have the elections in France coming up this weekend. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty in terms of the geopolitical environment at the moment. ","Nigel Coe","Yeah. for sure. And just to get into TS a little bit more detail, you referenced, Tom, that the commercial vehicle tails on highway and I'm assuming off highway to, and then as obviously we have a continued growth in penetration in gas, but then offsetting that we've got a little bit of LB production headwinds in the second half maybe even 2Q, and then diesel penetration Europe seems to be ticking down. So I'm just wondering how should we -- so to switch up together and thinking about the TS growth over the back half of the year?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and I think you've got all the factors laid out there Nigel, the overall global market will probably be flattish to up a little bit in terms of total production so when you look at the way we've modeled it out, I would say that the second quarter is not inconsistent with what you can expect for the rest of the year for TS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin ","Yes, so just the question on free cash flow, very impressive first quarter, can you just provide us was more insight as to what are the areas that you are looking for improvement what businesses you are targeting, what accounts and what should we see throughout the year?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, sure. First quarter for us the biggest driver as we've said was improved working capital performance. We saw that in particular in PMT and in Aerospace. But I think we're just, we're at the outset so that's going to be the major area focus for us in terms of driving improved free cash flow conversion. You've also got the CapEx and as you know we were at that peaks in 2016 and the 2017 that's starts to the moderators the investments that Darius is talking about earlier ramped down and we get into the full run mode, particularly in PMT and with the combination of those two things we expect to continue to drive that conversion higher.","Darius Adamczyk","And just to add and I would just emphasize the point that, working capital is -- so the renewed level of emphasis in all Honeywell your question around which businesses, I think all of them have an opportunity. We're driving receivable, inventory in all of these businesses, I think PMT particularly is [indiscernible] they did a really nice job in they receivables, a part of that is due to the recovery in the oil and gas markets, where some of our customers are recovering and they've made really, really nice progress in Q1 and by the way there is more to do. So I accept progress in all four of the SPGs going forward?","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question than on PMT. Great commentary on UOP, but a generally what are you guys seeing on a large project discussions and maybe outside of UOP and maybe you could just go around the world just to give us some colors as to what you are seeing?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean overall actually nice orders performance, high-single digit up for HPS. Teens, high-teens up for UOP, so we're seeing the order activity returning. I would characterize the order as kind of the medium size, so we didn\u2019t have the mega orders like we did in the last 12 to 18 months, which HPS has won. These will be kind of the medium sized, we actually didn't see the base business be as strong as we like it to. So this is being kind of the midsize order activities.","As we look at the region-by-region, South America continues to be relatively soft, the Middle East has had a nice comeback, China very, very strong performance in the first quarter, won lot of work there and that continues to come back also the U.S., especially in our GPNH business in UOP which is well correlated to the extent of the unconventional segment and as you see the rig count being up 80% in the US and much more than in Canada. We saw a very, very strong order activity in our GPNH business with the cryo-plants.","So, overall as the oil price stabilize here at 50, 50 plus and we\u2019re encouraged that some of the news we\u2019re hearing about the production freezes that OPAC is encouraging its members to do, I think that this is going to continue to be a tailwind for us for the rest of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Just a couple of things from me. I wondered if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what's going on with the Intelligrated? Obviously, I think we\u2019re all aware kind of e-commerce effect on retail and it's knock on effects to distribution. But really my question is, how much of the strength that you're seeing relates to Intelligrated now being part of Honeywell and you\u2019ve being able to open it up into other areas or should we think of this as a kind of truly organic Intelligrated as it stands now? And if the answer is, that\u2019s really just kind of this just legacy Intelligrated, maybe a little bit more color on the integration of the business and how you see the growth going forward?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. I think it's both Jeff, because for example one is the elements we're investing in heavily right now is, Intelligrated is predominantly is U.S. business, and we\u2019re globalizing that business, investing and let's say metricizing it and we see the international growth is a big opportunity for us in the future. That hasn\u2019t come through in the form big orders yet, but I can tell you that a lot of the big customers that we currently have in the U.S., they would want us to have a much broader global presence and we\u2019ve invested in that and we expect to materialize that.","In terms of overall business performance, I think I would describe that in one word, terrific. This business has substantially exceeding any financial metrics we\u2019ve had for it and continues to impress us of its rate of growth and we see strong double-digit growth rate both in revenue and bookings for this year and the more I learn about it, the more of the customers of this business I meet, the more excited I get. I think that we have a very exciting growth profile for this business both in terms of making it more global expanding our software solutions, expanding or playing robotics [ph] to a lot of different directions to go organically and potentially inorganically.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah. And the other thing I would add in terms of the Honeywell value is the -- those aftermarkets types of positioning, I mean the install base, we've mentioned 20% sales growth, this quarter backlog is up strongly in the double-digits. We\u2019re building a big install base there and that developing that aftermarket business model in addition to what Darius mentioned about the Europe it's going to be a nice driver for Intelligrated to grow.","Darius Adamczyk","And just maybe just one last thing to add and this is -- I've highlighted this before, but just to reinforce. The sweet spot of the Intelligrated business is ecommerce. It's high through, high speed package processing, which as you know is the segment it's growing in the fastest right now. So this is exactly in the sweet spot of where the big growth vector is at the moment. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just the separate unrelated question. On UOP can you just elaborate a little bit more on the licensing uptick you are seeing, what verticals is that and any color on what's going on in the refinery turnaround and chemical plant turnaround landscape? Thank you, that's it from me.","Darius Adamczyk","I would say the big uptick is in the petrochemical particularly in China is the place, I would point to, we've had a lot of recent success much larger integrated complexes and the combination of HPS and UOP is working very well, there are a number of wins there are in a very, very strong Q1 so as the economy grows so just the demand for the petrochemicals I would point to that as one of the highlights of the booking activity here in Q1 and certainly, China, India has been good but really strength across the globe. And even from activity returning in the Middle-East, which is really nice to see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray","Your four priorities that you laid out at the outlook, we're not expecting you to touch and check off every box, every quarter, but we did see the accelerated organic revenues. You got that expanding margins. You got that certainly more excitement and traction around it being a software industrial. Maybe not hearing much here this morning about more aggressive capital deployment. So maybe you can just touch on that. What kind of expectations do you want to set over the near term?","Darius Adamczyk","I think on cap deployment as I promised, that is one of the core initiatives. Frankly, we continue to be very active. The pipeline for M&A deals is very, very active. As but things are little bit expensive out there, so we are being cautious because as I point out on our Investor Day, we do want to be active and secure the right deals, but we also want to continue to be prudent buyers not over spend and that's frankly why maybe we haven\u2019t announced some of the -- any deals yet this year, but rest assured were very, very active. In terms of buybacks timing and we are committed to having the flat share count as we said and potentially to do even more later in the year. So timing is everything in that perspective.","So yes it seems a little bit quite but you got also to remember that I'm only about three weeks into the tole, so probably I'm pleased at some of the leverage actually coming through in our results in Q1.","Deane Dray","Got it, and then just as a follow-up. One of the goals that you've set is a new product Vitality index you expect to track to 20% in 2017 an uptick from last year. How did the first quarter play out?","Tom Szlosek","I think it's played out well, but in full transparency I would say most of our new product launches are backend loaded this year. We have some things coming out in Q3, Q3 will be a very, very new product launch quarter. So, I think in fairness, I'll have to be in a better position to answer that question, as we get deeper into the year, because right now it's really too early to tell and I don\u2019t want to declare a success until we see how some of the bigger even more exciting new product launches happen in Q2, and especially in Q3 which is going to be big launch quarter for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","I wanted to ask if you can characterize any of the channels that may have any destocking still going on. Previously you talked about SNPS, wondered if that\u2019s abated in, recently we heard some other aerospace companies talking about destocking on some of the aircraft programs, A7, 777, A380, et cetera. If you're seeing any of that or do you expect to? Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. I mean I think let me comment kind of SGS and I think we kind of see this continuation of destocking and frankly as some of our distribution partners are operating at lower inventory levels that what we\u2019ve historically have seen, that's certainly true in SPS. In Aero I'm not sure that we notice that is much, I think that\u2019s been fairly steady at least for us and that\u2019s exhibited by that the fact that frankly this performed a little bit better than we projected for Q1 and especially in the aftermarket segment for business which is been very, very strong and we\u2019re very pleased with the it. So I'm not sure that we\u2019ve seen that in Q1.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the M&A question from the earlier. Are you seeing any areas that are more promising than others that you could comment on, where valuations are perhaps more stretched versus more attractive, when looking at your [indiscernible]?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I guess unfortunately they are pretty stretch everywhere. The market is pretty warm right now, there is a lot of cash sitting around both on the private equity as well as strategic. I wouldn't say that anything is particularly cheap at the moment. Now, having said that we have very, very big pipeline and we have a lot of different options in terms of the segments that we\u2019re looking at, and I can tell you that we have attractive deals that we\u2019re looking through in every one of our SPGs. Now what actually lands and what happens we\u2019ll see. But I would say overall things are a bit expensive there is no question about that and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a comment that's end market specific, that\u2019s true really across our entire portfolio.","Operator","The next question we\u2019ll hear from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","So, Tom you mentioned interest this quarter on the organic growth side, it sounds like the -- it sounds like the order growth across a lot of your segments right now is going in the positive way. You've look at accounts for next quarter looks pretty easy I'm just trying to understand I guess the guidance, the flat to 2% organic growth guidance for 2Q. It just kind of seems like a layup based on the commentary and based on the comps. So maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful?","Tom Szlosek","Yes, that's fine Joe. We sort of had a sense that that would be a question. When you look at our businesses overall, our long-cycle is about 40%, short-cycle is about 60%. So were still in an environment on the short-cycle side where the demand patterns are not quite consistent, the word volatility was used before. I mean it's not exactly something that we have a good extended sight into on that short-cycle side.","But with that, if you look at it by each business, I mean Aerospace is more long-cycle oriented and the exception of the aftermarket, so fairly well grounded we did flat in Q1, we were calling minus 3 to minus 1 for Q2 and that's mostly OE related. You have those incentives coming through, as we mentioned that's at the bulk of the first half staff incentives hit us in that second quarter you've got regional and that's on the OE side that's been fairly weak and BGA continues to be kind of in that flattish range.","From an HPT perspective, short-cycle we're a little bit more cautious. So yes, we did 3% in Q1, we're calling 1% to 3% in Q2, let's see how that -- let's see how the demand patterns emerge over this quarter. I'd said the same thing for SPS, although there are a couple of other things going on there. So SPS was 3%, first quarter we're calling 0 to 2 in Q2, we've got a change in our go-to-market model on the retails side and we're going more direct to our customers and as a result there was some timing patterns in the channels. We also had as I mentioned, significant improvement in the first quarter and workloads solutions supply-chain. There was strong demand, but there was some unintended backlog at the end of the fourth quarter, we worked our way through and that helped Q1 specifically and SPS. So that's tempers a little bit.","But lastly on PMT, I think the -- it's fairly well grounded given the backlogs, so 5% in Q1, 3% to 5% in Q2, certainly Darius and I talked to Rajeev everyday about this, so we have the sort of the same expectation that we'll do a little bit better there, but we just want to be cautious on demand on some of the advance materials. It's been running like gang busters, as I said 150% improvement on the Solstice sale. I don\u2019t want to just bank on that every single quarter going forward.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and Joe, maybe just add a couple of comments. I think as you look at our long-cycle business and our backlog, we are fairly encouraged by what we saw, in Q1 backlog being up pretty much for every one of those businesses, and certainly there is a level of confidence in what we\u2019re seeing on the long-cycle.","The short-cycles is a slightly different story and we are positive on that short-cycle too, but if you think about kind of the animal spirits that we saw overall in the markets particularly in the U.S. and let's say in January versus what we see now, I would say that's a slight down arrow versus what it was and I think some of that could be reflected in the short-cycle and frankly we're being a little bit cautions and measured in terms of our outlook and we hope to deliver to the upside of what we stated.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That\u2019s an interesting observation on the bifurcation there. I guess the follow-up question I guess is maybe even slightly similar is really on the cash flow side. Seasonally incredibly strong, it didn\u2019t sound like you guys called out any onetime items this quarter. What's stopping you from potentially raising the cash flow guidance for the year?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. I mean -- so we\u2019re calling 5% to 7% growth in the -- for the full year guide, Joe. As you know the first quarter was 6x, first quarter is generally our most volatile quarter when it comes to cash. Now coupled that with these new initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place around working capital. You did see some significant uptake, I guess we want to see a sustained level of performance. Let's see where we are at the end of Q2 and let see whether we're really sticking with the working capital improvements that we\u2019ve seen. But I have a bias, like you do that that could get better as the year progresses.","Yeah. I think [indiscernible], I mean we need to see sustained performance, one quarter doesn\u2019t make the year and although we\u2019re very encourage by what we saw in Q1, I need to see it continued in Q2 and frankly if we see continued sustain performance at the end of Q2 we're going to revisit our guidance at the conclusion of the second quarter. ","Operator","And next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Howard Rubel","Two things, first maybe you could talk a little bit about the progress with connectivity. How many installs you have and sort of what kind of customer feedback that you are now getting with that business, is it becoming a little bit more prevalent in the marketplace?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. No, I think Howard, we're building out of organization. We saw a couple of key higher and Que Dallara and Steven Gold joined us in very senior leadership spot, we\u2019re building out our offerings and whether its connected aircraft where we\u2019ve had a number of wins that we highlighted in their report today, whether its connected homes, buildings, connected plant, sign up multiple partners. So, I'm not sure that we really measure it yet in terms of the number of connections we have, we measure it by the number of customer engagements we have, kind of interactions we have.","And frankly some of the connected enterprises are ahead of the others, I would classify connected aircraft, connect plant are a little bit further ahead and some of the other still a little bit more behind. But I can tell you that for all of them, we\u2019re at a stage where engaging customers we\u2019re optimizing our solutions and iterating, iterating quickly the way to grow this business is derive hypophysis, talk to customers, iterate and bring the value, because in many instances the customers don\u2019t know -- they can\u2019t define exactly what they\u2019re looking for.","So, we have a hypophysis that we optimize and optimize, but very, very big build out in this organization. So, we\u2019re -- whether it's our Atlanta software COE or some of the senior people that I pointed out, we\u2019re quickly building out our capabilities. But at the same time engaging customers there for revenue generation. And I can tell you that software business was, in total was up double digit in Q1.","Howard Rubel","I understand the challenge of doing that. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up in the other area on HPT you've called out the profitability was a little bit below what you might have expected in meet us well, and kind of the two-part question and as part of it mix and can you elaborate on that, and then from a strategic point of view we've seen a lot of what I'll call retail struggle a bit and that has in fact been the benefit of the ecommerce world. So can you talk about that structural dynamic and then also the near-term issue?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think Howard, you have it exactly right. I think the mix has been our biggest issue for Q1 in HPT both from a mix from a product versus distribution perspective, but also geographic perspective, where we saw tremendous rate of growth in some of the HGR regions, regions we've seen slightly less accretive versus some of the developed markets. So that was issue number one.","Now in terms of the retails versus transitioning to more ecommerce, I'm not sure that was really one of the cases, frankly our North America business was the little bit softer than we had expected. But HPT, when I pointed out earlier, when I answered the question around new product launches, there isn\u2019t a business out there that has more exciting product launches coming out in Q2 and Q3 and I expect that we're going to have a really, really nice strong second half of the year as well as a nice recovery here in Q2. ","Tom Szlosek","The other point I would add, Howard is that, in some of those -- some of the businesses that are growing faster than others, for example, as Darius mentioned the Americas region. When you have an OEM business, where we're providing parts and components to OEMs, that is growing quite strongly low to mid-single digit, the margins on the initial sale are not great, but we're building installed base. That's the business that we are in here. So creating an aftermarket opportunities. I think you are seeing a little bit of that in the Americas as well.","Operator","And our final question for today come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","I notice your comments on the several large smart meter project roll outs. Just wondering how much of that has developed since December and there are some complexion on how those came to fruition overall?","Darius Adamczyk","I mean some of them, certainly we secured those since December, overall, we were very bullish on this smart energy business for really the rest of the year. Those revenues tend to be maybe more lumpy than want to expect, we were kind of flattish in the first quarter, but I expect double digit growth in the second quarter and high single digit growth for the year, so we've been very successful in securing some of those larger wins. Really pleased with what we saw in terms of win activity in Q1. So overall very bullish on the Elster acquisition and what we're seeing in our smart energy business.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. And then the follow-up, just long-term pension income, kind of curious that if you could update the thought there? Its certainly a little bit arcane, if you could -- it's a nice income right now. What's kind of the long-term characteristic and sense of variability on how that P&L impact can swing overtime?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. As you know, I mean I like to simplify the model into two pieces, one is the assets and the other is the liability. The assets, you use the word archaic accounting model, I mean we just apply and assume return to the assets and that goes into our income. So as long as that assets pool that we have is performing and it has performed fairly well. You keep applying that same rate of income and you tend to grow your pension income. On the liability side, its interest rate related, so we're in a low interest rate environment and we apply that interest rate to the liability and that goes into our expense as well as one of our expense.","As that interest rate rises, you would see a decline in the pension income. But its -- it overall is the flat, but the important part for us is that the plans are in very good shape, they are well funded we\u2019re in the mid-90s or higher in most of our plans including the big one in the U.S. We don\u2019t foresee any contribution in the foreseeable future. So, it just becomes kind of the book keeping things for us as we go forward here.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter, especially our sales performance and overall execution. It was a clean quarter all around with every business either meeting or exceeding the top line guidance we provided.","However, there is more work to do, everyone in the organization is focus in our key priorities, improving organic growth, maintaining our productivity rigor and becoming a best in class software industrial company. We\u2019re going to continuously focus on outperforming for our customers, our shareholders and our employees and I look forward to sharing our continued success with you on futures calls. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day."],"10926":["Honeywell International Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you to your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Macaluso. Please go ahead, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you, Margaret. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings and 2019 outlook call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that, elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance and our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate, exclude the impact from separation costs related to the two spin-offs of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses as well as pension mark-to-market adjustment and U.S. tax legislation except where otherwise noted in 2018. With regards to 2019, references to adjusted free cash flow guidance and associated conversion on this call, exclude impacts from separation cost payments related to the spin-off.","This morning, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, share our guidance for the first quarter of 2019 and discuss our full year outlook. As always, we will leave time for your questions on the end.","With that, I will turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. We are extremely pleased with our results in 2018, made progress both from a portfolio and financial perspective, continued smart investments in our businesses and our people and took steps to position the company for next 20 years. This quarter, we successfully completed our second spin-off of the year, Resideo Technologies, launching our new stock exchange in October.","We also continue to advance our software spread toward growing our core businesses in attractive end markets. And most importantly, consistent with what we have done all year, Honeywell delivered on its commitments to our shareowners. We met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics, delivering adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 in the fourth quarter, driven by 6% organic sales growth and 80 basis points of segment margin expansion. We continue to see strength in our long cycle businesses, most notably in commercial aerospace, defense and warehouse automation, where Intelligrated business is a global leader. Furthermore, we are aggressively planning and mitigating the impacts of the tariffs dispute in all of our businesses as evidenced by the strong margin expansion we generated this quarter. Based on what we know of today, we do not expect any material impact to our results in 2019 related to tariffs.","For the full year, we achieved 100% free cash flow conversion and a 105% conversion in the fourth quarter. We generated over $6 billion of free cash flow for the year, excluding spin cost payments, up 22% even after spinning nearly 20% of the company in the fourth quarter. This was principally driven by profitable growth, higher net income and continued efforts to free up working capital, all the while funding smart growth investments through $800 million of CapEx. Our free cash flow as a percent of sales is the highest it\u2019s been in at least 15 years and we expect to continue to grow from here. Importantly, our U.S. pension is funded over 105% and we do not expect any cash contributions in near-term. The financial health of this company heading into 2019 is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and we still have ample resources to deploy.","Lastly we continued a steady cadence of capital deployment of an additional $1.7 billion of Honeywell share repurchases in the quarter bringing the full year total to approximately $4 billion. As a result and now expect the fully diluted share count to be down at least 3% in 2019 based on our plan to reduce share count by at least 1% from 2018. As we continue return cash to our share owners through $2.3 billion in dividend following another double digit dividend increase in 2018. This was a particularly good year for Honeywell. We have a simpler, more focused portfolio after dispense and continue to execute on our initiatives as we look to the future. We see strength across several end markets and have significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. And while we are not planning for recession in 2019, we are taking steps now to ensure deliver on our commitment in an uncertain economic environment.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 to review some of the progress from last year. As I mentioned we took significant steps through 2018 to transform the business. One of my key priorities from the outset was to accelerate organic growth. As we have seen by our results we are making good progress on this front. We were encouraged by the fact that nearly 60% of the portfolio grew just 5% or more organically for the full year of 2018 with several businesses growing about 10%. If the spin offs complete we now operate our more focused portfolio in our smaller number of attractive end markets. Portfolio optimization is central to and will continue to be part of Honeywell\u2019s operating system. We plan to continue effectively deploying capital by funding high return CapEx and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have had nine consecutive double digit dividend increases since 2010 and still have a strong and flexible balance sheet the ability to deploy over $14 billion of cash to M&A, CapEx, dividends and share repurchases. The combination of strong sales growth, favorable end market exposure and significant balance sheet capacity positioned us well as we head into 2019.","We are now on Slide 4, as I mentioned continuous transformation is part of Honeywell\u2019s operating system. On this slide we highlighted three key transformation initiatives to establish Honeywell as a premier technology company for the future. Earlier in this year we established Honeywell Connected Enterprise or HCE which is a strengthened and centralized organization that will serve as the softer innovation engine for all of Honeywell. HCE operates with speed and agility of a startup working close to our businesses and our customers across the entire portfolio to build the world\u2019s best software solutions rapidly and efficiently on the single platform. Our transformation to a premier technology company require us to look beyond just spin offs. Our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Torsten Pilz is leading Honeywell\u2019s efforts to improve our supply chain and optimize our global footprint. We are seeing a lot of opportunity here to drive margin expansion and operational efficiency and you\u2019ll hear much more about this from Torsten at annual investor conference in May.","We are making similar enhancements on our capabilities internally with Honeywell\u2019s digital initiative. This requires people, process, data and technology elements to come together which will allow for more effective and efficient decision making throughout Honeywell. This effort includes a continuation of our progress to centralized ERP systems. Thus far we have eliminated 35 unique systems in 2018 growing from 106 through 71 and we are path to just 10 ERP applications by the end of 2020. The result will be consistent processes and centralized data coverage of a common IT foundation. As you can see we have achieved a lot this year and continued to redefine the limits on what Honeywell can achieve to be the best positioned multi-industrial company for the future.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 to briefly review progress against our key priorities. I laid out my key priorities for the company in 2017, since then we have continued to foster our culture win Honeywell of doing what we say, however, as we called the say do ratio. As you stack the results against our long-term commitments, you can see we are clearly making progress and in some instances achieving milestones sooner than we thought such as of our organic sales growth and free cash flow conversion. We are accomplishing these objectives while making smart investments for future through CapEx, restructuring and research and development. Our software businesses grew in the mid-teens range last year on a path to the 20% long-term compound annual growth rate we anticipate. We have taken steps to unify and strengthen our software strategy through the Honeywell Connected Enterprise and continue to invest in software development, sales and marketing capabilities and build-out of the Sentience platform.","In 2018, Honeywell Ventures made 5 investments, including in Soft Robotics, a developer of automation solutions and soft robotic gripping systems that can grasp and manipulate items, the same dexterity of the human hand and in IoTium, a managed secured network infrastructure platform for an industrial Internet of Things that primarily serves building technologies and industrial customers. We also completed two bolt-on acquisitions totaling roughly $500 million. Ortloff Engineers is a privately held licensor and industry leading developer of specialized technologies to drive high returns in natural gas processing and sulphur recovery. This complements our existing UOP offering, which allows us to better meet customer needs for high recovery, non-gas liquid extraction plants growth.","Transnorm, now part of safety and productivity solutions is a global leader in high-performance conveyor solutions that are used in diverse end-markets, such as parcel delivery, e-commerce fulfillment and airports. The acquisition strengthens Honeywell\u2019s warehouse automation portfolio and positions the company to support the growing European e-commerce market, while broadening Honeywell\u2019s connected distribution center and aftermarket offerings.","I will stop there and turn the call over to Greg who will discuss our fourth quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Darius and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Slide 6. As Darius mentioned, we finished 2018 very strong in every financial metric. Organic sales growth for the fourth quarter was 6%. We have been at or above 5% every quarter this year. This reflects our continued commitment to customer excellence, new product development as well as our realization of benefits from the investments we have made in our sales organization and new product development process.","We generated approximately $2 billion of segment profit in the fourth quarter driven principally by higher sales volumes, with segment margin expansion of 80 basis points. The impact in the spin-offs of lower margin businesses, net of acquisitions contributed 30 basis points, while the core business generated 50 basis points expansion. Pricing and productivity was strong which enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact of material and labor inflation. We also saw continued benefits from previously funded restructuring. Adjusted EPS was $1.91, up 12% versus prior year excluding the spins, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $0.01. The adjusted EPS figure, excludes both the impact of an approximate $435 million, favorable adjustment to the 4Q \u201817 tax charge and $104 million in spin related separation costs.","At the outlook call in 2018, we estimated a separation cost for the two transactions would be in the range of $800 million to $1.2 billion. I am very pleased to report that the total separation cost for both spins came in lower than this estimate at $730 million, which demonstrates our ability to effectively execute complex transactions both ahead of schedule and below budget. We also recorded $300 million in repositioning charges in the quarter to fund future productivity and stranded cost reductions. Share buybacks totaled $4 billion in 2018 and drove a $0.06 benefit from lower share count in the quarter. You can find a bridge to the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share in the appendix of this presentation. Finally, working capital improved 0.6 turns year-over-year. Our businesses are all focused on improving working capital and we continue to see progress on our initiatives with room to free up more cash for capital deployment.","Now, on to Slide 7 and review our segment results. Our aerospace business continued to perform extremely well in a robust demand environment, capping off a strong year of near double-digit organic sales growth. In the fourth quarter, we generated 17% organic growth in defense and space, with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international businesses led by global demand for sensors and guidance systems, original equipment shipment volumes and higher spares volumes on U.S. Department of Defense programs. We also saw growth in our space business driven by new satellite program wins and commercial helicopters driven by repair and overhaul demand. In commercial OE, sales were up 8% organically, with increased HTS engine demand for Gulfstream and Textron Longitude platforms and higher aviation ship set volumes driven primarily by the certification of the Gulfstream G600. Aftermarket growth was strong in all businesses, including defense driven by increased demand for avionics upgrades both software and hardware, navigation products and safety mandates. Our connected aircraft offering has continued to gain traction driven by GoDirect cabin tail capture on robust JetWave demand.","Turning to Honeywell Building Technologies organic sales growth was 1% driven by continued demand for commercial fire products in North America, Europe and our high growth regions. Building Solutions projects growth was also strong particularly for international airports. The HBS projects backlog is up 15% setting up a strong 2019 as we continue to expand in the critical infrastructure markets like airports, cities and stadiums. These gains were offset by declines in our China air and water business and temporary supply chain challenges within our building management systems business. We expect the air and water business to recover in 2019 driven by new product introductions for the mid segment and stronger demand as inventory net levels normalize after a challenging 2018. In December the supply chain issues within building management systems began to stabilize and we expect continued improvement in the first half of 2019. HBT also benefited from one month of single digital organic sales growth from the former homes business driven by strength in both products and ADI global distribution. As a reminder the results for HBT exclude homes and distribution after October.","In performance materials and technology sales were flat on an organic basis. Sales in UOP were up 2% driven by ongoing strength in licensing and engineering sales, but were offset by an expected decline gas processing which was driven by an extremely strong fourth quarter in 2017. Process solution sales were up 1% organically driven primarily by a strong demand in our software maintenance and migration services and steel devices. This was offset by declines in large project activity and in smart energy and thermal solutions both shorter cycle businesses due to supply chain challenges. Notably we continue to see solid trends within the automation businesses and process solutions with total orders up double digits and short cycle backlog up over 30% suggesting that oil price volatility in the fourth quarter may have temporarily delayed customer investment decisions.","Advanced material sales were down 3% on an organic basis as continued strong demand and adoption of our solstice line of low global warming refrigerants which was up 5% was offset by declines in specialty products particularly in our electronic materials business which is in the semiconductor space as you know and tough comps associated to the fourth quarter of 2017. PMT segment margins expanded 200 basis points in the fourth quarter as expected driven by the timing of catalyst shipments within UOP, commercial excellence and the benefits from previously funded repositioning.","Now turning to the safety and productivity solutions business that continued to perform at a high level with organic sales up 15%, driven by broad based strength across all lines of business, double-digit organic growth in Intelligrated continued as orders from major systems and robust backlog conversion fueled by e-commerce drove strong results. We also saw double digit growth in our sensing business and continued strength in our productivity products business driven by demand for android based mobility offerings and handheld printing devices. In total organic in our productivity solutions segment was up 23%. Moving to safety, the safety business sales grew 5% organically led by ongoing demand for gas products and strong growth in retail footwear associated with the holiday season.","Finally, we continue to see strength in our business is across high growth regions. In China SPS grew double digits with robust growth across industrial safety, productivity products and SIoT. Excluding the ongoing softness in air and water, HBT also grew double digits in China, for all of Honeywell China was up 9% organically for the full year. In India our capabilities and strength provided exceptional growth in the fourth quarter greater than 25% over prior year. This was driven by our building and process solutions business. We continue to see positive macroeconomic trends in the Middle East which supported growth across all businesses with three segment growing double digits organically compared to the prior quarter.","Now with 2018 in the rear-view mirror, let\u2019s move to Slide 8 and discuss our 2019 outlook. We have a reliable play book in Honeywell and it\u2019s not changing for 2019. Our focus on smart growth investments, break through initiatives and new product development coupled with productivity rigor and the benefits of funded repositioning has positioned us well for continued out performance. For 2019 we anticipate an organic sales growth range of 2% to 5%, the low end of which reflects the possibility of some economic slowing but not a recession in 2019.","Segment margin expansion is expected to be 110 to 140 basis points or 30 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of the spin-offs. This will drive earnings per share growth of 6% to 10% excluding dilution from the spins in 2018. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow conversion near 100% consistent with 2018 driven by high-quality income growth and continued working capital improvements across the portfolio. We are confident in our businesses in the year ahead supported by positive long cycle orders and backlog trends exiting 2018.","We have put forth a strong plan with multiple cost levers to pull in the event the recent volatility in the macro environment persists. As Darius mentioned in his opening, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact in 2019 related to tariffs. We have worked very hard to mitigate that across the year for 2019, including addressing the potential impact of the still unannounced List 4, which contemplates 25% tariff on all remaining items imported from China. We will continue to monitor this throughout the year and react accordingly as we did in 2018.","Some other items to take note of related to our 2019 plan. We are on track to slightly ahead of our plan to eliminate all stranded costs in 2019 related to the spin-offs with a little over half the costs removed to-date. We see the impact of these costs primarily in the net corporate cost line and in the segment margin in Honeywell Building Technologies. Also based on the planned reduction in pension income driven by discount rates and assumed asset returns as well as lower repositioning and other charges driven by the spin indemnity, our total net below the line charges are expected to be approximately $80 million in 2019. We will see continued benefits from planned and executed share repurchases. Our 2019 plan assumes a weighted average share count reduction of about 3% year-on-year or 730 million shares. This is based on the 2% share count reduction we executed from 2018 repurchases and at least 1% additional reduction in 2019. You will find additional details on our 2019 plan inputs in the appendix. Based on what we can see today, we expect to be at the upper end of our sales guidance range for organic growth. However, given the many uncertainties in the macro signals, we are planning cautiously in 2019 overall as its difficult to predict short cycle revenues, particularly in the second half of the year and remember that is still approximately 60% of our business.","Let\u2019s turn to Page 9, we have provided initial assessment of our end markets and anticipated organic growth rates in each for 2019. The green arrows are an indication that we expect market conditions to improve, while the gray flat arrows indicate that we expect market conditions to remain relatively similar to last year. Starting with aerospace, we expect organic sales to be up strong mid single-digits for the year. We continue to see a robust demand environment in both commercial aerospace and defense. And in transport, we expect continued growth in narrow-body production rates. We forecast new business jet deliveries to increase 8% to 10% in 2019 supported by several new aircraft models entering into service, a decline in young used aircraft inventories and stable used jet prices.","Our long-term strategy of securing good positions on the right platforms and building our installed base will serve us well in 2019, particularly with new business jet platforms, where we are well positioned from an OE standpoint. Mid single-digit flight hours growth will continue to drive aftermarket demand and we expect further tailwinds from the ADS-B compliance mandate deadline, along with increased demand for connected aircraft solutions across all products. The industry dynamics in defense will be positive in the U.S. and internationally driven by budget growth, but we are planning conservatively for 2019 given the tough year-over-year comparisons following 2018\u2019s banner year where we grew 15% organically in the business. With the favorable margin rate uplift from the former Transportation Systems spin, you should expect segment margins of approximately 24% for the aero business going forward.","Now on to HBT, as a reminder, following the spin of our homes portfolio, HBT\u2019s primary exposure is to non-residential construction. Here we anticipate low single-digit organic sales growth after a challenging 2018 driven by better execution in our operations, better selling strategies and sales coverage and new product introductions. We expect commercial fire will continue to be strong with the expansion of sales coverage and share gain and commercial security to improve with the expansion of our channel partner network. The declines we experienced in our China-based air and water business should subside through a combination of stronger market demand and new product introductions for the mid segment and mass mid segment.","Globally, we see building management solutions growth in both hardware and software driven by high growth regions expansion and our investments in software. Honeywell building solutions growth will be driven by government investments in smart cities, social infrastructure and airport monetization and capacity enhancements, particularly in high growth regions. We also expect continued adoption of connected building solutions on a global basis. You should expect to see margins in the range of about 20.5% in HBT after the spin off of homes.","For PMT sales were expected to be up low single-digits plus on an organic basis. In oil and gas petrochemical market growth should remain steady at about 4% driven by demand for packaging and plastics. However, given the volatility in oil prices in the second half of 2018, investments in global mega projects slowed and we see the oil price volatility potentially putting some pressure on upstream spending plans in 2019. Nevertheless, we anticipate similar market dynamics overall for 2018 and the basis for our plan is that oil prices remain in the low to mid-60 per barrel. The refining market should continue to be strong as global demand for cleaner transportation fuels remains. The U.S. natural gas market which is primarily served by our UOP Russell business is expected to improve in 2018. UOP is expected to deliver a strong year driven by its strong backlog, licensing and services growth and improved market demand in gas processing after a tough 2018.","Process solutions will continue to grow across its short cycle businesses as we saw in 2018. This is supported by short cycle backlog which was up over 30% at the year end. Finally, within advanced materials we expect continued growth from solstice and our flooring products and better execution in specialty products. Lastly in SPS, sales were expected to be up in the mid single-digit range. We expect a strong ecommerce and warehouse distribution macro trends to continue as our customers seek and implement differentiated warehouse solutions to deal with rising demand. Our orders in Intelligrated in 2018 were up over 30% for the year. In the safety business, we anticipate growth to be driven by new product introductions within gas protection, growth in our core product lines and high risk personal protective equipment and new product launches in general safety. In productivity we expect strong growth driven by backlog conversion in Intelligrated and our sensing business, new mobility product introductions and expanded software offerings. We are also seeing growth in our life cycle service offerings and Intelligrated which includes maintenance, technical support and optimization services. That is combined with the aftermarket capabilities we acquired with Transnorm.","Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 10, here you can see the bridge of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to 2019. The spin impact which we define as the after tax segment profit contribution from the spins in 2018, nine months of transportation systems and 10 months of homes, net of the estimated impact of the spin indemnity assuming that it was in place all year for 2018 will be a $0.62 headwinds earnings in 2019. As you can see the majority of our earnings improvement $0.30 to $0.60 per share will again come from operational gains in our businesses, driven by profitable growth, continued productivity improvements and incremental benefits from previously funded restructuring. You can see the remaining impacts from the share count below the line items and tax rate I have already touched on will contribute approximately $0.11 per share.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 11 to discuss our first quarter guidance. For the first quarter we expect to generate 3% to 5% organic sales growth driven principally by healthy growth in our long cycle businesses with a more cautious tone towards short cycle given the market volatility exiting 2018. With that said we do anticipate that the commercial aftermarket our sensing business and productivity products and commercial fire products will continue to be strong on the short cycle side. We expect segment margins will expand 30 basis points to 60 basis points ex the spins, consistent with our long-term framework and 110 basis points to 140 basis points on a reported basis aided by 80 basis points of margin accretion from the absence of the two spends. Our expected adjusted earnings per share range of $1.80 to $1.85 represents growth of 6% to 9% expense. We have $0.25 of earning solutions and the spins in the first quarter of 2018. Our guide is based on an effective tax rate of 22% and weighted average share count of 737 million shares for the quarter. We feel this will be a very strong start to another successful year for Honeywell in 2019.","With that I would like to turn the call back to the Darius who will wrap on Slide 12.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Greg. We accomplished a lot in 2018 and expect great things in 2019 as well. We delivered on all our commitments, successfully completed spin offs ahead of schedule and under budget, while still overdriving on the organic growth, margin expansion, earnings per share and free cash flow targets that we have established at the end of 2017. There is significant room for continued margin expansion on the path to our long-term target of 23%. This is aided by over $450 million of repositioned fund in 2018 and in prior years which will drive improvements to our cost structure, supply chain and gross margin in 2019 and beyond.","Our balance sheet capacity is strong and this will provide another lever to drive outperformance in any macro environment. They are continuing their business transformation through several new initiatives, including Honeywell Digital, a unified software business in Honeywell Connected Enterprise and increased focus on our supply chain. We are excited about 2019 and expect another great year.","With that, Mark, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions, if possible please keep your questions to one comment and a quick follow-up, so we can address all questions. Marguerite, if you could please open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We can now take our first question from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Darius and Greg.","Greg Lewis","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Nice way to finish up 2018. Darius, I guess on aerospace, just really the momentum continues to be really impressive with organic growth of 10% in each of the past two quarters. Maybe you can talk about I guess the sustainability of the confidence around the biz jet volume for you. I know you mentioned 8% to 10% for this year. And on the 2019 aerospace guidance of mid single-digit plus, is the defense tough comp really the only headwind you are seeing in 2019, maybe just some color there? Thanks.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, so first of all, we are very confident about our aero outlook for 2019. Our bookings have been strong, January has been strong. Yes, the comps do get tougher and there is still some short cycle. And I think as people saw in our outlook for Q1 and what I anticipate will be Q2, we have every bit of confidence that mid single-digit is hopefully the bottom, but the fact is we don\u2019t know the second half of the year and that\u2019s why the numbers are what they are and potential government shutdowns and budgetary challenges and trade licenses potentially becoming an issue. We hope that doesn\u2019t happen, that just reflects sort of external risk. But overall, there is absolutely nothing that I am concerned about in terms of the bookings to growth rates to kind of growth we are seeing in that business and it\u2019s pervasive across all three segments, whether they are transport, bga or defense and space. So I am very pleased and it\u2019s not a place where I am going to be losing a lot of sleep in 2019.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color. Thanks. I will leave it to one.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks.","Greg Lewis","Thanks Peter.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you and good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Sheila.","Greg Lewis","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Across your four businesses you either have a deceleration in organic growth or flattening of sales growth, just where are you factoring in some conservatism with a slowdown and how are you capturing that low end of the sales growth guidance of 2%?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think it\u2019s not so much that I am \u2013 we are capturing any conservatism in any of the businesses. I think what we have in our guidance going forward is the fact that more than 50% of our business is short cycle. And what\u2019s different about this year than I think many years in the past is we have many more unknowns, whether it\u2019s Brexit, whether it\u2019s trade negotiations, specific China U.S. whether it\u2019s Fed hikes in terms of what happens, whether it\u2019s government shutdowns or just a lot of geopolitical unknowns more than usual. And for us, to express a level of confidence around all these unknowns around a little bit wider range than we anticipated, I think would probably indicate a level of knowledge that we currently don\u2019t have. Now having said that and as you can see in our Q1 outlook, we are actually front-end loaded. And if anything, we are going to be at the upper half of our revenue growth range in the first half of the year. So actually, we provided that all things go as we think they will to deposit side, I think that hopefully we will be raising the bottom of that range as we move further through the year. But there is I don\u2019t see really any growth issues of any of our businesses and we expect all of them to grow in 2019.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you for the color.","Operator","We can now take our next question from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning John.","Greg Lewis","Good morning John.","John Inch","Good morning guys. So how did your European businesses do and what\u2019s actually baked I guess on the growth rate any color there and what\u2019s baked into your guidance for 2019 for Europe?","Greg Lewis","Yes. John, Europe continued to be strong. In the fourth quarter, our European businesses were up 6% which capped off of 4% organic growth for the year. So I still think we are seeing good strong growth there and it\u2019s a pretty broad based, to be honest SPS probably the strongest of the bunch, but each of the businesses is growing in the mid single-digits or higher in Europe at this stage. And as we look forward we expect that\u2019s probably going to be still low mid single-digits \u2013 low to mid single-digits. But as Darius mentioned clearly they are concerns out there, I mean Brexit in particular will have some sort of an answer in the next 60 days is what occurs with that and we have got a meaningful size business in the UK. So definitely back to the concern aspects of macro signals, Europe is an area where we are waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen with Brexit in particular and what impacts that may have on us.","John Inch","But Greg, that performance, the 6% that\u2019s pretty good relative to what other companies have been putting up in Europe and given sort of the slowing in Germany itself, is there a mix issue that\u2019s benefiting Honeywell or new products or what do you think is attributable to why you are doing\u2026?","Greg Lewis","Well, again I would tell you that each of the businesses is performing well. So it\u2019s not like one is I mean SPS being the strongest of the bunch, but each of them is up mid single-digits for the year. So it\u2019s the strength across our entire portfolio.","John Inch","And then as a follow-up last year you guys put up 3% to 5% core growth target and Darius you flagged accelerating core growth as your number one priority, now I understand the economics and sensitivity is around the 2 to 5 this year, but I am just trying to think big picture what are you and how are you actually going to tackle driving Honeywell towards more of a mid single-digit type of accelerating core growth over time, is that meaning to go after like in Darius that pie, the 40% that\u2019s not growing at 5% plus or do you kick start building technologies which has been sort of a problem for a little while or more M&A I mean what maybe just walk us through a little bit of your own thoughts and maybe horizon too?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. John, it\u2019s any one thing, it\u2019s probably all of those, I mean it starts with portfolio and we think that bases upon what we have done here. We have got more growth oriented and less cyclical portfolio that\u2019s certainly part of it. Secondly, which is our tremendous focus on lastly product development and we are launching the whole new process called Z21 which basically is going to reduce our innovations cycle times in half, deploying more capital to R&D because my strong belief is that part of any growth story is got to be a strong innovation engine and that\u2019s something that we are trying to create. Continued focus on high growth regions, I mean we are winning in places like China and India. And even though the back half of the year China was a little bit slower or we grew nearly double digit in China this year, so that continues to be our success story. Our focus on commercial excellence from our sales force is working where we are getting better productivity out of sales force, better performance. It\u2019s never only one thing. We are working all those levers. And as you can see in the growth rate that we have demonstrated this is granted, the markets are pretty good, but certainly involve the self-help that we have administered over the last couple of years. There is now way we would be in that range both in 2018 and what we are projecting for 2019.","John Inch","Just lastly, India has been a real success story, I think you flied it again, would you consider putting more resources or doing M&A in India in particular and region wise it\u2019s much smaller than China, but it does seem to have gained a lot of traction for Honeywell, I am just wondering I am thinking about it?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. We have had a lot of focus on India. I mean to give you a perspective for India, our growth in India in Q4 was 27%, so that\u2019s tremendous. We have a big footprint there not just from our business perspective, we have our engineering centers there over 10,000 people. So, we feel very comfortable of our presence there. The opportunities now to go after the mass mid-market segment and that\u2019s actually one of our core initiatives for 2019 and beyond. It\u2019s just not to play in the top tier, the mid tier, but actually having a greater level of participation in mid-market segment. So India is definitely one of the economies, which we think is going to be a great story for us in 2019 and beyond.","John Inch","Thanks very much.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, John.","Operator","We now take our next question from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks. Good morning and great results.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Good morning and thank you.","Gautam Khanna","Two questions. First, just big picture M&A pipeline, what can you say about it? Is it as healthy as it\u2019s ever been or anything large that you guys are looking at, just any commentary on the nature of the pipeline right now?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I would say large probably not, because I think that we are still very much focused on bolt-ons and not the mega deals. So, I would say that is and will continue to be our focus. We got a deal done in Q4, which was good. Now, Transnorm was a deal of size, the kind of size we like, it was about $0.5 billion to capital to want to do that. But to be honest, on my commentary, that the pipeline continues to be good and we are working on the deal that recently fell through just because although there has been a little bit of a correction in the market as we saw particularly in December that didn\u2019t really change expectations of lots of sellers. So we continue to struggle valuations and the expectations, which there is a very pronounced shift up and it\u2019s got to work in our financial model. So we continue to be very active. The pipeline is good, but I also want to tell you that we are realistic, because we are cautious buyers and we don\u2019t like to overpay. So we have to be certain about what we are buying and make sure that generates the right level of returns for our shareowners.","Gautam Khanna","Appreciate it. And second question was just if there are any supplier constraints you are seeing on the aerospace side, I remember last year you had some aftermarket constraints, are you seeing any pinch points emerge?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, no. The answer to that is yes. And I would say, there are some pinch points on the supply chain emerging not just in aerospace, those are there and prevalent, particularly in areas like casting etcetera, but we see similar challenge in smart energy and even in some elements of electronic supply chain. So, the pinch points on the supply chain are real. They are there. We are working through those and hope to resolve those. Frankly speaking, our results could have been even better, had some of those pinch points not been there.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks a lot, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Sure.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Maybe just a first question around SPS, you grew around 10% plus organically in 2018. Your Slide 9 shows about mid single-digit growth this year amidst to sort of accelerating market arrow. So, is that guidance based on anything you are seeing in the short cycle businesses within SPS or it\u2019s simply about tough comps and the usual macro aspects that you had mentioned earlier?","Greg Lewis","Yes. Thanks, Julian. I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, obviously, we continue to be very excited about Intelligrated and the double-digit growth rates that we achieved this year and with a very strong backlog expect that to continue to be strong. We did \u2013 our retail business though not large grew over 20% in 2018. So that\u2019s probably going to dampen a bit with some of those comps. We still feel very positive about productivity products and sensing and IoT with the new product introductions that they have, but those and the industrial safety businesses, they are short cycle. And when those things change they can change quickly. And so I think that\u2019s where we are trying to be a bit cautious, because we have seen it, we have seen it happen before in terms of the speed at which the short cycle can turn on us. And so it\u2019s not a matter of having seen it so far and being concerned about anything with our business specifically, but I would just call it a bit more caution with the environment we are in.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, just to add to that, Julian, like Greg said, I mean, majority of that business is actually short cycle. Intelligrated is about the only business that isn\u2019t short cycle. So based on what we are seeing now and today and our guides for Q1, there is no warning signs for us here where we are positioned is just uncertainty, particularly on the second half of the year.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then my second question around PMT, anymore color you would like to provide on how you see the cadence of the large project activity within HPS in terms of the scale of any delays? And also UOP, how you are gauging the volatility there at the moment?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. No, I like the greater stability. What we saw in Q4 a little bit was a bit of a pause on the order rates just around the volatility of oil, but kind of given the right direction movement, we are much more bullish. But despite that, I just want to quote you a couple of numbers from Q4 and why I am bullish on PMT for this year. First of all, our HPS quarter rates were up double-digit. Second of all, our UOP backlog is up 8%. So I am very optimistic around PMT performance for 2019 probably the one segment that was pretty soft was in our advanced materials business, the electronics chemicals, which electronics has been a bit weaker, some of the other companies in that segment announcing and we saw that in our electronics chemicals business. So that\u2019s probably the only sort of minus that we saw in Q4, but overall, book to backlog, the order rates were good. And to be honest, especially in HPS, our global mega projects log and quote are really strong we even book a lot of those orders in Q4. And our orders growth was up double-digit in the quarter. So, I feel pretty good about the PMT for 2019.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Julian.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.","Greg Lewis","My pleasure.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just wanted to ask about the not \u2013 we are not sensitive or anything like that. You mentioned kind of the next phase of the transformation and some of the footprint stuff that you are looking into. Is that something that you will be able to kind of quantify more and speak to at this year\u2019s Investor day or is that going to remain \u2013 I don\u2019t know what you put at the bottom of the slide like you are consulting with people or something like that about what the number is going to be? When we kind of hear more about that and how big could that opportunity be?","Darius Adamczyk","We are not putting you in the middle anymore on the call. You wind up grump, Steve. No, the \u2013 so, the short answer is yes on Investor Day, we are going to \u2013 it\u2019s obviously going to be a segment of that presentation. We are going to give you a lot more detail, but I just want to be very clear that the next phase of the transformation is not just the ISC transformation. That\u2019s a very big part of it, but we kind of talked a little bit about this deck about kind of the three legs of the stool, which are ISC transformation, Honeywell Digital and Honeywell Connected Enterprises, that\u2019s sort of the next phase of the evolution of Honeywell. And one of those three is a business and the next two are going to be \u2013 are going for at least the next 3 to 4 years. So this is going to give us a lot more tailwinds in terms of margins, cash generation, more efficiency working capital, simplifications, better planning, lower capital intensity a lot of benefits. So we are going to provide a lot more color on that at our Investor Day.","Steve Tusa","Are you going to give something \u2013 are you going to give something tangible or will it be kind of like directional arrows? I mean, sometimes the stuff can, it sounds great, but ultimately, it doesn\u2019t like filter down at the bottom line for other companies. Just curious if you are going to like give something tangible, numbers wise?","Greg Lewis","So Steve, I mean, oftentimes, we get asked about how long of a runway do we have for margin expansion. And to me, this is continuing to fill the portfolio of things that keeps that runway alive and well. And so that\u2019s kind of the way I am thinking about all of these things are going to continue to contribute to our ability to drive that margin expansion well beyond 2019.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Darius Adamczyk","Because as we kind of get deeper and deeper into the 20s which we are very comfortable that we are going to do and you look at our framework that we present in 2017, I talked about 30 to 50 basis point expansion as you see from our performance as well as our guide, and the top end of the range, it\u2019s even greater than that number these are the kinds of things that enable us to kind of keep growing that margin machine is self-help and these internal initiatives and the good news is, we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities, because we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on the supply chain and Honeywell Digital so I view all of that as not bad news, but really a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive margins.","Steve Tusa","And then one last one, I know you guys don\u2019t want to give specific segment guidance but maybe can you just talk about who maybe above or below the averages when it comes to margin expansion for 2019, just so people are kind of calibrated, sometimes the segments can move around a little bit and people tend to kind of pick what they want to look at as positives or negatives, things that\u2019s good to kind of baseline people don\u2019t need exact numbers, but just some directional color around what will be above or below that kind of margin expansion or whether they\u2019re all be kind of in the middle there? That\u2019d be helpful.","Greg Lewis","Yes, I would expect Aero and HBT to probably lead the pack in terms of the rate of expansion in \u201919 but each of the segments will have a very respectable margin expansion profile but clearly with the rate of growth that we\u2019re seeing in Aero and leveraging the fixed costs that we have there, that\u2019s probably got a pretty sizable opportunity and again HBT, with a return to growth and some new products, we see that is also having a fair amount of opportunity but each of the businesses, I think will expand margins in a meaningful way in \u201819.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We can now take our next question Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Jeff.","Greg Lewis","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of things on maybe some of the longer cycle outlooks and the like first on Intelligrated, obviously, I have great visibility now on \u201819 on this backlog, but do you have visibility on things like front-log, bidding etcetera. do you expect it to be a fairly active order year again in 2019 for Intelligrated?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, the short answer is absolutely, because not only, because of the continued strength of activity in North America, which is continues to be robust but now, the Transnorm and our enhanced capability in Europe both from the beachhead that we\u2019ve established by acquiring Transnorm, but also because if you recall, we put a lot of investments back in the \u201817 and \u201818 timeframe for R&D capability, we have a metrics-based offering that\u2019s complete now so we\u2019re very capable bidding on warehouses, etcetera. so we continue to expect another very robust year in our Intelligrated business.","Jeff Sprague","And then I was also just wondering back to these mega-projects question in HPS, you noted your orders were strong, even without some of those kind of hitting the order book we think a lot of those projects kind of being underwritten that maybe $50 or $60 oil price so is it just do you think they\u2019re just kind of a human reflex here that the volatility in Q4 cause people to just tap the pause button, or do you see some legitimate risks to these things kind of sliding out further.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think it\u2019s, just natural reaction, when you see that kind of volatility like we saw in Q4 that causes people to pause but we\u2019re actually seeing a very positive movement here in Q1 so I think that some of those decisions will get made, and we feel confident that when they do get made we are going to have some positive outcomes for us and even and I was encouraged by our bookings in Q4, because despite not having booked some of those GNP jobs, we still had a very robust orders growth.","Jeff Sprague","Yes, alright great. Thank you very much.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We can now take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Scott.","Greg Lewis","Hi, morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","Hi, so much of the future story of Honeywell seems to relate software in some way, shape or form and I am little intrigued by HCE in general. Can you help us understand how centralized is the software development effort and whenever I hear about centralized software development, I always think about makes me want to cry, but or worse but how do you, how do you still stay close to the customer and the businesses themselves and still have this type of a centralized effort and ensure that you\u2019re actually getting return on the investment?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. So maybe let me just maybe explain that when we say centralized, that mean sort of the platform, the IT stack that we call Sentience that\u2019s what centralized, that all of our connected enterprises use but then the actual analytics to solutions that are provided, those are very much vertically oriented and the way we approach this is essentially each of those businesses, end customer-focused business, so whether it\u2019s connected aircraft, connected plant, connected buildings, we developed and the MV0, MV1 which was called single pane of glass, which has a lot of value drivers solutions for end customers and we typically partner with a few key anchor customers to help us iterate and drive an optimize the solution so we\u2019re very close to the end customers as a matter of fact, we develop a lot of these solutions with the end customers but we also don\u2019t want to drive customization, but rather standardization so don\u2019t think about this as something that\u2019s sits in corporate a kind of a central level is insular and doesn\u2019t work with end customers, that\u2019s not the case what we want to do is have end customer intimacy, while driving leverage to the IT stack called Sentience that\u2019s really the core of the spread.","Greg Lewis","And maybe if I could just add to that with the leadership from Que, she is applying that customer go-to-market approach across all of those connected enterprises, such that, each one of them individually isn\u2019t having to develop those muscles and skill sets independent and while these businesses are still embedded inside of the for four SPGs those four SPG Presidents wouldn\u2019t possibly be able to give it the amount of time and attention. That Que will be able to do as the President of HCE so centralized really means focus much more so than corporate.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, that\u2019s a very good point, because what the gist was yes, the way this was organized before it still has sort of core reporting into the SPG Presidents in Que but we gave just a lot more authority and control to Que just because when you\u2019re running a $10 billion or $12 billion business, and you have something that\u2019s a fraction of that, it requires a lot of time, attention strategy changes, agility, it\u2019s tough to manage that.","Scott Davis","Right. No, that makes sense and that\u2019s helpful and you guys have done a nice job so it\u2019s not \u2013 it just requires, I think a little bit of explanation, but just a follow-on question really just on Intelligrated and some of the assets you\u2019ve bought around it, are you close to being at the point where you can go-to-market together with some of these products globally, and how long will it take? I mean, just particularly given how regionalized, some of the warehouse offerings are?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, the short answer Scott is now, we are ready as a matter of fact, we are quoting globally and as excited as we are about the North American market, we anticipate being securing some jobs both in Asia this year as well as Europe and we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ve invested from an R&D perspective the Transnorm acquisition is going to further help, but you should expect us to get some more momentum here on a global level in 2019 and a lot of those solutions are finished.","Scott Davis","Okay, good luck. Thanks, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Scott.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","We now take our next question from Andrew Obin from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Andrew.","Greg Lewis","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on defense, just because it was so strong can you give us more visibility into how sustainable some of the developments that you had in 4Q and into the first half I would imagine F-35 ramp is sustainable, you mentioned Space and Defense, I think you mentioned aftermarket, if you could just walk us through a visibility for the next six months?. Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Well, I would tell you, so as you mentioned, our Defense business has been growing mid-teens all four quarters of 2018, and as we look out for the next six months, the backlog growth there is also very strong it\u2019s strong double digits over 20% in Defense and Space so for the next 6 months, as you mentioned, I think, our visibility is very good to continued strength in that area.","Andrew Obin","And just maybe on China, could you just describe more color on specific markets and just your top down view on China\u2019s economy? And how do you think it will progress through the year just because you have such a big business there and you\u2019ve been very knowledgeable?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, it\u2019s been as I mentioned, it\u2019s our China business has been up nearly double-digit just shy of that for the year so another solid growth here, a bit of a slowing in, I would say in Q4, but there are some very clear reasons, and we understood that slowing so that we kind of take it segment by segment if we think about SPS, it was terrific it was up double-digit growth in China, no slowing, actually if anything, things are accelerating in PMT, we had some tough comps, we understood that and expected that we had some big, both orders and revenue growth so we expected that nothing unusual.","Greg Lewis","Yes, we\u2019ve doubled the business in UOP in the last 2 years so the comps are not small.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, exactly. So nothing out of the world of expectation for HBT, as you know, we\u2019ve had some challenges with the air and water segment and frankly some of our distributor partners got a little bit ahead of themselves, given the robust growth that we saw in 2017 and that\u2019s been a bit of a challenge for us all year but we expect that to grow again in 2019 so we think that\u2019s going to be behind us and then with Aero, we had some take collections challenges, which actually limited our shipments, because our backlog was actually better than the revenues would indicate so all in all, we\u2019re not building in a tremendous year in China, not kind of the usual Honeywell strong double-digit growth in China, where we think it\u2019s going to a little bit slow but all of that is reflected in our guide, and we expect to grow in China in 2019 for certain how much that\u2019s going to be? Well, we will see all-in-all, I feel pretty good about how the businesses are positioned.","Andrew Obin","And do you guys have a view on the Chinese economy bottoms in \u201819?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I think that\u2019s a $1 million, it\u2019s a bit of $1 million question Andrew, I think a lot of that depends, and we might know better answer in next 30 days, right? I mean, I think we\u2019re watching carefully what happens on the geopolitical sphere, and with the broader economy because as I said, we\u2019re very prepared from a tariff perspective, because that\u2019s something we can identify and should be able to do something about what we don\u2019t know and where we have some questions, which is whether it\u2019s going to be the overall economic impact both on the economies of China, the U.S. etcetera. that\u2019s I think, at this juncture, it\u2019s worth being a month into the year that\u2019s tough to call, and we\u2019ll see what happens.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Andrew.","Greg Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys and thanks for truly fitting me in.","Greg Lewis","Welcome.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Lot of impact so obviously, look, you guys got a lot accomplished in 2018 congratulations.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Joe Ritchie","I think one of the areas that we haven\u2019t really focused a lot on is that specialty products business and so maybe just a broader strategic question there I think that business is tied to semis, electronics how do you think about that business longer term? You got you did a lot in 2018 this business seems to be a little bit more cyclical versus the rest of your portfolio so maybe some thoughts around that, that to start would be great.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, yes, there is some cyclicality, there is also some stability I mean, we have our Spectra business there, which is doing quite well, our Aclar business, which is acyclical, our Electronic Materials business, which is more cyclical, so it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. Probably we\u2019re given some of the challenges in the Electronics segment probably on the lower end of the curve than we are, but I think like anything, I mean we\u2019re we like a lot of those businesses, they perform for us, but as always, we\u2019re and as we pointed out during our speaker notes today, we\u2019re always assessing everything I think some of the big things, that we wanted to do that we didn\u2019t think that fit our portfolio within 2018 but everything is always under assessment, we\u2019ve never done, and we always want to kind of add and also subtract potentially so I don\u2019t there is no specific update to the to the SP business, but like I said, we\u2019re always assessing and we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s we\u2019ll make adjustments as they fit our portfolio.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, that\u2019s fair. Darius is it fair to think of that business though as being mostly semi-CapEx-oriented?","Darius Adamczyk","It\u2019s a mixed bag. I mean, there is really a variety of different businesses, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of tough to talk about, sort of any given one trend, because you have electronic materials, you have some Defense spend, and you have healthcare in there, you have consumer goods so, I mean you have a entire variety of end markets that there\u2019s exposure in speciality products so it\u2019s tough to say what that total blend ends up to but yes, there\u2019s sort of eclectic mix of various end markets.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Yes, fair enough. And just one quick one Greg, you mentioned the stranded costs earlier, I think the number I had was like roughly around like $340, $350 million.","Greg Lewis","That\u2019s right yes.","Joe Ritchie","So, the timing of those costs, I mean, does it, what\u2019s remaining into in 2019 first, can you quantify what\u2019s left in 2019? Secondly, what we get through those costs through the first half of the year, are they going to be kind of linear as the year progresses?","Greg Lewis","Yes. So we have taken actions that we will have eliminated about half of those costs already as we exited 2018 and as you saw in the fourth quarter with the corporate number of being flat to slightly up, that reflects the first quarter of not having the ability to allocate about $45 million or $50 million to those two spin businesses that are now gone so that\u2019s a little bit of why you saw maybe a heavier number than you might have expected but we expect that to come down over the course of the year from the first to the fourth quarter, and we will exit the fourth quarter at a run rate by which all of those costs will be gone so that\u2019s you should expect to see a bit of a stair-step down and again, keep in mind, that two-thirds is in our net corporate costs, about a third of that was sitting in HPT, so you\u2019re not going to see a $300 million number per se but it\u2019s reflective of a step down as we go through the year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Helpful, guys. Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Joe.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Hi, thanks. Also a sincere thanks for squeezing me. I certainly don\u2019t expect to go before Steve, but possibly before Joe next time anyways, question on non-res, a lot of mixed messages, people talking about low single digits but yes, they appeared talked about very robust commercial projects so just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in that space, is that a very a vibrant market or is it just kind of GDP limp?","Darius Adamczyk","Okay. I mean, if you look at our HPS business, which is probably the best indication of kind of the commercial activity up double-digit bookings in Q4, so actually very, very strong that\u2019s good we also want to make sure we captured a service, that\u2019s the opportunity that business is stabilizing I think Vimal and the team have put the business on the right path, we\u2019re seeing good signs and sort of the secret to the growth there is revitalization of the NPD pipeline and I see a lot of good things in the various segments, whether it\u2019s building products, whether it\u2019s fire, whether it\u2019s our BMS systems so we actually expect a pretty good year and if you take HPS as a leading indicator, that\u2019s also been a pretty good sign in Q4 so we\u2019re little bit cautious in the outlook, but given the stability that we have now, and it should be a nice story for us recovery story first in 2019.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back to Darius.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. Our end markets continue to be strong, and we\u2019ve got simpler, more focused portfolio, following completion of the spins. We continue to execute well, as evidence by our sales, margin and cash performance, and we have a significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. We have a strong performance culture. Our say will continue equal our do. And we are focused on continuing to outperform for our customers, our shareowners, and our employees. I continue to be encouraged by what I see in each of our businesses and our people. I\u2019m excited for what I know will be a strong 2019.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Bendza, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Bendza","Thank you Emily [ph]. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today.

As always, we\u2019ll leave time for your questions at the end.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you Mark, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin on slide two. This has been a very exciting quarter for Honeywell, capped off by another strong financial performance and several important recent leadership changes.","I have asked Tim Mahoney who has been the President and CEO of our Aerospace Segment for the past 10 years to serve as our Senior Vice President of Enterprise Transformation. In that role, Tim will oversee Honeywell Digital, our global cross functional and digitization initiative that is driving improvements in customer service and efficiency. Tim's outstanding leadership has enabled Aerospace to deliver exceptional results.","Additionally, within Aero, Tim led the creation of Honeywell's best digital environment. I'm looking forward to leveraging that experience and having his expertise in this crucial role as we continue to evolve as a software industrial company.","Taking over for Tim as the leader of Aerospace is Mike Madsen, who previously led our Aerospace Integrated Supply Chain. Mike has also served as the President of our Defense and Space business and has held leadership roles within our air transport and regional business.","Mike began his career at Honeywell, and he has had three decades of leadership experience here. We are fortunate to have someone of Mike\u2019s extensive background at the helm of Aerospace. These appointments are effective immediately, but Mike and Tim will of course were closely together throughout the fourth quarter to ensure a smooth transition.","In addition, Jeff Kimbell has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer who is overseeing our sales and marketing organizations to drive profitable, organic growth.","Jeff joins us from McKinsey where he's a partner in the transformation practice. Last, Deborah Flint has joined our Board of Director as an Independent Director. Deborah is the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports, where she is overseeing the complete modernization of LAX including championing the use of IoT technologies. Her deep knowledge of and experience with critical infrastructure, connected buildings, and advanced security solutions would be invaluable to the board in our ongoing transformation.","We have the right leadership team in place, a deep bench of up and coming leaders, and an engaged and experienced Board of Directors who will help us continue to deliver the results you have come to expect from Honeywell.","Turning to Slide three, let's discuss a few of our recent highlights and wins. Through our Honeywell connected enterprise, we launched Honeywell Forge Cyber Security aimed at helping customers identify and act on cyber related incidents. We once again had double-digit growth in total connected software sales, as well as continued growth in connected orders during the quarter.","We announced that Honeywell was appointed by Kuwait, and Integrated Petroleum Industries to provide technology and production systems to the Al-Zour Refinery, which will be the largest Integrated Refining and petrochemical plant ever constructed in Kuwait.","In addition, Honeywell was ranked 13th on Forbes 2019 the world's most reputable companies for corporate responsibility. Our position on this list is a testament to all we have done and continue to do, to be strong advocates for the environment, our diverse employee base, and our communities.","Now on to Slide four. In the third quarter, we continue to drive strong financial results, delivering adjusted earnings per share of $2.08, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range.","We grew organic sales by 3% driven by the strength across Aerospace as well as in our process automation and building technologies businesses. Aerospace generated double-digit organic sales growth for the fifth straight quarter, driven by our strong positions on key platforms, robust defense portfolio, and ongoing demand for aftermarket services.","Our long cycle backlog was up approximately 8% year-over-year, driven by defense and space and UOP bookings, as well as the strong warehouse automation orders and HPS Project orders, which each increased over 20% in the quarter positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2020.","Organic growth, combined with their benefits of the portfolio enhancements we have made in 2018 and our operational excellence initiatives, drove segment margin expansion of 180 basis points with segment margin again exceeding 21% this quarter.","Excluding the favorable margin impact from the spin-offs, segment margin expanded 80 basis points which was 40 points above the high end of our guidance. During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We remain focused on our working capital management at every level of the organization and expect to deliver on our cash flow commitment for the full year.","As we've done throughout the year, we continue to execute on our disciplined capital deployment strategy. During the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of Honeywell shares and announced a 10% increase in our dividend, our tenth consecutive double-digit increase. We also closed three Honeywell venture investments and completed the acquisition of TruTrak Flight Systems, our leader in autopilots for the experimental light sport and certified aircraft.","In the first nine months of 2019, we have deployed 5.5 billion to share repurchases, dividends, and acquisitions. Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $2.7 billion of senior notes to refinance October debt maturities at attractive interest rates, further strengthening our balance sheet. I am very pleased with our performance this year. I'm confident the team will continue to execute and deliver our full year plan.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail and provide our updated full year 2019 guidance. ","Greg Lewis","Thank you, Darius and good morning everyone. Let's begin on Slide five. We posted another strong performance in the third quarter, building on the great first half in 2019. Aerospace had another double-digit organic growth quarter. Sales were strong across process solutions, UOP licensing, and refining Catalyst businesses and building products.","Honeywell Connected Enterprise drove double-digit growth in connected software, SPS contracted during the quarter but the turnaround in productivity products is progressing and the large order bookings we anticipated in Intelligrated have begun to materialize as evidenced by the over 20% growth in orders during the quarter.","The impact of the spin-offs of Garrett and Resideo in 2018, both lower margin businesses at the time of the spin contributed 100 basis points of second margin expansion this quarter. We will lap the favorable impacts of these actions in the fourth quarter. The remaining 80 basis points of this quarter's expansion was the result of our business performance in Aerospace Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies, partially offset by the year-over-year margin decline and safety and productivity solutions that we had signaled previously.","Adjusted earnings per share were $2.08 up 9% excluding the spin-off impact. Adjusted earnings per share excludes $114 million tax adjustment associated with withholding taxes in connection with the fourth quarter of 2017 U.S. Tax Legislation charge.","With that benefit, reported earnings per share in the quarter was $2.23. I'll talk in more detail about EPS on the next slide.","Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion with conversion of 85%. Our total adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months was $4 billion up from $3.9 billion excluding the spins in the first nine months of 2018.","Cash conversion for the year has been impacted by the timing in our projects businesses, primarily in Intelligrated and PMT. Overall, a very good performance for the third quarter and above both our margin expansion and our EPS guidance range. I\u2019m now moving to slide six, and the adjusted earnings per share bridge from the third quarter of 2018.","Consistent with last quarter, the majority of our earnings growth excluding the spins came through segment profit improvement $0.14. That was driven by our organic sales growth, continued productivity improvements realized through our operational excellence initiatives and savings from previously funded repositioning projects.","Our share repurchase program with which we have deployed $3.7 billion year-to-date has resulted in a 3% reduction in share count from last year and provided $0.07 of earnings improvement.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 22% consistent with last third quarter and the outlook we previously provided. Below the line items we\u2019re $0.03 headwind this quarter compared to last year primarily due to lower pension income as a result of the pension de-risking actions we took in 2018, and the higher funding of new repositioning products.","We funded a substantial amount of high return projects more than 70 million in the quarter, which will support our continued productivity focus, transformation and supply chain initiatives, and will also help drive separate margin expansion and earnings growth in a range of macroeconomic environments.","Overall, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.06 above the high end of the guidance we provided in the second quarter. Our better than anticipated performance was primarily from stronger segment profit, and Aero, SPS as well as acceleration of stranded cost removal. The below the line expenses were about $0.03 lower than we had expected, partially due to benefits from foreign exchange.","So in total, EPS grew 9% percent this quarter, another great result adding to our already strong start to the year. Now let's turn to Slide seven and discuss this side of performance. Starting with Aerospace, sales were up 10% on an organic basis continuing an outstanding year for the business.","Commercial aftermarket grew 6% organically, with strong demand above across both air transport and the business aviation. Defense and Space grew 17% organically led by global demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased aftermarket volumes on key U.S. Department of Defense Programs.","Backlog for defense and space is up nearly 20% and more than two thirds of orders with delivery through 2020 are booked giving us confidence that business is poised for continued growth next year.","In Commercial OE, sales were up 7% organically, driven by growth in air transport shipments and continued strength across business jet platforms. We saw increased deliveries across major OE business aviation platforms and high demand for components in air transport.","As we've discussed previously, we remain aligned to Boeing's stated production schedule for the 737 Max and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely. But at this point, we have not seen and do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell in 2019.","Commercial aftermarket sales growth was driven by demand across both air transport and business aviation led by growth in retrofit, modifications and upgrades. In addition, demand for Honeywell Forge for aircraft, drove double-digit JetWave organic sales growth.","Aerospace segment margins expanded 350 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, productivity net of inflation and margin accretion from the spin of transportation systems. The spin contributed approximately 100 basis points to Aerospace\u2019s total margin expansion. As a reminder, this is the last quarter we'll have the benefit of spin accretion aero. We expect Aerospace strong organic sales growth and segment margin expansion to continue into the fourth quarter.","In Honeywell building technology, sales were up 3% organically, primarily driven by ongoing strength in commercial fire products in the U.S.; double-digit growth across our suite of building management products, which was aided by improved supply chain execution, and strong demand for our Tridium Connected Software platform.","Notably in Europe, the quarter finished stronger than expected after seeing a soft market in the first two months, particularly in Germany. Building Solutions was flat in the quarter with projects growth across both the Americas region and the airport vertical, which were offset by declines in the energy business.","HBT segment margins expanded 390 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the favorable impact from the spin-off of homes business. As a reminder, this was the last quarter we'll have the full benefit of the home spin accretion, given that the spin occurred at the end of October 2018.","Segment margins excluding the impacts in the spin accretion were up 10 basis points this quarter, and have continued to show improvement quarter-to-quarter since the beginning of 2019. Overall, it was another good quarter from the HBT team.","Before moving on, I'd like to remind everyone that the Building Technologies leadership team is hosting an Investor Showcase event, November 20th through the 21st at our headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Vimal and his team are going to provide a deep dive into each of the businesses and highlight it's strategy and the technology offerings we bring to the market. I encourage you to listen to the webcast online.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3% on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were up 7% organically, driven by strength across the entire automation portfolio. We saw growth in maintenance and migration services, gas -- products and automation projects and software.","Orders and backlog across PMT were both up high single digits with particular strength in the product businesses -- in the projects businesses notably seeing some movement in global mega projects, specifically in Russia and China giving us confidence in the momentum of this business.","In UOP, sales were flat organically with growth and refining catalysts and licensing offset by declines in gas processing due to fewer domestic fire unit sales given a software midstream gas processing market in the U.S.","We again saw strong double-digit orders and backlog growth in UOP with strength in equipment and petrochemical catalyst positioning us well for growth going forward.","Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 2% driven by lower volumes and pricing and flooring products due to the impact of illegal HFC imports into Europe and weaker end market demand in specialty products.","We are actively working in partnership with private industry, EU regulators and EU member countries to address the harmful illegal HFC imports, while these efforts are under way we will continue to see pressure on HFC pricing and volume.","Overall PMT segment margins expanded by 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by direct material productivity, commercial excellence and organic growth.","Finally in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 8% on organic basis due to distributor destocking and fewer large project rollouts and productivity products and the impact of major systems project timing in Intelligrated.","Segment margins contracted 320 basis points for the quarter, driven by lower sales volumes, which -- while down year-over-year was 110 basis points better sequentially than the second quarter. The management team has taken appropriate cost actions to address the volume deleveraging, mitigating some of the softness, this year. They will continue to realign the cost structure in the fourth quarter as we work through the revenue challenges.","In productivity products, we continue to make progress in the commercial turnaround. Channel inventory levels are going down as expected and on our -- and our on a trajectory to reach normalized levels by the end of 2019.","In our Intelligrated warehouse automation businesses as we've previously mentioned, a large portion is project-based, which results in uneven growth patterns. Recent market data from [Indiscernible] September's semi-annual release highlighted this order contraction in the first half across the material handling market. They are experiencing high double-digit 29% order contraction with 2% shipment growth.","Our sales were down double-digits this quarter as a result of the difficult comps and the timing of major system shifting to the right. The pipeline of major systems orders we highlighted previously have started to convert with orders up more than 20% year-over-year in the third quarter.","The bulk of the sales stemming from these orders will start to show up in 2020. Intelligrated aftermarket service business continues to benefit from our large and growing installed base, again, having a strong double-digit growth from ongoing demand for life cycle support and services.","Moving to Safety, organic sales for the quarter were flat, as continued demand for our gas detection products was offset by decreased volumes of general safety and personal protective equipment. So overall for the portfolio, a strong performance for the third quarter.","With that, let's turn to Slide eight to discuss our fourth quarter outlook and the updated full year 2019 guidance. We delivered strong results in the first nine months of 2019 with higher segment profit and earnings per share in the third quarter than initially anticipated, and we're seeing continued strength in several key markets. However, we remain somewhat cautious in our outlook, given the continued uncertainty in the macro environment and the full year, continues to be solidly on track.","We expect organic growth in the fourth quarter in the range of 2% to 4%, which will be driven by continued strength in Aerospace and Defense coupled with ongoing demand in Building Products and Process Automation, supported by a healthy backlog in UOP and continued growth in connected software through Honeywell Connected Enterprise.","We expect continued segment profit and segment margin growth with year-over-year improvement of 20 basis points to 50 basis points, excluding the impact of the 2018 spins resulting in segment margins in the range of 20.7% to 21% in the fourth quarter.","Let's look at the segment outlook in a little bit more detail. In Aerospace, we continue to see strong demand in both business aviation and in U.S. defense supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs for orders we delivery in to 2020. We will see tougher comps in business aviation OE and defense given the double-digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2018, so we expect the growth to moderate slightly.","In Building Technologies, we expect continued strength in commercial fire products driven by demand in the Americas, continued strength in software and increased project growth in high growth regions.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, we expect to see continued growth in products and services and Process Automation and we expect healthy demand in the UOP from the strong backlog, particularly in the equipment business. The headwinds in Advanced Materials business from illegal imports of HFCs will persist into the fourth quarter.","Finally in SPS, we continue to expect distributor destocking and productivity products to remain a headwind for the remainder of 2019 from both the sales and segment margin perspective. We expect another very strong quarter for Intelligrated orders, but sales will again be unfavorably impacted by the tougher comps and the timing of those major system rollouts.","The net below the line impact which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax is expected to be approximately 155 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to fund repositioning pipeline.","We expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% in the fourth quarter and the average share count to be approximately 723 million shares.","So now let's move on to Slide nine and we could talk about our updated full-year guidance. On this slide, you can see the progression of our guidance throughout the year. We delivered strong results each quarter, continue to expand margins and driven adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 10% year-over-year, despite some deceleration in organic growth as the macro environment has become increasingly less stable in the second half.","Based on our year-to-date results, we are again raising the low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15. We are narrowing our reported sales range, to $36.7 billion to $36.9 billion with organic sales growth expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% reflecting a tougher second half, but above the midpoint of our original sales guidance this year.","We are raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 20 basis points to a new range of 20.9% to 21% reflecting the progress we continue to make in driving profitable growth. We're also reaffirming our adjusted free cash flow guidance to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6 billion as we remain focused on improving working capital and driving cash throughout our Honeywell businesses.","Our higher full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of approximately 10% excluding the impact of the spins. This is an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint from our most recent full-year guidance passing through the third quarter beat of $0.08 as compared to the midpoint of our third quarter guidance range. This latest update, an additional $0.15 low end raise takes us to a $0.30 raise in EPS from the low end of our original guidance range of $7.80 to $8.10 at the beginning of the year demonstrating the strong progression throughout 2019.","We continue to be confident in our ability to execute even in difficult environments and these updates reflect that. We have planned for and executed mitigations against externalities such as tariffs. We've taken appropriate and targeted cost actions to reduce cost in areas where we believe the most exposure to macro instability and market weakness we have.","As a result, the momentum we built throughout the third quarter and a strong finish in Q4 will carry through for an excellent performance this year.","With that let's turn to Slide 10, and discuss some of what we're seeing as we head into 2020. As we head into next year, we're seeing indicators of strength in many of our key end markets but economic instability remains. It's clear the growth outlook for the overall economy will not be as robust as it has been in 2018 and 2019.","We do see continued demand growth in key industries though where we have strong positions. Commercial aftermarket activity will be driven by increases in flight hours, go at a slower pace. Solid airlines demand, ramping of platforms that recently entered into service and continued stable defense budgets. These drivers across end markets in Aero, these drivers across end markets position Aero well for good growth in 2020, albeit modestly -- at a more moderate levels.","Our continued focus on productivity, commercial excellence and our transformation initiatives gives us confidence to sustain our margin improvement path, but likely at a slower pace than 2019 in Aero.","Non-residential construction growth with slight moderation should enable continued demand for building Technologies products and services and the product and the progress, Vimal and team are making in operational excellence and new product introductions should provide the opportunity for accelerated margin expansion, continuing the positive trend that we've seen in HBT through 2019.","In PMT, we expect Process Automation to continue to grow and we've had continued strong orders and backlog growth for UOP, which positions us well going into next year. Macro data suggesting that the softer market in the U.S. midstream oil and gas continues which will affect the gas processing business.","The negative impacted Advanced Materials from illegal imports of HFCs into Europe while being proactively address will likely continue into 2020. We do expect that a growing set of actions that the European Union is beginning to deploy relative to enforcements, fines and seizures should result in the slowdown in ultimately the elimination of the illegal imports of refrigerants into the region.","In SPS productivity products is progressing on its turnaround and we expect to return to growth and margin expansion during 2020. The second half build a backlog with major systems project awards for Intelligrated warehouse automation solutions will provide a tailwind to accelerate growth into next year.","And across-end markets, we expect Honeywell Connected Enterprise to continue to drive double-digit connected software growth as we see strong, initial demand for Honeywell Forge offerings and we'll continue to launch updates for Forge throughout 2020.","In summary, we're well positioned in key verticals and end markets with ongoing operational excellence initiatives across all businesses to drive productivity in margin expansion. We have a robust playbook with multiple levers to protect profit in the event of a market slowdown and significant balance sheet flexibility to generate strong returns through share repurchases and M&A.","Our three transformation initiatives The Connected Enterprise, Integrated Supply Chain and Honeywell Digital will continue to provide catalyst for profitable growth. So, while 2020 is shaping up to be a challenging year we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver. As we did last year, we will provide more detailed guidance once we close out the full year of 2019.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius who will wrap up on slide 11.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Greg. Overall, we are pleased with, and encouraged by the performance from our businesses in the first three quarters of 2019. We continue to execute on our commitments to share owners by generating strong organic growth in many end markets and have many ways to further expand margins and grow earnings.","We continue to invest in our businesses growth initiatives and deploy capital to generate high returns. Our track record of execution continues and we're making progress in our business transformation initiatives including Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell digital and supply chain transformation. We still have a lot of work to do with these initiatives, but I am pleased with the early progress and the significant opportunities to provide for Honeywell.","With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Bendza","Thank you, Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions. Emily, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you everyone. Our first question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi. Good morning everyone and thank you for the time.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Darius, maybe for you on aerospace, can you talk about this business a little bit. How you're thinking about it as part of Honeywell longer term? Does it get bigger or maybe even smaller? I ask this because the management changed clearly, but I look at five quarters of double-digit organic growth and operating margins close to 27% and I ask myself is this as good as they get , so maybe if you could touch upon that for a second?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, yes, I think it's pretty good. I mean, anytime you get double-digit growth and the income margin is terrific, but we don't think that that kind of growth is far from over, maybe certainly we're in a very favorable economic condition, but as we kind of look into 2020, we continue to be bullish on this business. The management change really has nothing to do with the market conditions. And I think frankly, Tim has a core skillset that's very unique to what we\u2019re trying to accomplish in Honeywell Digital. We're trying to template what was done in aerospace because they're substantially more advanced than the rest of Honeywell.","Tim expressed the desire and I fully agreed and encourage him to take out a new role to wrap up kind of his career, and Mike Madsen has been a terrific leader for decades in Honeywell. So I think that this is his kind of a natural transition. But I wouldn't read into the management changes has anything to do with aerospace market conditions. When I point to figures such as 60% of our orders already backlog through 2020, I think flight hours are going to continue. Our aftermarket business is strong. There's a lot of BGA platforms that our ongoing production rates are strong. Hopefully, we'll see the 737 Max returned to higher production rates and back to service. So, I don't see any kind of a doom and gloom scenario for the aerospace segment for the foreseeable future, and as a matter of fact, I'm quite bullish on it.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you very much. No, I didn't imply that about Tim. I think. Mike and Tim are probably good partners. And then just upon the defense business, do you see that slowing down into 2020. You've mentioned before that you're trying to sell out for all of 2020 kind of how you think about the growth profile of 40% of Aero?","Darius Adamczyk","I mean, yes. I think they are tough \u2013 the comps are going to get obviously tougher because we hit double-digit growth for five consecutive quarters, but I don't think that there is \u2013 I'm anticipating any kind of crash or negative growth. We're still expecting to grow next year. That's the expectations, those are plans. We're going to provide you more detail in early 2020, but overall the business continues to have levers for growth, and also for continued margin expansion, because I think something that gets dramatically understated is our focus on productivity, which you saw on our margin profile this quarter which is continuing restructuring, driving Honeywell Digital, ISC transformation, the power of one on the commercial and fixed cost side, and you'll see that coming through in our numbers. So no matter what the market conditions are, that's part of the Honeywell playbook.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","You're welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","One of the things, I guess, if you just don't mind going around the world a little bit and give us little granularity on what you're seeing in specifically China, I guess and then Western Europe, maybe even Brazil, Mexico et cetera?","Darius Adamczyk","Sure. I mean, I think overall despite some of the negativity in the news, we actually saw pretty good growth both from a revenue and orders perspective. By far China, hit the best quarter of the year. I think mid-single digit in terms of revenue growth, strong double-digit orders growth, bookings up double-digit, so actually I had a very, very good quarter in China. Our long-cycle businesses performed extraordinarily well and it was a good quarter. Despite what we read in Europe, Honeywell had a very strong quarter in Europe as well, I mean, up mid-single digits, strong growth across the board, probably the only exception was Italy, we had a little bit of a tougher, but overall Europe was strong.","LatAm actually had a pretty good quarter as well. They were up, I think about kind of mid-single-digit growth, and again some of the challenged economies there. It was a pleasant surprise based on how we're doing. Russia actually did well. Middle East did well. Now, a little bit of the soft spot was India, which was bit unusual for us in Q3, but we're still expecting in India double-digit growth for the year. So I'm not particularly alarmed by the one data point. And then, U.S. obviously continues to be strong. So, overall, both as I look at revenues and more importantly orders which is what positions us for 2020 is actually a pretty strong story and one that was very encouraging.","Scott Davis","Good to hear. And just completely different follow up, but just be -- what does -- what does the customer adoption of Forge look like in the context of, is it kind of trialing and saying we will give this a try for a year, is it more longer-term contracts, is there something in the middle? Is there some sort of standardized agreement that\u2019s starting to emerge as you get deeper into this?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think Scott, that varies based on the franchise, I mean, first, some of the connecteds are further ahead than others. For example, in Q3 we had connected buildings and the cyber security leading in terms of strong double-digit growth. Some of them are a little further behind. We have more mature offerings, I would say in cyber, in the Aircraft segment, the building segment, some of them are still in development stage. Some of them are -- that's typically how you started engagement of our customer. You kind of do a proof-of-concept. The customer is happy that proof-of-concept moves up for an [ph] assignment.","So \u2013 we are some that are in a broader rollout stage, and some that are in the proof-of-concept stage. As an example of our success, we've had a major player in the Middle East, do a proof-of-concept for us which was highly successful and that same player is now rolling out our Forge solutions to the entire oil and gas infrastructure, which will be worth millions of annual dollars per year. So, I think it just depends which one we're talking about, but I think overall Forge was still in the early innings and we're just launching the various Forge offerings.","Scott Davis","Good luck to you. Thank, you guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Moving next, we'll go Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys, good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just first walk through anything in the model for fourth quarter with regards to the segments that you'd want to highlight, I mean, SPS is obviously one that, I think would be helpful to get a little bit more kind of pointed guidance around whether it's organic growth or profits and any of the other businesses that we may see variability outside of just kind of normal seasonality and comps?","Greg Lewis","Yes. So, I think you're going to see something pretty consistent with what we've just done in the third quarter. Obviously, there is variability ranges around all of them. But as I described, I think Aero is going to continue to lead the path from a growth perspective. And I think we're going to see mid-single digit kind of growth, low to mid-single digit kind of growth in PMT and HBC, and I would expect to see SPS down single digits again in the fourth quarter.","And the on the orders perspective as we talked about in the prepared comments, we had a great Intelligrated quarter, 20% plus growth in orders as we've been talking about those major systems project coming in. We expect more that in the fourth quarter and that will help us get that for next year. And then with the \u2013 from a margin expansion perspective, I think you're going to see the \u2013 the obviously the removal of the spin comparison is going to change the overall reported numbers, but I would expect to see margin ranges that are going to look fairly similar from third into the fourth quarter broadly speaking. This is the same playbook. I don't expect like a big divergence from one quarter to the next in any particular business.","Steve Tusa","Is 15% margins still a credible number at SPS and if you don't see progress there over the next 12 months what kind of actions can you take?","Greg Lewis","Yes. I think 15% is still a credible margin rate to build back from as we enter into 2020 and again, if you look at productivity products as an example, it's essentially kind of flattened out. So we're showing organic declines, but the absolute value of the revenues has really kind of flattened out over the last few quarters. And so -- and as we talked about in the channel, that inventory level is going to come down to a normalized level in 4Q, so, as that begins to reaccelerate, and as we continue to get additional growth and the aftermarket side in Intelligrated, I absolutely expect to see margins continue to bounce back and expand into 2020..","Darius Adamczyk","And I just add a couple of things to that. One is, I think, although maybe at a high level, obviously, we would like to print better results from SPS, but in terms of productivity products we're executing what we should be executing. The inventory levels are dropping and our -- and we know exactly what they are and they drove double-digit campaigns for Q3.","We see our sales out data improving. We see better activity -- commercial activity on our Tier 1 wins. So it's still not resulting in the financial results we hope to see, but the progress from Q-over-Q is good. We've also enhance some of the talent in that business and we've had some, a new people joined. So I would say that the productivity products, we're very much on track.","In Intelligrated which is, maybe the other part of the story. I think as we discussed at the end of Q2, we've got exactly the orders we expected to get 24% growth in Intelligrated year-over-year. They came in late. They came in late in September, which were adversely when they come that late, and it's still projects kind of business, it takes at least a couple of months to convert orders, at least to begin the convert orders into revenues. So probably we won't see more of that until we get to next 2020.","But the other expectation I want to highlight is, we're expecting another robust booking quarter in Intelligrated in Q4 this year. So, I think we're -- I'm not worried at all about what's going on Intelligrated. I think the market is being challenged in the first half of the year, when you look at data points from Siemens and some of our industry competitors, I think we're very much in line or even better than some of that. So, I think we're...","Steve Tusa","One last quick one for you, just on Aerospace. Is the -- can you just talk about what the combination of any kind of potential headwinds from upgrades from this year, combined with kind of the Honeywell specific growth initiatives, whether it's connected or anything like that. Is that a -- is that a neutral to next year, year-over-year? Is that a still a positive, a slight negative? Can you just discuss the kind of dynamics between those two moving parts?","Darius Adamczyk","I'm sure. I think the short story is kind of neutral. I think what we get into next year is probably a little bit tougher comps given the double-digit growth rates. So I think that that's realistic. There are some puts and minuses. I mean, is the 737 Max, we anticipate we'll be back in service next year. So that will get a little bit more OE probably some of the older aircraft will not be flying, so we'll probably have a little bit more of the aftermarket stream. I think, with Business Aviation, we'll continue to be robust, we're very bullish on Defense & Space, we're seeing good growth in Space and the helicopter markets again.","I think probably the toughest things on a year-over-year basis will be the comps, the comps will be tougher, but I'm not sure there is any kind of major one timer's that I think would prevail in terms your RMUs and so on, we're continuing to invest in our MPD engine on that, that's been very successful for us. And then obviously Forge will grow. So that's, those are kind of the major puts and takes.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks a lot.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, just a couple of things from me. First, could you just elaborate a little bit on what's going on with the net below the line items? What's driving the change from your prior outlook to the current outlook restructuring and other [Indiscernible]?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, it's primarily the $0.03 favorability, again roughly $30 million in the third quarter, a lot of that has to do with foreign currency and there's still number of the things below the line. So basically the $50 million delta is $30 million of our actual 3Q and a $20 million roundabout lower number in the fourth quarter. Again, there's no huge needle mover in there and there's going to be a range that number too, I mean, we say about 155 but that will move around little bit as well.","Jeff Sprague","I mean, there are some other stuff moving around like other income and pension and the like. What's the actual restructuring outlook for Q4?","Greg Lewis","Yes. We've got a sizable capacity. If you remember, I think we book something like $300 million of restructuring in 2018 in the fourth quarter. And we've got capacity loaded in there for something similar. We're working our pipeline. And as we always do we continue to carry that restructuring pipeline and we'll take advantage of the projects that we have as we exit the year.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think maybe Jeff, just something else to it. We kind of give you a point number on below the line impact, and I think that's approximately. I think we're probably going to revisit that for next year, because it really isn't a point number, there is some movement in it, it can happen from quarter-to-quarter and I think just to be that precise and give you that precise number, it's probably a little bit inaccurate.","I mean, we try to get as close as we can to our estimates, but we have some moving pieces in there, that Greg just described. So I think we had -- I don't think there was anything major that move. There is no major assumption changes, but couple of little things move $20 million, $30 million which given the size of our company isn't much, and you'll get a different outcome. So I wouldn't read too much into it.","Jeff Sprague","Understood. And then just on the projects, the late -- the long cycle order dynamic. So I am quite encouraging, can you just elaborate a little bit on the cash flow impact of that, it does sound like maybe the cash cycle on some of this is stretching out a little bit. What kind of opportunity do you see perhaps to unlock some more cash from working capital or other elements into the next year?","Greg Lewis","Yes. I would say that's, you use the right word, it's the cash cycle, I wouldn't call it a problem. I mean, we had obviously very strong projects related results as we were in last year and then coming into the early part of this year and that's cycle down a bit with the, with the orders pattern that we had seen previously. And now if that cycles back up, you're going to restart the advanced cycle on a lot of those large projects and so we expect to start seeing that coming back through.","And then, we continue to do a lot of work around inventory as well. Our inventory while it hasn't been a huge -- year-over-year cash flow comp problem for us, it's still growing and we're trying to take that down every year as we try to become more and more efficient. So we're still working our initiatives around trying to drive that inventory down as well and we hope and expect that's going to be supportive as we continue to move into the fourth quarter and into next year from a free cash perspective.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. As Greg pointed out, I think the biggest mover for us here in the Q3 was sort of this movement around the advances\/unbilled in much of our projects business, that's really the biggest needle mover. We got a lot of our orders delay. We weren't able to collect the cash. And from a last year perspective, a lot of those orders came in earlier in the year. So we had the benefit of the advances, that's not the case this year and that was a big swing. I would it -- maybe not as big of a factor, but our reinvestment ratio was the highest in Q3 versus the whole year. So that's probably the other backdrop, not the major one for the cash outcomes.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. On PMT and process in particular, it was impressive to hear about these projects in Russia and China. We've heard from your competitors in process about push outs of projects in particular. And are you seeing push outs anything at the margin that you'd call out?","Darius Adamczyk","We were actually very pleased of our global major projects this quarter, I mean we were up strong double digit, actually in that segment. So that was one of the really nice stories for us for the quarter probably even better than we expected. So really, really nice progress and Q4 looks quite robust as well. So hopefully we'll be able to secure those as well, but I think that was one of the more positive stories for us in the quarter and good orders growth in Russia, China, some of the economies that have been, that are presumably challenge but frankly we're not seeing that.","Deane Dray","Got it. And this might be a bit of a rhetorical question, but based upon the upside in Defense & Space this quarter, the 17% growth in core revenues and commentary about 2020, are you -- do you see Honeywell disadvantaged at all in some of the defense industry consolidation that we're seeing?","Darius Adamczyk","No. I don't. We're not generally a final system provider. We are component Tier 1 provider to those. I don't think that calculus changes with the consolidation that's happening. We'll continue to be a good supplier to a lot of those integrators and system providers, but I don't see that dynamic changing.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Moving next to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just first question around, if you look at how demand trended in recent months, you'd called out Intelligrated picking up late in Q3, and also some of the HBT activity in Europe. I wonder if there was anything else that you would highlight that got better or worse over the past sort of two or three months as you moved through it. And also maybe how your own repositioning and CapEx spending plans may have changed when you're thinking about 2020 if at all?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, in terms of kind of some of the changes, I think we had a relatively slow start in Europe for month one and month two of the quarter and they were little bit concerned heading in to September, but September actually was very, very robust than economies like Germany, France, the UK, all did very, very well. So we had \u2013 although we were worried, but September was very, very robust much better than sort of what the industrial GDP print would have you believe. So that was certainly better.","Can as we think about 2020 it's probably, as Greg pointed, it's probably we have tougher economic environment in 2020 that is in 2019. But on the flip side of that, I don't see some fall off the cliff. I don't \u2013 as I look at our backlog, as I look at our growth rates in terms of the long cycle businesses, level bookings we have for Defense and Space, SPS pick up that we're expecting, reasonable comps for aerospace although tougher but maybe not double-digit, but still could growth.","We're certainly not \u2013 we're far from planning 2020 right now based on what we see is doom and gloom kind of a year, that's for sure. And if anything hopefully there'll be some more positive outcomes, looks like Brexit may reach a positive inclusion based on the news we're hearing this morning. Hopefully, there will be more of that positive news to go here in Q4.","Greg Lewis","Yes. As it relates to repositioning, I think we're \u2013 as we go into 2020 we're going to have ample capacity to continue driving our reposition portfolio and pipeline as we have this year as well. So I expect that to continue to be a big part of our productivity playbook for 2020 also.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just following-up maybe on SPS specifically in that context, you're now in the third quarter of your organic sales decline in that business. When we're thinking about the longevity of this downturn, should we assume a classic sort of short cycle duration of maybe five quarters of sales decline there and then the recovery post that? And highlights of that, maybe just gives an update on how comfortable you feel with the market share in productivity products in particular?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Well, I think as we've stated in the last quarter, I think productivity products is the business where we're focused on some improved commercial activity. We saw some good signs of that in Q3. And if you look at the margin profile, incremental margin profile from Q2 to Q3, it was better. The team has adjusted their cost structure to the market reality or their revenue base, but yes, I mean, I think we're trending in the right direction. So, we do expect productivity products to return to growth in 2020, that's very much our expectation. Based on what I'm seeing today. I don't see anything which would prevent us from doing that. So, I can't tell you whether it's exactly five quarters or three or four, but we expect growth in 2020 is kind of the short story.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning.","John Walsh","Just I guess a question around price and maybe also a little bit discussion around the price cost equation, it looks like at least per the Q price decelerated a touch in Q3, but obviously the very strong margin performance, I would assume you're pretty green on price cost, but can you maybe talk a little bit about that dynamic and how that's playing out in the next year as we're kind of still seeing some input deflation?","Greg Lewis","Yes. I mean, we've continued to have a strong cadence around our price across the company. So, as we head into next year, I'm not expecting that we're going to hit a wall and not be able to continue to get price in the marketplace. And as you said the cost, as markets are slowing down we're also doubling down on our procurement team in terms of driving our material cost deflation program as well. So we're going to keep pushing hard on both of those levers and expect that to be a net positive for us as we go into 2020.","John Walsh","Got you. And then maybe just on highlighting the balance sheet capacity, I mean anything to call out there as we look into next year, if there might be anything to do on the deal front, obviously you announced some small things in the release today, but how should we think about the use and the deployment of that next year?","Greg Lewis","Yes, I mean, so first of all, we continue to be very active with our M&A pipeline and there is a lot of things going on today as we speak, particularly given everything that's happening in the marketplace and we hope that, that will actually have a benefit as we go forward in terms of asset prices possibly coming down and making some things a bit more attractive.","As you saw with our stock purchase program, we continue to do that pretty aggressively, and as we go into next year, I think we'll continue to use that as a lever for us, it's been very successful year and I think, barring any large deals, I think we're going to continue to be targeted to take out at least 2% of our share count on a year-on-year basis, so both of those are going to be consistently deployed in terms of our expectations.","We did, as Darius mentioned, refinance of our debt, we've got some debt coming due in October. So we refinance that in the third quarter. So we still retain a very, very strong balance sheet with a lot of access to capital and with our strong cash flow and our repatriation program, I think we've got a lot of ammunition for us to go ahead and use as we head into next year.","John Walsh","Great. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","I want to thank our share owners for continued support of Honeywell. We have delivered strong results each quarter this year and have continued to make great progress on our initiatives and delivered on our commitments. We are well positioned in attractive end-markets of multiple levers for value creation and operational excellence in place.","We are focused and continuing to outperform for our share owners, our customers and our employees. Looking forward to sharing our results, as well as our 2020 outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in late January. Thank you for listening.","Operator","Thank you everyone. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"10470":["Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 20, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Elena Doom - ","David M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Elena Doom, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Doom","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and this webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We also identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, as well as share with you our outlook for the second quarter and updated full year 2012 and, of course, allow time for your questions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","David M. Cote","What a wonderful start to 2012. We had better-than-expected performance across a number of our different businesses, driving EPS above the top end of our guidance range, and it is great to start with such a nice burst of cabbage.","Sales were strong at $9.3 billion, representing 7% reported growth, and that's on top of good growth last year. Organic growth of 6% was also strong. This performance in a more challenging macro environment underscores the value of the diversity of opportunity across our businesses, short- and long-cycle exposure, our products and services and geographies. As expected, our short-cycle businesses posted slower growth this quarter, particularly in Europe and, to a lesser extent, China. However, our long-cycle businesses, particularly Commercial Aerospace and UOP, overdrove expectations.","We also saw terrific margin expansion in the quarter, with segment margins up 70 basis points to 15.2%, with strong sales conversion across the portfolio. As we highlighted in our March Investor Conference, we've made margin growth a bigger element of how we incentivize our people, so everyone's focused on it and interests are aligned.","Given the strength of our first quarter financial performance, we are raising our full year guidance $0.05 on the high end and $0.10 on the low end. We now expect earnings to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share, up approximately 9% to 14% versus prior year on a continuing ops basis, meaning adjusting for the CPG divestiture.","We think this represents a very strong outlook for the year. And while we recognize the macro uncertainties that remain ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue executing on growth and productivity opportunities.","As part of that execution mainstay, our seed planting initiatives have paved the way for exciting new wins, including an exclusive agreement with Inmarsat, a global satellite service provider, to provide airlines and OEMs all of the onboard hardware needed to access Inmarsat's Internet connectivity service. Global online services for commercial, biz av and government customers will be available in 2014, and the contract is valued at an estimated $2.8 billion over the next few decades.","We acquired EMS Technologies looking at the trends around aircraft connectivity. And so far, that's paid off really well. With a combination of their broad technology offering and our execution capabilities, we emerged the perfect partner to launch the Inmarsat global connectivity network. Our Aero team did just a great job.","And in ACS, Building Solutions launched Attune, a suite of professional services that combines cloud-based tools and analytics to help owners and operators reduce energy bills by as much as 20%. And we're seeing terrific uptake.","And in PMT, we continue to invest in high ROI projects, including, this quarter, the expansion of a UOP absorbent and catalyst facility, focused on the removal of radioactive material from liquids. These are currently being used in Japan in response to last year's nuclear disaster. The expansion also supports the production of a new absorbent and catalyst used by petrochemical producers and refiners.","So in summary, we're off to a great start in 2012 despite the more challenging macro environment. And while our shorter-cycle businesses have seen an impact from the slowdowns in Europe and China, we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing in the U.S., other high-growth regions and long-cycle. New product introductions have also helped our shorter-cycle businesses grow faster than the markets served, which, coupled with accelerating growth in our longer-cycle businesses, is leading to top-tier organic growth.","We're going to keep doing the things we consistently talk about, including seed planting for growth and focusing on our key process initiatives and continued strength of execution. In other words, staying hungry, smart, disciplined and flexible.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David James Anderson","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As Dave said, it certainly feels good to report another strong quarter with sales of $9.3 billion, representing 6% organic growth in the quarter. Let's just go through some of the highlights on Slide 4.","As you can see, we saw very strong performance from our longer-cycle businesses, including Aerospace and UOP, which more than offset slower growth in some of our short-cycle businesses. Regionally, we saw solid growth in the Americas, up 8% reported, 5% organically, as well as continued strong performance in our high-growth regions, which were up approximately 20% in the quarter. And as expected, Europe was slower, posting only 1% organic growth. And if you exclude Aerospace from that, Europe would have been down approximately 3% organically. So really in line with our expectations. China sales were up approximately 20%, driven by strong gains in both UOP and in Aerospace.","Segment profit, $1.4 billion. It's up 12% versus the prior year, with segment margins, as Dave said, expanding an impressive 70 basis points to 15.2% in the quarter. This represents approximately 25% revenue conversion, reflecting tremendous productivity as well as giving us a clear path to achieving our full year margin targets.","Below the line was largely as expected. The good news is we funded approximately $25 million in attractive repositioning projects, more than planned, and these will begin to deliver benefits beginning in 2012, the latter part of this year.","Earnings per share at a $1.04, up 18% on a reported basis, 21% on a continuing ops basis. So the better-than-expected performance largely is a result of stronger sales conversion this quarter and obviously leveraging slightly better sales.","Free cash flow came in at $300 million, which excludes approximately $250 million of pension contributions, cash pension contributions that we made in the quarter. Decreased customer advances; higher capital spending, particularly in PMT where we invest in capacity expansion and debottlenecking; were the primary drivers of the lower cash performance in the year. We remain confident in our full year free cash flow forecast for the year, which will approximately -- approximate about 100% of free cash flow conversion. So we remain confident in our ability to do that.","Slide #5, Aerospace. Take some -- take a moment to go through the highlights of each of the businesses, starting with Aero. Aero sales grew 9% in the quarter, 8% organically to almost $3.0 billion. We saw continued strength in our commercial end markets, with Commercial OE and aftermarket strength accounting for most of the gains, while Defense and Space was down slightly.","Now on the Commercial OE side, sales were up 22%, 18% organically if you exclude the EMS acquisition benefits. The increases were particularly strong in BGA. BGA OE up 41%, driven by strong demand in the mid to large cabin aircraft segment where Honeywell, as you know, has an outsized share of content. And on the ATR side, we saw the benefits of growth in both Boeing and Airbus deliveries resulting from the ongoing ramp in production rates.","On the aftermarket, the commercial aftermarket, sales were up 16% in the quarter. Strong gains in both spares as well as R&O. Operators continue to depend on older aircraft to service the steady increases in passenger demand, and we're seeing those benefits. We've had 8 consecutive quarters now of double-digit spares growth, driven by continued increases in air traffic, uptake of selectables and also, safety and efficiency upgrades. But, of course, as a reminder, since we're now lapping spares and R&O levels above prior peak demand, we expect the aftermarket growth to moderate as the comps get tougher over the remainder of the year.","Defense and Space sales were down 1% in the quarter, 3% -- approximately down 3% organically, driven primarily by lower service revenues as we lapped the prior year program completions and also some ramp downs, partially offset by growth in international defense.","For the full year, we expect declines of approximately 5%, reflecting the current fiscal budgetary conditions and reprogramming expected to be felt more in the second half of the year. We'll talk about that more later when we talk about second half and full year guidance.","Aerospace margins expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 18.1%, largely driven by strong commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by higher investments in the quarter in R&D.","Let's go now to Slide 6 for the highlights for ACS for the quarter. ACS sales were up 4% reported, 3% organic, with the favorable impact of acquisitions more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. Top line performance was largely as expected in ACS, with acceleration in the long-cycle businesses more than offsetting headwinds in some of our short-cycle businesses. Now the expectation continues to be for slower organic growth in the first half for ACS compared to the second half. And again, we'll give you some more of that in a moment. But first, just a little bit more in the quarter.","Energy, Safety and Security sales, ESS, while up on a reported basis, were down 1% organically, driven by lower ECC and S&C sales, partially offset by strong growth in Scanning & Mobility, as well as in Security. As expected, ECC sales were weak in all regions, driven by soft residential markets in Europe, in China, compounded by the weak HVAC markets in the U.S. that we've been planning for, especially in light of the mild winter. The good news here is we expect some modest improvement in ECC in the second half as we move out of the heating season, which has obviously been extraordinarily mild and affected everybody in the industry.","Scanning & Mobility growth on the other hand was robust in ACS, particularly in the Americas as we've seen the benefit of channel gains and also strength in strategic accounts, supported by new product introductions. Security also saw notable growth in North America. Intrusion and total Americas sales for Security up approximately 10%.","Process Solution sales were up 9% organically, with solid gains in all regions. The high-growth regions, including the Middle East and Asia, were standouts; while growth in the developed markets, more tempered. Process Solutions also contributed to ACS' overall margin expansion in the quarter.","The Building Solutions & Distribution segment of ACS, or BSD, sales were up 5% organically, driven by strong Americas fire and security distribution sales, partially offset by slower growth in the European commercial retrofit projects.","Just take a minute -- it's not on the slide, but just take a minute, talk a little bit more about the regional cut for ACS. Regarding Europe, we had anticipated short-cycle weakness in 2012. That's playing out. The first quarter outlook, where ACS business conditions were particularly challenging, and we anticipate only modest improvement in Europe in that segment in the second half. Regarding China, the Energy, Security and Safety sales got off to a slow start, ESS, with declines across most of the end markets, most notably ECC, as well as Scanning & Mobility, due to deceleration in infrastructure investments, soft commercial construction. And also, there, we had difficult year-over-year comps. However, there are signs of improvement, and we expect a resumption of growth within that segment within China in the second half of the year.","And finally, on the Americas, as we said, very solid growth year-over-year, with increases in both orders and revenues. Scanning & Mobility led the way with over 20% growth, although security, sensors [ph] and control, Process Solutions and BSD all saw above-average growth in Americas in the first quarter.","Looking at margins, ACS expanded margins 40 basis points to 13%, primarily driven by productivity improvements. Benefits from prior period positioning contributing to that, repositioning contributing, as well as disciplined cost controls within ACS. Those coupled with the acquisition-integration benefits, net of inflation, contributed to the margin expansion.","Revenue conversion for the segment for ACS was 26%, and 32% if you exclude the impact of recent acquisitions, as well as foreign exchange headwinds.","Let's go now to PMT, Slide #7. Performance Materials and Technologies continued their strong growth trends in the first quarter. Growth was up 19%, 12% organic, led by better-than-expected sales at UOP and also higher volumes in Resins and Chemicals. UOP results which, as you know, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, led the way with outstanding growth, up 40%, supported by better-than-expected catalyst volumes and also licensing events. Further, we continued to see robust orders at UOP, where orders are up over 50% in the quarter, driven by continued strong demand in both refining and petrochemical segments, providing further foundation obviously for future growth. Now we anticipate a very strong first half for UOP, particularly given the expected timing of certain catalyst shipments and will transition to a more modest second half for that business.","Advanced Materials sales were up 10% in the quarter on a reported basis, although roughly flat organically. Plan-to-execution was strong across the board. R&C benefited from higher volumes despite softer market conditions in Asia. Now weaker demand in Europe and Asia contributed to lower sales in specialty products as expected. Fluorine sales were impacted unfavorably by the negative year-over-year pricing due to overall supply conditions. And again, no surprise there.","So kind of in summary, a great quarter for PMT. Margins up nearly 20% despite the headwinds and better-than-anticipated for the quarter. So better than we initially guided. And obviously, Andreas and the team just continued to do a great job executing on growth and profitability levels while also continuing to invest in the business.","Let's finish then with the business segments on Slide 8 with Transportation Systems. In the quarter, TS sales increased 1% on an organic basis but declined 1% on a reported basis. And it represents solid performance driven by a significant number of new product launches in the face of challenging macro headwinds, with European light vehicle production down nearly 8% in the quarter and also very difficult aftermarket conditions in Europe.","Turbo sales were up slightly on an organic basis, with new business launches, a favorable mix of platforms and increased Turbo penetration offsetting OE production declines, allowing us to outperform in this market. Regionally, Europe was up 2% organic in Turbo, with mixed performance across the board with a cross section of customers.","North America saw a good growth. However, it was impacted by the mix of light trucks and also commercial vehicles in the quarter. So going forward, we're going to continue to see increased Turbo penetration as a growth driver in all of the segments and all classes of vehicles. Asia had strong growth, excluding China, which continues to be impacted by a weak commercial vehicles market, although we believe the worst of those declines are now behind us, and we're expecting to lap lower comps in the second half of the year.","Of course, what's impressive here is that TS experienced on essentially flat revenues, margin expansion of 40 basis points, largely driven by productivity gains, including the benefits from prior period repositioning actions.","So with that review of the segments, let's go to Slide 9 and let's discuss expectations for the second quarter. Summarizing sort of at the bottom first before going through each of the businesses, we're planning for total sales in the second quarter to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, up 4% to 6% from the prior year, reflecting good organic growth. And EPS in the range of $1.09 to $1.13, up 9% to 13% on a continuing ops basis.","Just a couple of points on each of the businesses. Aerospace sales in the second quarter are expected to be up 6% to 8%, driven by continued strength in the commercial businesses, partially offset by lower sales in Defense and Space. And again, as a reminder, we expect Commercial OE growth to continue to ramp, reflecting strong year-over-year gains, while the commercial aftermarket growth will begin to moderate due to tougher comps, although still outpacing flight hours.","In ACS, for the quarter, for the second quarter, we're forecasting sales up 2% to 4%, reflecting stable growth in both Process Solutions and BSD and modest improvement in ESS as a result of stabilization in some of our short-cycle end markets. So considering these factors, in addition to the healthy long-cycle backlog conversion, we anticipate growth will accelerate through the second half of the year for ACS. And more about that in a few moments.","For PMT, sales are estimated to be up 13% to 15%, driven by continued strength in UOP, the phenol plant acquisition and also moderate organic growth in Advanced Materials. Pricing is expected to remain a headwind overall for PMT in the second quarter, although we do see opportunities selectively in certain end markets.","Transportation sales are forecasted to be down about 7% to 9%, largely driven by unfavorable impact of a weaker euro. Excluding foreign currency headwinds, we anticipate sales essentially flat for TS, against the backdrop of continued lower European light vehicle production, which is expected to be 9% -- down 9% in the second quarter.","Now our outlook continues to assume European production down 8% for the year, which we recognize may be more on the conservative side relative to some of the other estimates that you'll see. However, we think we're -- what we're seeing to-date suggests that the challenging conditions there will continue throughout this year.","So for Honeywell in total, second quarter sales again 4% to 6%, slightly less than the first quarter, up 4% to 6%. Another good quarter of revenue conversion and segment profit growth, driving earnings per share, our expectation, 9% to 13% up on a continuing ops basis.","Let's now go to the full year guidance to give a little more color to the raise that Dave took us through in his introductory comments. Slide #10. As you can see from the table, we've revised our full year guidance, obviously reflecting the strength of our first quarter results, as well as what we believe is a balanced-er view at this stage for the remainder of 2012. We expect sales now to be in the range of $38 billion to $38.6 billion for the year with slightly better than originally planned sales conversion, driving segment margins slightly higher than original guidance. We're now expecting expanding margins from 60 to 80 basis points over 2011. It's clearly a testament to the quality of our earnings outlook and the ability of the organization to execute on key product -- key productivity levers and, Dave, obviously, a reflection, too, of the emphasis and the focus that we're putting on margin and margin expansion.","And as Dave referenced earlier, we're also now expecting EPS in the range of $4.35 to $4.55, which reflects an increase of $0.10 to the low end, $0.05 to the high end of our previous guidance. So on a continuing ops basis, again adjusting for CPG, we see earnings up 9% to 14% for the year, which I think is solid performance, very solid performance against any comparative group.","So now let's walk through some of the key planning. Just go to the bottom of the page on the planning assumptions. Some of the first half, second half dynamics at play. Starting with Aerospace. As we've said, second half sales are expected to moderate due to the tougher commercial aftermarket comps and the more outsized Defense and Space headwinds. Defense sales are planned down for the second half, somewhere in the range of 6% to 8% versus approximately 2% in the first half. Again, built up on detail based upon programmatic detail.","In ACS, we're anticipating better organic growth from the short-cycle products businesses in the second half, with stabilized end market conditions as well as easier second half comps. The long-cycle businesses are expected to be more of the same. So good overall growth for ACS in the second half.","As we've said for PMT, we're planning for overall slower organic growth in the second half against tough comps, driven by UOP which has experienced a strong -- very strong first quarter. And we expect again a strong quarter for UOP in the second quarter. So UOP is tracking ahead of our originally -- original planning framework, which is more skewed now to the first half.","And in Advanced Materials, we've lapped the acquisition of the phenol plant, however, better organic growth is expected as a result of moderately improved end markets. Now the second half organic growth is expected to improve in Transportation Systems, driven by continued uptick of new launches, offsetting lower European light vehicle production, as well as what we anticipate to be continued weak, relatively weak commercial vehicle markets in China.","So in summary, while uncertainties remain obviously in the global macro environment, we're bolstered by the continued strength of our execution, which is characterized by stronger sales conversion, productivity gains supporting that conversion and the seed planting that we continue to do successfully for our future.","So finally, in summary, on Slide #7, before turning it back over to Elena for Q&A, we're encouraged obviously by the ongoing positive trend in Commercial Aerospace, both OE and aftermarket, with aftermarket growth sustaining well above flight hours. Industrial strength in high-growth regions continue to be the bright spots, with UOP and Aero fueling strong double-digit growth. Turbo is benefiting from their strong industry position and platform launches, roughly offsetting greater European light vehicle production declines. And our long-cycle businesses continue to deliver, offsetting a mixed short-cycle order book.","We're continuing to execute on our strategies in sustaining growth investments and seed planting for the future. We're expecting continued good organic growth and strong sales conversion, with continued traction on Commercial and R&D effectiveness, all while controlling our fixed costs through OEF, as reflected in the terrific margin expansion we saw across the company in the first quarter. So to put it in perspective, we're targeting double-digit earnings growth in 2012 from continuing ops, underscoring the organization's ability to be a top-tier performer, with a balanced portfolio of short- and long-cycle businesses, delivering above-average growth and continued margin expansion. And we think this revised outlook reflects again a balanced view of the global economic environment, including where we see strength and where we see opportunities across the Honeywell portfolio.","So with that, Elena, I'll turn it over to you for Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Dave. So Stephanie, we now like to open up the line for our first question. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pretty straightforward quarter. One of the things you called out in ACS was weak Europe and weak China. And I guess my question is, is this sequentially weaker or just continues to be sluggish?","David M. Cote","I would say, continues to be sluggish. We first saw Europe -- I think we were talking about this back in December. We started to see weakness there, and that weakness has continued and it's consistent with what we forecasted to the year. We said back then that we were going to assume Europe was in recession for the whole year. And unfortunately, I think we're going to be right. Fortunately, we planned for it. China is also, I'd say, pretty consistent with what we said, so I wouldn't say we're seeing anything consistently -- or any declamation there, Dave?","David James Anderson","No. I think the only thing I would add is, Dave, that we did see -- as we exited the first quarter, we did see some strengthening in some of our ACS short-cycle businesses.","David M. Cote","And strip.","David James Anderson","And so too early to say that, that's a trend, but it's obviously encouraging, Scott. Just some additional color, it's obviously encouraging in light of what we think is still a very balanced -- appropriately prudent guidance.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I mean, it's going to be in my follow-on really, is that when you think about the potential upside you have for the rest of the year, it seems like ACS is a bit of a wild card. I mean, do you think this is -- this quarter ends up being the low-water mark for organic growth? I mean, I know you're saying 2% to 4% for 2Q, but that seems pretty conservative.","David James Anderson","We certainly hope so, Scott.","David M. Cote","Straightforward is the best that we get from you?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You're doing a great job. Stocks up 4%. What do you want.","David M. Cote","Oh, thank you. So I got to beg for crying out loud.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Maybe first on the R&D in Aero, it was 100 basis points of pressure there. Could you give a little more color on -- was that kind of some opportunistic stuff? Or what are you going after there? And is that -- how should we think about, I guess, a run rate in terms of the R&D pressure there?","David M. Cote","Well, the way I think about it is we're winning a lot. And just seeing the Inmarsat one, which is not one we would have forecasted 6 months ago, it's one the guys had started working on, we continue to win stuff. And I guess all I'd say is it's just one of those things that we're going to manage in the total context of Aero. We're sure going to find a way to support all those wins.","David James Anderson","Yes, I'll just add, Shannon, to what Dave said. I mean, the good part of it obviously is it's driven -- as Dave said, it's driven by the success that we're having in the marketplace. The second thing is that, looking over the course of 2012, we expect for Aerospace, while up on the dollars, to be basically even with 2011 in terms of R&D percent. So maybe some pressure on that as the year progresses, but it's not something that -- I think it works itself way -- through over the course of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean, on UOP, you pointed out the lumpiness which obviously we're all familiar with. But you have several quarters here in a row of some pretty monster numbers. I mean, can you maybe give a little more color on geographically and by sort of end market customer, the parts of that story that are not quarterly lumpiness and that are more of a continuing driver here?","David M. Cote","Well, I\u2019d say the reload side of it consist -- continues to -- what you think of as more ongoing, continues to get better. But there -- these guys are -- they're winning all around the world. There's no one thing that I would point to that, that's driving all of it. I suppose some of the Oleflex wins are -- we could point to. That's been just stellar. But all in all, they're winning across the board. Dave, anything...","David James Anderson","Yes, I would just say that the queue is robust on the catalyst side of the business right now. And we're also going to have, in the first half this year, a very strong royalty revenues as well for UOP. Obviously, as we've guided, the growth percent is not going to be there the same way in the second half, Shannon, for UOP, just as a result of that very, very strong first half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of questions. Dave Anderson, I don't actually think you said the flight hour numbers in the quarter. If you did, I missed them. Could you let us know what those were and what you're expecting for the year?","David James Anderson","Jeff, I think around 3.5 for ATR in the quarter. And we're expecting in that range, Jeff, in the 4% range for the full year. Stronger, by the way, on BGA. And as I talked about, BGA was strong not only on the OE side. It was also very strong on the -- or on the aftermarket side, I'm sorry. So good -- very good quarter for Commercial Aerospace, the aftermarket in total.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And is there a way on this Inmarsat deal for us to think about ship set value or some methodology like that to get our head around the opportunity?","David M. Cote","I don't have that on my fingertips, Jeff. I don't if we normally would disclose that. But I can promise you it's a good one, and it is a nice bluebird.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And then I just -- wondering on ACS, obviously there is going to be FX and M&A moving around all the time. But stripping that away, is something with the 3 handle on it, what we should kind of expect going forward? I think, historically, you said maybe it's closer to 25 or even low 20s. Is that number moving up to some of the things you talked about at your Investor Day, kind of work their way through the portfolio here?","David James Anderson","Yes. So, Jeff, you're referencing revenue conversion for ACS?","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes.","David James Anderson","Yes. No, I think that the number that we talked about, the 20s, mid-20s is a very good target for ACS.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then just one last thing. Can you update us on what you see for restructuring benefits rolling through in 2012 based on the actions in '11 and the few things you did here in the quarter?","David James Anderson","Yes. Look, we'll look that up for you. The...","David M. Cote","We still [indiscernible]?","David James Anderson","We did. While we get that number, just tell you a little bit about the $25 million that we took in the quarter. We're probably going to see anywhere between $6 million and $7 million of operating income lift from that in addition this year and about $13 million in 2013. And we've got, what? About $129 million, $130 million of operating income from repositioning? Elena, what\u2019s the number that you have?","Elena Doom","Yes, it's in that range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Dave Anderson, I wonder if maybe you could just comment on the aftermarket, again on just commercial. Just trying to better understand it. When I think about your first quarter last year, you had 14% growth, and spares were up 28% and repair and overhaul was up 6%. And you look at what you did this year, you're beating that. You're at 16% in spares, continues to be strong in repair and overhaul. And I think the commentary was, last year, that eventually we'd see a recoupling up the flight hours. You mentioned 4% is kind of the assumption for the year. Are we seeing a bigger kind of restock here by airlines? Are we seeing higher provisioning? What is really driving this right now?","David James Anderson","Well, I think there's a couple of things, Peter, that are working. I mean, first of all, as we've said, we're benefiting from the active fleets and, if you will, the mix of that active fleet in terms of some of the older aircraft that are being put into usage. We've got less parked aircraft, which is supporting it. So those 2 things are definitely at work. I think we're also seeing, for us, the benefit of selectables, which is supporting us. Higher penetration in terms of capture on those selectables with airlines, just doing a very, very good job of executing. Now that double-digit rate growth, as you said in terms of spares growth in the overall double-digit growth that we've seen on the Commercial Aftermarket, in the ATR aftermarket specifically, we expect that to -- good growth but obviously to subside and more in line, although still outpacing flight hours in the second half of the year.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. I just wanted to understand. Seems like you're continuing to see outsize growth there. And then just as a follow-up, to stick within the rules, Dave Cote, can you maybe just give us a little highlight how you see the M&A pipeline going forward for 2012?","David M. Cote","Well, first, the pipeline is always good. It's always a question of is it actionable, and can we actually -- if the pricing make sense, and can we make good sense of it? So I would say, the pipeline is always the same, and it'll be a question of how well does the pricing look, and can we make it happen. The nice thing about it is having a big full pipeline all the time means that we never have to overpay because we can be very confident that we've got other good stuff in line. And the more we can find things like EMS Technologies, you can be sure -- we're going to make sure we make them happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from Citigroup.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The question in ACS, specifically the Security, Scanning, Mobility, Dave Anderson's commentary regarding the geographic differences between North America, up 10%, but then commentary that China is weaker. Now China weaker on the infrastructure side, but North America has not had a robust non-res construction cycle either. So what are the geographic dynamics at play there?","David James Anderson","Deane, let me make sure I understand. You're referencing specifically what business there?","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The Security, Scanning, Mobility.","David James Anderson","Okay. Well, Elena, why don't you just give a little color on some of the regional data?","Elena Doom","Sure. So, Deane, Security and HSM are obviously strong globally. But in the Americas, they've been particularly strong. We were -- we saw growth in the Security business in the double-digit -- low double-digit range in the first quarter organically, largely driven by North America Intrusion, which was up in the 15% to 20% range in the quarter. And Scanning & Mobility up in the mid-20s organically within the U.S. So very strong performance. The performance in China and in Europe, in particular, is a bit more muted. But within Security and Scanning & Mobility, actually down slightly organically in the quarter within those regions.","David James Anderson","Some of that, though, is also timing-related. And you're going to see that, Deane. I mean, those are -- in terms of size of business, et cetera, you're going to see the kind of movement quarter-to-quarter.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that was the growth and the products that we saw recently at the Security Industry Trade Show in Las Vegas. And for those businesses, you're seeing -- what was the North America organic growth?","Elena Doom","North America organics in Security was roughly 10%, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First of all, Dave, could you maybe just clarify your comments on the ACS short-cycle trends. You mentioned an improvement towards the back end of 1Q. Was that a comment on China? Or was that a broader comment on the short-cycle portfolio?","David James Anderson","It's really a broader comment, Nigel. It's just -- it's, I think, reflective of the fact that we've seen a little bit of a strengthening there, broadly as we exited the first quarter and clearly doesn't, as I said, doesn't cause us to believe that's a trend. But it's a positive sign. And there's a lot going on obviously to influence the outcome, both in terms of new product introductions. We've got some tremendous introductions weighted to the second half of the year, as well as just continue to grow in high-growth regions. So there's a number of things that we think will add to, hopefully, that trend line.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And I don't want to be too nerdy but normally, we do see this kind of acceleration from February into March. So when you talk about a strengthening, are you saying that's in line with normal seasonality? Or maybe a bit better than that?","David James Anderson","I would say it's a little better than that. But I don't want to read too much into that. But it is an encouraging sign, and I just mentioned it in light of the question made earlier of sequential growth.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just a follow-on in the free cash flow. The accrued liabilities line was a bit more of a negative. And I mean, than we normally see in 1Q? Could you just maybe comment on that, Dave?","David James Anderson","It really has to do with customer advances. As much as anything that's deferred revenue, that's now being recognized in terms of sales in the quarter. Some of those associate with longer term. Most of that associated with longer-term contracts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First, Dave, to use your cabbage analogy a little bit. Occasionally, there's rabbits that come after you when you have a lot of cabbage. What are you sort of doing to make sure they don't ruin what you see come -- where do you -- where are you sort of taking some extra efforts? Obviously, restructuring was one, but are there some other things you're sort of asking your managers to do to be vigilant?","David M. Cote","First, it\u2019s investor rabbits that we're trying to attract, Howard. So I think this should give them a lot to focus on. And we're constantly focusing on what's next. It's one of the things that we do. That whole evolution concept that I was talking about at the Investor Conference, it's just how we think about the company. So some of the stuff, we're ready to talk about and you're seeing; some is in process and you're not seeing yet, and we're not talking about it. So I can promise you that, as I said in the beginning, we stay hungry.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then on that same note, I mean, I know I tend to focus on thinking about Process Solutions as being largely energy, but there are a lot of other businesses in there and we've continued to see FAA -- excuse me, FDA pressure on some customers to step up and do things in that market. Could you sort of address some of the other opportunities outside of energy in Process Solutions?","David M. Cote","Well, I mean, the big places for us outside energy are pulp and paper, farmer and power. And we're doing pretty well in all of those. So I'm very bullish on what I think our Process Solutions business can do going forward. We've got some -- just terrific product there.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is there -- there's nothing -- I mean, I know there's always a lot of things in the pipeline. Is there anything you can sort of talk about in terms of new developments?","David M. Cote","No. They're there, Howard, but I'm not ready to talk about them.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I got it.","David M. Cote","Anything else you don't want me to talk about?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","We've done well here.","David M. Cote","Sorry, I wish I could be more forthcoming on some of this stuff, but I can only promise you we're not sitting on our hands back here.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, I recognize that. And the numbers show that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions then. One, a little more detailed. On the Aerospace aftermarket side, are you seeing a difference in terms of the discretionary versus nondiscretionary parts growth? So is this sort of -- for example, mechanical versus the electrical side. Are you -- or is there not much difference now?","David James Anderson","Well, I think on the ATR side, I think, again, it's really driven by the things that we talked about, Steve, earlier, which is just the aircraft utilization, the mix of that aircraft, the strong penetration that we have in terms of selectables. Obviously, we're getting a large mechanical benefit from that.","Elena Doom","But I would say, the avionic side has been strong, too, with the RMU growth that we've seen over the last 4 or 5 quarters.","David James Anderson","I'm going to cite that, for BGA particularly, is where we've seen that is the RMU growth. Elena correctly points out on the BGA side. We had actually stronger growth in BGA as a percent during the quarter. So that's done very well. The other thing is there's -- on the BGA side, there was deferral of maintenance that occurred. And what we're seeing now is a real demand into the system and pretty good visibility in terms of that demand. So we're quite encouraged by it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And that's across your different product platforms then?","David James Anderson","It is. It is. And the other thing obviously is as you talk to operators and others, it's just the quality of the upgrades, particularly the cockpit upgrades that are offered by Honeywell and the significant appeal of those upgrades. So I hear that anecdotally all the time. I think there's just a lot of goodness there and, again, that's showing up in the numbers.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then at a higher level, if we step back and talk about -- see the weakness in Europe again, and then just the question on emerging markets and whether they're decel-ing or increasing a little bit, the U.S. still insulated from that. But in your business, are you -- is there any thought that the U.S., should Europe not recover, that, at some point, this starts to impact your businesses in the U.S. or you feel like, you know what, we can continue at this kind of clip from share gain, et cetera in the U.S., regardless of what happens, well, within reason overseas? Are we insulated in North America?","David M. Cote","I would say both things you said are true. The first one is there's -- it's a globally -- or I said there's 2 spaces there. Well, the first, we are a globally interconnected economy. So there's -- if Europe continues to drag even beyond next year because they just don't get the political will to do what they need to, then it definitely will have an impact in the U.S. We would argue that regardless of what the economic outlook is, we will outperform in that -- whatever the environment is because of the work that we've done to have the right products, right services. Everybody's staying hungry. A lot of the programs that we've launched over the last 10 years are really starting to come to fruition. We've got a lot of good stuff still coming. The pipeline is full for us on everything: new products, the geographies that we see, the services that we've been able to come up with. I still feel very good about our ability to outperform regardless of the environment.","David James Anderson","The other thing, just, Steve, if I could just add, is it's obviously against the backdrop of a continued weak housing market and overall construction markets, which are obviously huge drivers both in terms of the economy, as well as we will be beneficiaries of them. So I think, Steve, as we see improvements there, I think we're going to see actually net upside.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And, Dave, following that up, are you seeing any commercial -- improvement in commercial pricing on -- for example, HPS or...","David M. Cote","Well, I think, in general, we do a pretty good job in pricing, as we've said before, Steve, in all our businesses. We really just try to do it on the basis of new products and the value that we're able to provide. So I would say we're still going to continue to do well there.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch from Bank of America.","Elana Hordon Wood - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Elana on John's behalf. My first question is about the progression of EPS this year. So historically, the first quarter represents only about 20% to 21% of full year EPS. So if we extrapolate out to the full year, this gets us to over $5 of earnings. So in other words, why would this year be more front-end loaded than previous years?","David M. Cote","From your lips, Elana.","Elana Hordon Wood - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Conservatism or...","David James Anderson","Let me take a shot at that, Elana, and it's a very, very good question, obviously something that we've spent a lot of time analyzing and studying here internally. The things that I think that we pointed out in the call. Number one is obviously the strength that we've experienced in the Commercial Aerospace aftermarket. Again, we're lapping 8 consecutive quarters of double-digit spares increases now. And so while we're still expecting the commercial aftermarket to grow ahead of utilization rates, as we've said, we're not going to see the 15% to 20% growth in the quarters that we saw in the last 4 quarters. We're going to see a weaker Defense and Space. That's just timing. Defense and Space down 2% to 3% in the first half, down 6% to 8% in the second half. I mean, that's just built in to get to the 5% which we continue to believe is the right kind of guidance for you for the full year. And we've talked a lot this morning about UOP, and we talked about catalyst volumes but also some licensing volumes. Those are going to be more normalized in the second half. In addition, you'll recall the Petrobras contract award, the FEED award, that front-end engineering design award, that's almost $100 million of less revenues second half UOP compared to first half. So there's a bunch of things. So as we roll off these first half positives, we will see some partial offsets by modest improvement. We think of short-cycle sales, we talked about that. But it's going to be more like -- if you look first half, second half, it's going to be more like a 48, 52 kind of year, we think, in 2012, in terms of the distribution of those earnings.","Elana Hordon Wood - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to circle back to your comments about Aerospace R&D investments this year being flat. When you talk about R&D, are you including launch cost in that bucket? Or would you characterize launch cost as having a different trajectory year-over-year?","David James Anderson","Launch is excluded from what I just mentioned. And you'll recall launch is down significantly year-over-year because of the proactive work that we did in 2011. You recall 2011 second quarter in terms of the launch contribution, the larger launch contribution recognition. So the R&D -- and importantly, what I'm talking about is, dollar-wise, more spend driven by success in the marketplace. When you look at that as a percent of revenue given the growth that we're experiencing in Aerospace, we're talking about in line for the full year. Roughly in line for Aerospace.","Elana Hordon Wood - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us a magnitude on the decline in launch cost year-over-year?","David James Anderson","Launch is down about $80 million to $90 million year-over-year.","Elana Hordon Wood - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask you about pricing in the quarter, how much it contributed to top line growth? And also, what was the overall per total company price cost impact on margins?","David James Anderson","Well, Elena, I'm going to let you feel the question on the price, Elena. I don't have that. Elana, I don't have that data right in front of me.","Elena Doom","On pricing, net across the company, Elana, it was about 1.5% of the top line from a price cost headwind. We can spend some more time offline going through the business, but it was obviously net positive for the company in terms of margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laton Cana [ph].","Unknown Analyst","You mentioned new wins, I think, in the context of Aerospace. And you mentioned the PPD, the launch contributions will be still down $80 million, $90 million. First, can you remind us of the Q2 dynamic again? Is that down like $70 million in launch? And what do you think it might be for 2013, given some of the pipeline wins you've had?","Elena Doom","It's in -- it's about $80 million to $90 million of headwind in 2012. And obviously, we haven't disclosed or -- and it got enough for roll off obviously in the Inmarsat deal, and it's nearly -- there's obviously some new puts and takes to it. So I think that's -- we'll be forthcoming in terms of the outlook for 2013.","David James Anderson","[indiscernible] tailwinds for second quarter. Less.","Elena Doom","Open second quarter, yes.","Unknown Analyst","But it's a pretty huge one for the second quarter, if I recall.","Elena Doom","Yes, it's about $80 million.","David James Anderson","Yes, it's about $80 million. From a bottom line standpoint, we offset that with a gain. So there was distribution difference in terms of the landscape. The launch was above the line segment profit, and the gain we had was below the line. But from a PDT or EPS standpoint, it was offset.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, understood. And biz jet, you mentioned kind of OE strength in the quarter. We're hearing more noise about Hawker Beechcraft kind of potentially filing for bankruptcy. I mean, could you quantify -- I know it's not the biggest thing in the world, but what it might mean with respect to sales, earnings and, I guess, receivables risk?","David James Anderson","Well, clearly, there's been a lot of -- a lot in the news. It's really difficult to say, really difficult to predict what the outcome is going to be there. From a standpoint of receivables for us, at this stage in terms of our net exposure, it's relatively small, relatively insignificant. And we've contemplated -- any risk that, that may pose to us, we've contemplated that in our forward guidance.","Elena Doom","All right. Stephanie, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave Cote for his final remarks.","David M. Cote","Well, as you might imagine, we're really pleased with our start to the year. All the seed planting we've done over the years with that consistent strategy for growth, productivity and our enablers just continued to play out, and yet they have lots of runway. Our diversity of opportunity in businesses, products and geographies really is a terrific advantage. Because of all that, we expect and continue to outperform in the future. And even with all of that going for us, we are not resting. As I said earlier, you can expect us to stay hungry, smart, disciplined and flexible. And it's our intent to be your best investment.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Derrick. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me here today are our Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude impacts from separation costs related to the spin-off of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses, and U.S. tax legislation except where otherwise noted.","This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and provide an update to our full year 2018 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","This has been a very exciting quarter for Honeywell. In August we raised our full year earnings outlook by an additional $0.05, the fourth increase in 2018 driven by continued momentum throughout the portfolio. We completed the spin-off of Garrett Motion on October 1, and are in the final stages of completing our second spin of the homes and global distribution business Resideo.","We also announced our acquisition of Transnorm, our Europe based supplier of warehouse automation solutions which I'll talk about more in a minute. Most importantly, we continued to deliver on our commitments to shareholders. We met or exceeded our guidance on all metrics. For the third quarter we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.03, up 17% year-over-year driven larger by strong operational performance. We drew organic sales 7%, impressive top line growth across aerospace, safety and productivity solutions and homes.","And our long range orders and backlog were up 26% and 17% year-over-year respectively which positions us well for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. Our focus on maintaining our productivity rigor especially in inflationary environment was relentless this quarter. We generated 70 basis point of segment margin expansion, 20 basis points above the high-end of our guidance driven by sales excellence and strong productivity gains enabled by previously funded and executed restructured. We will talk more about the steps we've taken to address the impact of tariffs later in the call.","We also continue to see improvements in working capital performance coupled with profitable growth which is driving increased free cash flow conversion. This quarter we generated $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow up 51% year-over-year excluding separation cost. Conversion this quarter was 119%, well above our long-term target. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we've seen and I am confident there's more to come as we enhance our capabilities through the deployment of HOS Gold. We're focused on improving working capital management every level of the organization.","Lastly as we've done throughout the year, we continue to exceed our aggressive and disciplined capital deployment strategy committing more than $4.5 billion to share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions through the third quarter. That number includes the dividend paid to date, the Transnorm acquisition and approximately 600 million in share repurchase in the third quarter.","The pullback in the stock in the first half of October allowed for traditional repurchases of Honeywell shares into the fourth quarter at attractive levels. And as you saw we increased our dividend by 10% in September which is the ninth double digit increase since 2010.","Our end markets continue to be strong, and we have a simpler more focused portfolio following completion of the spins. As I said last quarter, we continue to execute well as evidenced by our sales, margin and the cash performance and with significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. I continue to be encouraged by what I see in each of our businesses and I'm excited for I know it will be a strong finish to 2018.","Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent exciting news in our businesses. In aerospace, Gulf Air selected Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency software to reduce fuel costs and lower emissions across its entire 32 aircraft fleet. The software provides Gulf Air a clear analysis in real-time insights that address all flight variables allowing them to unlock savings beyond standard efficiency initiatives. Gulf Air joins a growing list of airlines adopting GoDirect Flight Efficiency software including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Etihad Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines.","In home and building technologies, Honeywell Partnered with Dubai Properties to complete the installment of energy savings upgrade in all 11 Business Bay Executive Towers in Dubai. The project includes a fully digital building management system to monitor and control the tower's mechanical and electrical utilities, as well as fan coil units that integrate the software to provide visibility into electricity consumption. We anticipate that project will result in the same use of 3.3 million kWh or approximately $400,000 annually.","In Performance Materials and Technologies, Jizzakh Petroleum selected Honeywell UOP technologies for new refinery capable of processing 5 million tons of crude oil per year. UOP will provide licensing and basic engineering design services that allow Jizzakh Petroleum to convert crude oil into high-quality cleanburning Euro 5 motor fuels. This is the 20th award for UOPs diesel hydrotreating technology and the 33rd award for its gasoline and unit cracking technology in last 10 years.","Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Transnorm, a privately held European warehouse automation solutions provider that specializes in curved conveyor systems that quickly and efficiently move products and packages for premier e-commerce and parcel delivery customers.","Transnorm has an install base of 160,000 units in a large and growing aftermarket parts, and services business. The addition of Transnorm broadens Honeywell's Intelligrated product portfolio and allows SPS to participant in the fast-growing European warehouse automation market fueled by growth in e-commerce. Clearly a lot of exciting things are happening across the portfolio as we head into the final quarter of the year.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Greg who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail.","Greg Lewis","Thanks Darius, and good morning, everyone.","I'm going to begin on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter consistent with the first-half organic growth was broad across the portfolio with about 65% of our portfolio growing 5% or more in the quarter, and over three quarters of the organic growth coming from increased volumes.","A few highlights, commercial aviation OE grew 19% organically led by business aviation, defense and space grew 14% organically with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international businesses, and safety and productivity solutions grew 12% organically led by Intelligrated warehouse automation business. The markets we serve continue to be strong and we continue to leverage our leading market positions, new product launches and investments in commercial excellent to drive profitable growth.","We generated 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter while continuing our investments for growth and effectively managing the impact of inflation. A big part of our performance was driven by productivity enabled by our ongoing restructuring activities. This quarter we funded approximately $70 million in new restructuring projects aimed at improving our cost structure and optimizing our footprint and supply chain.","The majority of our earnings growth $0.20 this quarter came from segment profit improvement driven by enhanced sales volumes and sales excellence across the company. We also realized the $0.05 benefit from share repurchases which resulted in lower weighted average share count of 752 million shares. This year through the third quarter, we've reduced the outstanding share count by more than 2% and have deployed more than 2 billion in share repurchases.","Below the line items, we\u2019re roughly flat for the quarter with higher pension income offsetting higher repositioning and other funding. Finally our effective tax rate of 21.9% was lower year-over-year which generated a $0.04 benefit consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning the quarter.","Also we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.03. This figure excludes the net impact of an approximate $1 billion favorable adjustment to the 4Q '17 tax charge and approximately 233 million in spin related separation cost in the quarter. Those include 117 million of tax costs incurred in the restructuring of our various legal entities in preparation for the spin-off. You'll find a bridge to 3Q '18 adjusted earnings per share in the appendix of the presentation posted on our website.","Finally, we generated adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter of $1.8 billion up 51% versus prior year. We continue to see marked improvements in this area with stronger cash flows and better conversion enabled by a 0.6 churn improvement in working capital versus the prior year. This strong cash generation was most prominent in performance materials and technologies and safety and productivity solutions. So overall, another strong performance across the board consistent with our prior quarters.","I'm now on Slide 5 to review our segment results. The growth we saw in aerospace last quarter continued as we benefited our strong positions on winning platforms in a robust demand environment. We delivered sales growth of 10% in an organic basis, commercial OE sales were up 19% organically led by engines, avionics and auxiliary power unit demand in business and general aviation, air transport deliveries on the Boeing 737 and Airbus A350, and lower customer incentives which added roughly one point of organic growth to aerospace in total for the quarter.","Defense and space grew 14% organically driven by US DoD spares volume, robust centers and guidance systems demand and higher volumes on key programs including the F-35 and CH-47 Chinook. The aerospace aftermarket grew 6% organically primarily driven by strong airlines demand and maintenance service program activity and business aviation.","As a reminder, this was the last quarter that transportation system is now publicly traded company called Garrett Motion contributed to aerospace business and TS sales were up 7% organically in the quarter, our continued growth in light vehicle gas turbos in North America and Europe driven primarily by new launches.","Aerospace segment margins expanded 80 points - 80 basis points driven by higher defense and aftermarket volumes, commercial excellence, and lower year-over-year customer incentives. In home and building technologies, organic sales growth was 3% for the quarters. Homes grew 5% driven by continued strength in ADI global distribution and residential thermal solutions growth in the Americas and Europe.","Buildings grew organically 1% driven by continued commercial fire products strength globally, demand for our Tridium building management platform in the connected buildings business offset by declines in our air and water business due to low demand for air purifying solutions in China.","HBT segment margins expanded 10 basis points driven by commercial excellence and material and labor productivity including benefits from previously funded and executed restructuring. This was largely offset by the impact of inflation and unfavorable mix. HBT did experience some short-term supply chain challenges and transition impacts related to the Resideo spin-off in the quarter.","As you know the home business was not a separate entity within HBT before the spins and the separation as expected was complex with some significant changes in our organization, our systems and our manufacturing footprint. With the Resideo spin-off slated for October 29, we anticipate that we will be able to address most of these challenges within the fourth quarter and get off to a good start in 2019.","In performance materials and technologies, sales were 4% on an organic basis driven primarily by growth in advanced materials and process solutions. Organic sales growth in advance materials of 6% was driven by a significant demand for solstice more global warming products.","Process solutions sales were up 4% organically driven by continued demand in our short cycle businesses principally in software, field devices and maintenance and migration services. UOP sales were up 3% organically driven primarily by growth in engineering and new catalysts units in China. PMT segment margins contracted as we've previewed driven by unfavorable mix in UOP and we continue to expect that to turnaround in 4Q as we had previously communicated.","Finally, safety and productivity solutions delivered another outstanding quarter with organic sales up 12% driven by broad-based growth across all lines of business. Intelligrated continues to outperform rolling consistently at double digits driven by strong orders growth and major systems and a robust backlog of new wins fueled by growth in e-commerce. We saw continued demand for new Android-based mobility product offerings, as well as for service and scanning applications in the quarter. We also saw double-digit growth in our legacy sensing business.","All in all, organic sales growth was 16% in our productivity solutions businesses. Within the safety business, organic growth was 6% with strong demand for new gas and general safety products. Additionally, the SPS China and India business delivered another quarter of more than 20% growth in sales. Strong segment margin expansion of 150 basis points was enabled by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes and productivity and repositioning benefits.","Now let's move on to Slide 6 to discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter preview reflects the absence of transportation systems for the entire quarter and the anticipated completion of the home spin by the end of October. So only one month of operating results for homes is included in our guide.","You will see this reflected in the updated full year outlook as well. Throughout the year we have seen strong long cycle order rates, and a growing backlog which in combination with our shortcycle momentum we expect to generate 5% to 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. We expect that segment margins will expand between 60 to 80 basis points reflecting a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year margin improvement in PMT and SPS, as well as margin accretion from the absence of our two spun businesses.","We anticipate adjusted earnings per share of a $1.85 to a $1.90 which excludes the segment profit contribution net of tax from Garrett for the full quarter and Resideo for two months as I mentioned and it includes the benefit of the indemnification agreements we have with both companies.","We\u2019re moving the after-tax segment profit contribution from the spins in both periods. Fourth quarter EPS adjusted is expected to be 17% to 20% up. Expected EPS growth will primarily be driven by strong segment profit growth. Other key elements include lower share count due to the more than 2 billion in share repurchases we have done through the third quarter, and higher pension income offset partially by a higher effective tax rate for the quarter at approximately 22%.","This outlook incorporates our estimate of the tariff impact for what is enacted and known as of today. We continue to work those plans to address the impact of any from other potential tariffs that have been discussed but not enacted.","Turning to the segments, we expect continued strength in arrow aero commercial OE and both air transport and business aviation and in the aftermarket driven by flight hours growth. We continue to expect mid-single-digit aftermarket growth in the fourth quarter and we expect that the momentum we have seen in defense will continue driven by demand for sensing and guidance systems and spares volumes into U.S. Department of Defense programs. This is supported by orders growth of more than 40% in the third quarter and backlog growth of more than 30% as well.","Our outlook for home and building technologies for the fourth quarter reflects only one month of operations from homes and a full quarter of the remaining buildings businesses. We expect continued strength in homes from ADI global distribution and home products in the month of October and flattish growth in buildings for the quarter.","For buildings we anticipate continued strength in the fire business where we have been growing mid to high single digits offset by slower energy conversions and building solutions as we have discussed previously, as well as the clients in China air and water. The team is launching new buildings products and we do expect growth to accelerate into 2019.","In performance materials and technologies we're anticipating healthy growth in each of our businesses with UOP likely the strongest driver of demand across equipment, engineering and catalysts. UOP's long cycle backlog is up more than 10%. We expect continued short-cycle demand in process solutions, software and service offerings, a trend we have seen throughout 2018 supported by 11% orders growth in the third quarter.","In advanced materials we expect continued strength from customer adoption of our solstice low global warming products and flooring products. Given the anticipated strength and refining catalyst reloads coupled with continued strong margin expansion, and process solutions and advanced materials, margins in PMT will be up sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we had mentioned previously.","Finally in safety and productivity solutions, the story remains robust in the fourth quarter. We anticipate broad-based strength across all of the businesses led by Intelligrated safety and China and India. We are really pleased with SPS's performance this year and expect this to continue into 2019.","Now let's turn to Slide 7 to walk to the bridge to our full-year EPS guidance. Slide 7 presents a walk to the moving pieces in our earnings bridge for the full-year. In August we raised our guidance to 8.10 to 8.20. This primarily had a stronger outlook for the second half of the year with a small contribution from our change in asbestos accounting.","With the performance in the third quarter approximately $0.03 above our expectation and anticipated strength in the fourth quarter we are raising the low and high end of the full year guidance before consideration of this spins to an updated range of $8.22 to $8.27 which is a raise of about $0.10 at the midpoint.","The expected dilution for three months of Garrett's earnings and expected two months of Resideo earnings will be approximately $0.31. There is an approximately $0.04 contribution from the spin-off indemnification agreements related to Honeywell's legacy liabilities which nets the spin impact to about $0.27.","As a reminder on a go forward basis beginning in the fourth quarter, 90% of the expenses net of recoveries related to the covered liabilities will be reimbursed by Garrett and Resideo. When we take into account the estimated dilution from the spins, net of indemnification agreement reimbursement our new range for adjusted EPS is $7.95 to $8 per share. That equates the growth of 16% to 17% for the full-year removing the second profit contribution from the spins in both periods. Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share count of 754 million shares and an effective tax rate between 22% and 23%.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 to summarize the details of our full-year guidance. We've seen significant momentum throughout the year. On the left side of the Page, you see the original guidance on our key measures which we provided back in December. In the middle of pages are our latest guidance reflective of the strength in our end markets, three quarters of outperformance and a dilutive impact from the fourth quarter spin-off.","We now project organic growth of about 6% for the year which is two points higher than the high-end of our original guidance. Our segment margin range of 50 to 60 basis points which starts at the high-end of our original range, adjusted EPS of $7.95 to $8 per share which is $0.40 higher at the low-end and $0.20 higher at the high-end of our original range and adjusted free cash flow of $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion which is substantially above our original projections and represents conversion between 97% and 103% for the year, all representing very robust performance.","The difference between our reported and organic sales growth is three points in our guidance. We anticipate an approximate one point impact from foreign currency translation offset by an approximate four point impact from our two spin-offs.","On the segment guide, aerospace and home and building technologies reported sales figures have been revised to reflect the lost sales and second profit from the spins. In aerospace, we also narrowed our organic sales outlook to the high-end of the range based on the strong performance to-date and our strong backlog. We have narrowed the PMT sales guidance to the midpoint of the previous range. PMTs margin guidance remains the same.","In SPS we raised our organic sales guidance by two points on the high-end to 10% and raised its segment margin guidance to a new range of 122 to up 130 basis points or 20 basis points improvement on the high-end. This business has performed well all year long and we expect a strong finish based on the oil rates, the backlog and the momentum in our short cycle products businesses.","As you can see our current guidance is significantly higher than our original guidance and accounts for the 2018 dilution from our two spin-offs in the fourth quarter. As Darius mentioned in his opening, we have delivered substantial operating results while executing a major portfolio change.","Now let's turn to Slide 9. We wanted to provide a little bit of preliminary framework for 2019 giving all the moving parts with the spins, the liability indemnity and the other below the line items. First, starting with the macro environment we feel very confident in the strength of our end markets. We see continued demand in growing industries including e-commerce which we address with our warehouse automation offerings from Intelligrated and soon to be Transnorm.","Commercial aviation where we had a strong position on the right platforms that will lead to healthy aftermarket growth, defense where we see robust budgets and clarity on defense spending for the year ahead, and process automation where we expect to see an eventual pick up and large projects coupled with continued demand for software and services.","As we said last quarter, we\u2019re proactively managing both the direct and indirect impacts from the Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs. And are making necessary changes now for the additional tariffs enacted under List 3, as well as not retaliatory impacts if any. While we are hopeful there is ultimately a resolution for the situation, we're planning for the worst and making structural changes including modify some sources of supply, seeking alternative sources, and taking other commercial actions as necessary to position us for 2019 and beyond.","Given that, we continue to expect inflation to accelerate within the business and we are working to minimize those impacts with the help of our procurement, marketing and commercial excellence teams. We expect the impact to be minimal and manageable in 2018 as we previously discussed but now anticipate that the impact of 2019 prior mitigation actions will be significant.","We have established a robust MOS across the company to ensure that we stay ahead of the situation though and will continue with a rigorously address any cost increases throughout our supply chain and adjust prices as necessary. It is our expectation that we will be able to effectively manage the situation and still deliver strong results as we have done through 2018 as you will know this will put some pressure on margin rate expansion.","Moving on to our spin-offs, we estimated the total associated strata cost to be approximately 340 million across the business with more than 50% of these cost eliminated by the end of this year and the balance eliminated in 2019 and we feel very good about where we are in that regard.","We have made very good progress and we are managing this smartly and it\u2019s a big focus now that the spins are done. We expect that the full-year dilution on a go forward basis from the two spins net of the indemnity reimbursement and excluding those remain strata cost will be approximately $0.90.","In terms of other preliminary figures for 2019 at our current level of buybacks we are anticipating at least a 1% reduction in share count. Due to the measures we took earlier this year to derisk our pension plan investments, pension income will be approximately $300 million lower year-over-year and our funded status is expected to remain well above 100%.","Repositioning funding, we expect to be approximately $325 million next year. Based on our planning for the fourth quarter and the repositioning we have funded to-date in 2018, this represents approximately $150 million decline year-over-year. We will continue to take the opportunity to deploy repositioning funding to improve our supply chain, optimize our fixed cost and manage in our remaining strata cost reduction plans.","Finally with the impact of the legacy liability indemnity reimbursements from our two spin-off, we expect that asbestos and environmental will be lower by approximately $425 million. As a reminder, this reduction represents the 90% of expense that is covered by the indemnification agreement and is included in the $0.90 of dilution we mentioned earlier. We will provide you with more details about our expected 2019 performance during our fourth quarter earnings report and 2019 outlook in January.","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius who will wrap up on Slide 10.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks Greg.","The fourth quarter begins a new chapter for Honeywell. Our two spin-offs leave us in a even stronger position for the more focused and growth oriented portfolio in industry-leading businesses across attractive end markets. Each has multiple lovers to drive inorganic and organic growth as well as continued margin expansion.","Our cash performance this year has been outstanding and there's still room for improvement. Year-over-year the free cash flow growth has exceeded 20% each quarter and our free cash flow conversion is also improved significantly. We are rapidly approaching 100% conversion as we demonstrated this quarter. Our financial condition is best-in-class by healthy balance sheet that provides us with significant capacity to deploy dividends, share repurchases and M&A.","Our commitment to deploy cash both smartly and aggressively has not changed. Importantly, we have a strong performance culture. Our say will continue to equal our do, and are focused on continuing to outperform for our customers, our shareowners and our employees. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing more exceptional results, as well as our 2019 outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in late January.","With that Mark, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your question. So Derrick if you could please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","So maybe I\u2019ll start with a couple of higher-level questions. With the benefit of such a global business that you guys have such as many different end markets, maybe you could just talk through what you\u2019re seeing around the world particularly with respect to emerging markets and for hearing some concern from investors about potential project push-outs, slowdown and short cycle activity et cetera?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I\u2019ll take that one. I mean certainly we\u2019re seeing a little bit of China has to be the highlight and certainly Q3 was not as robust as some of the quarters that we saw in the first half. So you know there is - we did have some tougher comps that we expected. We had some challenges our air and water business which has been throughout the year. So I'm not alarmed yet, but certainly Q3 was a bit slower in terms of growth. I mean we grew the Chinese market but not at a double-digit pace that we saw earlier in the year.","So that's probably my number one area to watch. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m concerned about it yet but certainly an area of focus. On the flip side of the coin, U.S. was extraordinarily robust, think about 9% to 10% kind of a growth rate in the U.S. and was probably at the other end of the spectrum. We continue to be very bullish in the U.S. markets and I expect that to continue. And then sort of the rest of the global it was a little bit of a mixed bag.","I mean some Southeast Asia business was good. We had a really nice recovery in our Latin American business that was really good to see that\u2019s been our focus for business activities throughout the year and we see that coming back. Middle East was okay. India was a bit slower than we anticipated but we expect a pretty good recovery in Q4. So all in all I mean there is certainly some puts and takes, very encouraged by what we're seeing in North America with our focus on China as we head into Q4.","Nicole DeBlase","Thanks Darius that was really comprehensive. And I guess just shifting to capital allocation, just some thoughts as you head into 2019 maybe it was good to see Transnorm come through recently. But how robust is the pipeline and I guess if M&A doesn't come through as you expect is there scope to go higher than that 1% reduction in share count that you're kind of earmarking for 2019?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think that's why we\u2019re very careful to pick our wording in the press release so which is that - you should expect at least 1% share count reduction. The 1% is roughly measured with 3 billion that are already committed to but you spot on your comment is exactly right, that's the way we think about capital allocation. And depending upon what happens in M&A, we\u2019ll potentially do buybacks.","There are a couple of things that we think we could get done and announce maybe even as possibly in Q4 probably not close in Q4. So, but I never really count the M&A transactions until they are signed and done. So I want to monitor that quickly we have been in the market early in Q4 as we pointed out in the press release. I thought there were some attractive price points for us and continue to be, but yes - the framework you're thinking of is exactly the one we use, which is, we kind of toggle this between M&A and buyback.","As I said, I would prefer M&A, but it's - as I said on multiple earnings call now, it continues to be a challenged environment and unfortunately it's kind of becoming the new normal. Although we were thrilled to pick up the Transnorm acquisition, and I think an attractive entry point, but from a price stand - but a really important entry point into Europe for our Intelligrated business. Not only is it a terrific acquisition on its own, it also gives us that really nice foothold in Europe, just an outstanding business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","I was wondering if we could get just a little bit more help on the bridge. Greg, I think you said the guide reflects 16% to 17% pro forma growth for 2018. Could you just baseline us on what that implies for segment OP dollars in 2018 for Aero and HBT, as if the spins were out on a full year basis?","Greg Lewis","Jeff, in terms of the absolute dollars, I don't think we're going to highlight specifically those numbers directly. But the $0.31 represents, you could think about that as close to linear but not exactly because of the stub period that we got in homes, because we are getting only one month of the homes results in that $0.31.","So, you could think about it as almost linear but not quite. I mean, that - we've got full fourth quarter high degree of profit that we're losing in December and November. The Resideo side is going to be a little bit less clear from that perspective. But it's - the $0.31 is close to linear but not exactly.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just on the $0.90, so it sounds like stranded costs would be an incremental headwind on top of that, if you could clarify that but is there any deployment of the spin dividends of $2.8 billion in that construct?","Greg Lewis","No, the $0.90 is just simply the lost segment profit, an after-tax basis and net of the reduction in our below-the-line expenses associated with the indemnity. As we talked about the $340 million of stranded costs, which we feel very good about our progress in terms of eliminating that so far, is not included in that number. And we'll update you more on that as we get into the January guidance and we finish the year out.","You know, you can imagine that, as we said, we've taken out by the end of this year greater than 50% of that and we feel like we're in a good position, we're turning our attention from a spin perspective, from getting the deal done to the sustainability side. And we'll be a lot of focus on that but that is not in the $0.90 at this point in time.","And in terms of the usage of the spin dividends, Darius talked about the capital deployment framework, and we'll utilize that as fire power for executing around that framework but it is not precisely included in any way in that $0.90.","Jeffrey Sprague","I'm sorry, just one other for clarification. When you say net of indemnity, do you mean only kind of the $315 million or so that Garrett, Resideo, \"OU\" and then we've got incremental tailwind to get to that $425 million that you're talking about on lower asbestos and environmental?","Greg Lewis","Yes, no. Again, think about that as asbestos and indemnity for 2018 and the knock on effect of the 90% reduction on a year-over-year basis and those two particular line items. Obviously in the asbestos side, NARCO has nothing to do with that. So we have to take that out. But that's the way to think about it.","Mark Macaluso ","And Jeff, this is Mark. If I could, just to be clear, the caps, the $350 million cap that we cited in August, that is the cash payment cap, right. And so as we had said in August, the expenses whatever they are could be higher and that from a P&L perspective could be closer to the $0.40 we cited in the release. So, I think that's where you're getting tripped up, there's a $0.40 expense, separately there's an annual cash payment cap in respect of any year that's $350 million.","Greg Lewis","Yes, so that's when we gave the $0.40, again, that was a - call that a framework. But the actual value of what's going to be in the P&L may be higher or lower depending on how things go. And the $425 million known is reflective of where we see 2018 expense in those two categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just maybe to dig into PMT on a couple of questions. First, with the recent ruling out of SCOTUS on some of the HFC stuff, how does that impact maybe some of the trajectory for Solstice from here? And then, I guess a follow-up on that on some of the refinery comments.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, it doesn't because as you may recall, that - despite that ruling there are quite a few states that are still adapting the HFO regulation and green house gas emissions. So, as of right now we don't see much of an impact yet. We're continuing to work with the regulatory bodies, both at the federal and the state level. And at the present time, we don't anticipate substantial impact and frankly a lot of the companies that we're working with are on that path anyway. And again, obviously that's only a U.S. issue.","What was your second question on PMT?","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yes, I guess more broadly in - with some of the environment going on there particularly IMO 2020 and refiner starting to redeploy, I think UOP is set to have a good shipping quarter in 4Q, how much of that are you seeing in the business today versus may be extended visibility into 2019? Just trying to calibrate as refiners spend when it helps Honeywell specific.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, typically refiners got to wait till the last moment. So a lot of that investment, so that's what sort of surprised us. So we expect 2019 to be a good year. But the numbers speak for themselves of UOP backlog up double digit. That gives me a good side strong booking rates. Sort of the margin challenges that were evident in Q3, we very much expected, we communicated those in Q2. We knew that they were going to be dilutive. But by the way, that reverses in Q4 based on the mix of products that we ship.","So, overall we're very bullish on UOP and what they're going to do. And like I said, at the end of the day I look at the numbers and when I see backlog up double digit like it is, I'm very encouraged as we head into 2019 and beyond.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then just one quick one for Greg on free cash. I think you guys talked about a lot of moving pieces on the pension side and then on the indemnity side, maybe some P&L head that doesn't come quite through on the cash payments. How should we think high level about free cash conversion for 2019 inclusive of the spins in the moving pieces there in?","Greg Lewis","Again, I think you should think about cash conversion next year as approaching a 100%, even expense. We feel like we're getting into that neighborhood this year. And with the continued opportunity that we do have in working capital, we made really nice stride as I highlighted, 0.6 of a churn improvement year-over-year. And this quarter in particular was sequentially better than last quarter by 2x to 3x as well.","We feel like we still have more opportunity to go. So, we're still going to be targeting something plus or minus a couple of points to a 100%, as that number will move a little bit over time depending on specifics but we feel very good about our ability to live in that range.","Darius Adamczyk ","And Josh, I think we're extremely proud of what we've been able to achieve on the working capital side. If you recall couple of years ago, I've made this a priority for the business for us to really monitor the balance sheet as much as we monitor P&L statement. And with this kind of a growth rate that you're seeing, 7% top line, our working capital is now more than $600 million. I mean, that's - I'm very proud of the Honeywell team in terms of what they've been able to accomplish on that perspective and it's coming through in our cash performance.","Operator","We'll next move to Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Darius, never heard you this excited. It's a bit of a change, we would have expected it from Dave but you've been a little more balanced. So, good result.","Darius Adamczyk ","If Michigan loses tomorrow, I could be more excited, but you know\u2026","Steve Tusa","So, just on the orders, you kind of threw out defense, you threw out the HPS orders, Intelligrated obviously. When you think about kind of the long cycle businesses, what were total orders up for the long cycle businesses for the quarter kind of in total or if you just want to kind of list maybe a couple ones we didn't hear like UOP or something like that I don\u2019t know what were total orders up for long cycle businesses?","Greg Lewis","Yes, to give you a specific they\u2019re up 26% year-over-year. Our backlog is up 14% for long cycle and then just to give you a couple of the specifics, HPS projects up 27%, HBS projects up 22%. Intelligrated was actually flat but keep in mind they are up 40% year-to-date so this was tough comps. We\u2019re not - trust me I\u2019m not worried one bit about the growth in the Intelligrated businesses.","So that\u2019s why I\u2019m pretty excited today I mean when I always worry about tomorrow and when I see those kinds of numbers come through, I have good reason for optimism. And I think it points to a very bright 2019 and beyond.","Steve Tusa","And just kind of attacking kind of the base question in a little bit of different way and again this is nearly just kind of like math on actuals. Just using the kind of prior arrow guide of about 3.7 billion and stripping out kind of $500 million number last nine months or for the year for Transport, gets me down to kind of around 3.1. Is that kind of the right arrow pro forma roughly I mean that's just basic math on what you got and already given.","Greg Lewis","I think you\u2019re in the neighborhood.","Steve Tusa","And then just for HBT kind of similar math gets me to around 1.1 type of number - do that sound right?","Greg Lewis","Let us check that one and make sure that one is obviously a little bit less precise given the Homes building split but we\u2019ll come back to on that one particular.","Steve Tusa","And then just one last one for you - the restructuring next year is a little bit higher than I would have expected. I don't view that as necessarily negative, but what is when all is said and done given that it seems like everybody is wants to ignore restructuring in other companies these days. What is kind of the normal run rate restructuring number for you guys in this kind of new constructs going forward do you think longer-term?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes I don't know if there is such a thing as normal number. It is dropping significantly year-over-year by more than $100 million. So it\u2019s coming down some of it is measured with slightly smaller Honeywell. But we still have as you recall back the EPG one of the things we have plenty of runway for and what Torsten's number one mission and you head integrated supply chain is to really reduce our fixed cost base.","So that's where most of that funding is going to be going next year and it's a fairly substantial change in terms of the cost structure of Honeywell. And A) reducing it and B) making it - converting it from being much more fixed oriented to variable oriented. So we\u2019re going to need some continued restructuring funding, I don\u2019t know if I can give you sort of a normal number.","I would think that it still going to be elevated at kind of the levels we projected for 2019 and probably for 2020 and probably after that come down a bit more as we get some of that heavy lifting done. So that's the way to kind frame it up and think about it.","Operator","We'll next go to Scott Davis with Mellitis Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, it\u2019s not much to pick on for sure but one of the things that was thrown out there when you're doing the spins was potentially doing buildings with the resi business and you didn't - you kept all things. But what gets you excited about buildings turning, I mean this is long been really kind of a three percentage growth business not really much better than GDP probably not better than GDP. But you said in your prepared remarks some new products and things like, so give us kind of sales pitch if you will on why you kept that business?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, first of all let\u2019s start with connected buildings. I think our technology offering in connected buildings is maybe as further along than any of the other connected. I mean we have ready to go technologies that we're currently offering and selling and you heard an example of that in our pitch this morning.","So I'm very excited that we really need to be much more commercially savvy to really clearly explain to our customers what that will do for in their building in terms of energy consumption, comfort, security, well-being of the occupants and so on. So I'm very excited about their technology and it's not futuristic it's here now. I think we just got to get through the commercial challenges that we\u2019re facing.","Number two, the market dynamics between the resi and the commercials are very different. The competitors are different, I feel good about our position, I feel good about the installed base we have. I think it's a business that can and should do more. Three, as I think we also have to remember that we created this Homes P&L from scratch, I mean think about this Scott, I mean we did more than 20 manufacturing transitions in a course of the year.","If I didn't have that kind of hard deadlines that we\u2019re going to get this done in a year that would probably taken three. So that team has been done a tremendous job in executing that kind of heavy lift and I think they performed pretty well given that kind of a distraction. So - now that that\u2019s basically behind them, I\u2019m going to modern it I\u2019m continue to be optimistic about what we\u2019re doing. I was with Vimal Kapur and his team earlier this week and they got their hand on the post, and I think that could be a very successful business for us.","Scott Davis","Transnorm seems interesting but I don\u2019t know the company very well I mean can you just give a little bit sense of what other than the installed base that you are getting I mean what you\u2019re getting from a standpoint of technology, is that something you can the synergies at least within Intelligrated is that something you can take more Intelligrated Europe and more Transnorm with U.S. or does it not work that way?","Darius Adamczyk","No, it doesn\u2019t work - is in fact in Intelligrated was a customer of Transnorm so we know the product it is IP protected. It is actually technology differentiated as a high aftermarket services component which I always look for in any business. It has a very enviable position in Europe and frankly I was looking for beachhead to land in Europe Intelligrated. We\u2019ve been spending a lot of organic dollars what I call just part of their R&D and sales and commercial build-out to have a broader presence in Europe.","Our U.S. customers' has been asking us to really have a broader presence in Europe and I frankly wanted to add a business that gives us a much broader foothold. On top of that, I really like the business. We were able to pick it up what I view is a very appealing price in this kind of a market environment that we're in. We\u2019ve differentiated technology and IP protection. So, I think it's I\u2019m thrilled and as you know Scott I really like the warehouse automation space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Darius, Aerospace has continued strength in here this cycle and obviously you do have more difficult comparison to 2019 but it\u2019s hard not to notice the momentum that Honeywell has given it share on the new business jet platforms that are coming to the market. You've talked about connectivity, defense obviously strong. So as you look at the continued product rev in 2019, does it seem like the visibility here toward call it above normal cycle growth and Aero was higher than usual in 2019 and maybe beyond?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, we continue to be bullish in Aero and as you look at our backlog position there's no reason not to be. But you know your initial point is right to which is our comps get a little bit tougher given the kind of growth rates that we seen. If you look at - a little more details of the numbers the two that really pop out at you especially here in Q3 is one is the growth in the business jet market. That's been - that hasn\u2019t been a high-performer for quite awhile I mean and now it starting to really pop as lot of the new platforms are being introduced into the marketplace.","And two the used equipment inventory is down, I mean it\u2019s down substantial which is always a good time and a good sign in terms of new equipment sales. And defense and space, defense is continues to be very strong. We don't think that that's going to change as we head into 2019 potentially it could be a slight down arrow in terms of OEM momentum I don't really expect that to be the case, but that maybe the only place where I\u2019m a little bit nervous.","But all in all, I continue to be pretty bullish on the aerospace segment because all three of these tracks that we always kind of talk about which is the commercial, the business jet and defense are all kind of pointing either strongly up or up. So 2019 looks very promising based on what we\u2019re seeing today.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And maybe Darius or Greg, you mentioned the tariff impact so far but manageable. You continue to work to mitigate all the tariff impacts. But maybe could you elaborate in your comments, I think Greg you said the tariff impact in 2019 could impact margin. How much more ability do you have to price increase in tariffs? You talked about changes that you might make, you talked about sort of looking at your supply chain. So maybe more color there if possible?","Greg Lewis","Yes, so, in our last discussions we talked about the fact that what we're seeing in 2018 in terms of pressure was in the $10s of millions. And as you bring List 3 and List 4 into play and you layer that on over the entirety of 2019 that starts getting into more like triple digits, $100s of millions. And we still feel good about our ability to price in the market. And we've been successful and continue to take aggressive approaches in that regard.","And then as it relates to changes in supply chain, we talked about the fact that we're local-for-local and that's been very helpful for us but we are making a few small moves. You're not going to see us make big overhauls to the supply chain but there are certain spots where strategically we are going to make a couple of changes in those flows.","So, again, the challenge the hill gets steeper but the level of rigor and attention to this has been at a very high level for the last eight months and is going to continue as we go into 2019. The pressure comment is, as you know when you price in the market and you price cost up, so revenue goes up and margins go up by a commensurate amount. But that's just a pressure on your margin rate.","So that's really what I was referring to there, not so much that we're not going to be able to cover the profit impact of the inflation itself, but it's just that inflationary environment with pricing turns into a margin expansion challenge on the upside.","Darius Adamczyk ","And if I could just add, I think there's a lot of unknowns, right. I mean, you have List 3, which potentially that - that rate goes up at the end of the year and then you have a potential List 4, we have timing which isn't particularly clear. So, there's a lot of - there's a lot of unknowns here. We're working through all the norms and I feel very confident in the process that we're building in our - all of our businesses are all over this in terms of taking any and all levers they can.","But still a lot of unknowns in terms of what's going to happen at the end of the year, what's on List 4, the level of List 4 and timing. So, we're prepared, we're ready to act and we're trying to mitigate the best we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Darius, it seems you're building a very focused Aerospace Company but maybe in a more measured manner. Just looking at Aerospace post Garrett, it looks to be somewhat accretive to margin and maybe eliminate the business that wasn't a perfect fit within that group. What sort of opportunities arise for the Aerospace segment in terms of profitability and maybe how are you thinking about the rest?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I think the Aerospace Group has been very good at a couple of things, especially last couple of years. Number one is, they're certainly continuing to drive productivity and becoming much more efficient. There's a high level of expertise in terms of what they can accomplish, and I think they're far from done. So, there's a further opportunity to do that.","Number two is, they're much more installed base focus in terms of the upgrades, enhancements, software enhancements and so on, which obviously continue to build accretion to the margin rate. And overall I like how their team is executing. They had a great wins in lot of different platforms and the execution is strong and I particularly like the progress on the commercial side of the business.","And connected aircraft continues to be a very big opportunity, which we realize longer term. And I pointed this out, we look for a 25 plus kind of a margin rate. We think that that's very possible in that business and we're going to continue to make much forward as Tim and the team continuing to make progress there.","Operator","We'll next go to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","When was the last time that U.S. grew faster than China for you guys?","Darius Adamczyk","It's a very good point. It's been a while but it's interesting how the global markets are evolving right now. And as I look into 2019 kind of an early take is, I think U.S. is going to be a very robust market again. Now, there's a lot of moving pieces in the geopolitical environment right now but right now it continues to look strong.","Andrew Obin","And I guess a follow-up question on that. How does your strategy, you had a strategy really focusing on high growth regions, U.S. going to be a key market but not really a growth market; how are you thinking about capacity availability in the U.S., for example, some of your competitors are talking on process specifically in our shortage of engineers, they're sort of at the limit not really able to take more project, and are we seeing contagion from China in high growth region? So, just a follow-up question.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, I think I'm very encouraged and thrilled to see that kind of growth rate, GDP growth that we're seeing in the U.S. I think it's been terrific. But as you look at, overall if you look at the GDP growth in some of the high growth regions, over the long term they're still likely to be higher than the U.S. I mean obviously U.S. has increased its rate but so our high growth focus strategy I think is still spot on and needs to be. And we're going to stay committed to growing in high growth regions as well as the U.S.","In terms of investment and profile and so on, I mean, I've always said all along that I believe in being local-for-local, meaning that I want to be able to serve North America from North America, I want to be able to serve China from China and Europe from Europe. To me that just makes perfect sense. I want to have people that have a mind set for their local markets both from R&D, manufacturing, sales, marketing, all these perspectives.","And now as we kind of restructure and looked at our fixed cost base, that's exactly the model we're going to. We're pretty mature along the path already. But the short story is, to the extent I continue to see this kind of a growth in the U.S., we're obviously going to be continuing to invest in creating our capacity here in the U.S. to make sure we properly serve the market. And based on what we're seeing this year, we're going to be investing in 2019.","Andrew Obin","And if I could slip one more, you sort of highlighted that productivity was a contributor to strong cash flows, it's just very impressive that despite very robust growth this business is generating working capital. What about the business model that enables this generation, is there a pay back or this is a kind of business that can actually generate robust cash flows as it grows?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I think it can. Number one is, sort of the business profile and the timing of payments particularly for projects business, they are very favorable. Number two, they've done a terrific job in managing their working capital. It's a point of focus and emphasis.","Three, and this is something we've done across our business, which is, we're really looking in standardizing some of terms and conditions. That's been frankly I would say it wasn't sort of cleanest structure that we had and now we're really standardizing and cleaning that up and it's generating benefits. And it's not just for us, yes. It's really true of all of our businesses. So, a lot of things moving in the right direction there, certainly for SPS, but all of our businesses as well.","Operator","We'll next go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","So just more of a comment than a question. You got two same prices this quarter. So, you seem like you're in good shape to manage the extra inflationary pressures from tariffs. But you're the only to potentially for - the companies that are so far. So, I'm wondering, are you sort of working on the base case assumption that the 25% goes in place in January and that we get less full and are you taking preemptive actions to anticipate and get ahead of those potentials?","Greg Lewis","Yes, I mean the short answer is, yes. I mean, we are getting ready. I'm not saying we now started pulling the trigger on all those actions but I think always the way we kind of think about things as we always have to assume the worst case situation and then be prepared. We haven't pulled all the levers for the 25% yet, but we're going to be ready and we're assuming that that will happen. Frankly we think that that probably is obviously increasing as more time goes by and we have to be ready.","So I would say not all the levers have been pulled yet, but we\u2019re certainly preparing them and feel very good about our ability to mitigate all and most of that impact.","Nigel Coe","And then quicker follow-on, going back to free cash flow because to my mind that was the real highlight and a great quarter. You call out SPS and that PMT as particularly strong contributor of cash. Is that because Aero and the HBT were with the spins we're introducing quite a bit conversion or was there some catch-up here I mean maybe any commentary in terms of free cash conversion by business would be helpful?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I\u2019ll start and maybe turnover, I think you nailed I mean from an HBT perspective when you have to do two spins and you have do this many transitions, there is some level of inefficiency particularly in the inventory situation because you were doing a lot of plant separations and so on. And as I stated before I think the team has done just an incredible job to get us ready. Aero they have done a great job on receivables, payables and so on but inventory is still an opportunity.","I think we all know about some of the challenges that the aerospace supply chain is facing so there is probably further gains to be made there. But they've done really nice job. And then SPS has been tremendous across the board whether we talk about all three elements of working capital advances and so on. And then PMT really picking up the pace particular in receivables they got lot of pass-throughs that are now coming in and really nice momentum in building into Q4 and we think that there is even more upside there.","Greg Lewis","Yes Aero is up so they had a good performance to, I think they just have a head start in terms of the disciplined aspects as Darius talked about with things like terms and so on. So, in many ways we\u2019re actually modeling a lot of the aerospace processes and behaviors and what we\u2019re trying to do elsewhere. So you should definitely not take that comment as Aero is not doing well they actually are growing their cash flow quite nicely also.","Operator","And our final question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just a quick question on the HPS, I think in process you talked about a lot of the strength still being a short cycle driven. So just wondered what you're seeing in terms of Greenfield projects large orders there is obviously see some movement in the LNG area, but maybe some offset from a macro uncertainty on large projects in general. So maybe just how you see the Greenfield demand?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean Julian I think the highlight number for me for HPS is projects. We\u2019re up 27% year-over-year in Q3, I mean that's - I think that number speaks for itself. So it's a very impressive number, it gives you an idea that that business continues to win in the marketplace. And I\u2019m very bullish that\u2019s couple on top of the short cycle growth, they are particularly in services and our software businesses, and overall it continues to do very well. So, there is not really much other than good news coming from the HPS world.","Julian Mitchell","And then my last one would just be around buildings, you talked about the expectation of an improvement in growth there in 2019 and probably beyond. Do you anticipate needing much of a step up in R&D or CapEx or M&A to help drive that growth or you think the run rate of investment is sufficient right now?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think in R&D I think it's - I would say it\u2019s not necessarily a need to increase the R&D level but really to streamline and optimize debt investment around things that really matter. I think that there's frankly - there is a little bit of an opportunity around that area. And Vimal and team are making sure that we\u2019re investing in the proper things and really on things that move the needle and not kind of the incrementalism which require a lot of investment that really don't generate great returns.","I think it's certainly an area of opportunity but I think some of their really high performing businesses like fire which have continued to do very well it's not all bad news. And I think there are a lot of good things going on and the buildings part of the portfolio ready. But certainly like in any large business there is couple things we also need to improve. So I'm very confident that that team is going to get it done.","Greg Lewis","And just again back to the spin taking away the distraction of having to split the company in two fundamentally, that took the effort of the entire organization to go do and now having that done. They\u2019re going to have a lot more time and attention to be able to drive some of that growth as Darius highlighted which we feel very good about the end market and our position there. So it should be good.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and just to echo what Greg said. I think we all probably underestimated the amount of time effort and organizational focus it takes to do two spins at the same time particularly when you really are creating a new P&L called homes. So I am thrilled with the execution that the team is exhibited.","Greg Lewis","Yes, I mean you talked about the supply chain changes but we also - we had the clone ERP systems. This was definitely a heavy lift to go do so that team did a great job.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I like to turn the call back over to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. Before I end I want to thank the Honeywell employees and leaders that will begin new careers at Garrett and Resideo for their contributions to the company. Both businesses are starting with strong foundation, a great heritage and I'm confident both will be very successful. We look forward to watching their accomplishment as new public companies. I have full confidence that the strong performance Honeywell will deliver for our shareowners in the first three quarters of 2018 will continue through the year-end.","Our order rates are strong, our backlogs are growing and we're realizing the benefits of our continued efforts to drive software and connected growth, productivity, commercial excellence, and improve free cash flow. It is an exciting time to be at Honeywell, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress as we head into 2019. Have a wonderful weekend.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"11130":["Honeywell International, Inc.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations. ","Elena Doom","Thank you, Leo. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Tom Szlosek.","Today\u2019s call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements of today\u2019s presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10(k) and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for Q3, share with you our outlook for Q4 and provide an initial framework for 2015. And finally we leave time for your questions.","So with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","Dave Cote","Good morning, all. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen by now Honeywell had another terrific quarter with better-than-expected operational performance, and sales, margins and earnings all exceeding our guidance. ","In the quarter our organic sales growth accelerated to 5%, a continuation of the positive trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year; and even more encouraging was the fact that we saw organic sales growth broadly across the portfolio in all our segments. It truly was a balanced contribution highlighting great positions in good industries.","Our short-cycle order rates continue to trend positive as we saw strong quarters from Energy, Safety and Security, and Transportation Systems, as well as continued improvement in Advanced Materials. Our long cycle businesses are maintaining robust backlogs with strong orders and sales growth this quarter from UOP, Process Solutions and Aerospace, giving us confidence in our outlook beyond this year.","Geographically where as you know we are well diversified, we are seeing strength in the US particularly in our residential and industrial markets. As you know we\u2019ve been conservative over the years in our planning assumptions for Europe and I think that\u2019s been a good call. China continues to be a strong market for us both on the short- and long-cycle sides of the portfolio, and we saw double-digit increases this quarter in both the Middle East and India \u2013 reinforcing that our focus in high-growth regions is paying off.","EPS of $1.47 increased 19% year-over-year or 14% normalized for tax. So another quarter with double-digit EPS growth with earnings coming in above the high end of our guidance range. ","Our continued progress on the Honeywell operating system or HOS and other key process initiatives are delivering meaningful growth and productivity benefits. We\u2019re seed planting all the time to drive top and bottom line growth. ","Complementing the balanced portfolio is our relentless focus on new products and technologies which help us to differentiate. Innovation remains the lifeblood of the organization and we continue to win big in the marketplace, and we\u2019ve got some really good stuff to talk about today. ","We\u2019re really excited about the Gulfstream new 600- and 500-series planes that were announced earlier this week, and we have several innovative Honeywell technologies onboard including our avionics and mechanical portfolios. A sampling includes synthetic vision, wireless connectivity, cockpit avionics, traffic and 3D airport maps, and our APUs and environmental controls. ","We also have another first \u2013 the Gulfstream flight deck called Symmetry will include for the first time ever integrated Honeywell touchscreens that will be used for cockpit systems controls, flight management, communication, check lists and monitoring weather and flight information. This new approach reduces pilot workload while improving communications in a more natural and intuitive way. These new products are part of our company-wide HUE initiative and reflect the most integrated and streamlined flight deck in business aviation.","The same with aerospace \u2013 in September we announced that Bombardier Business Aircraft will be the launch business aircraft manufacturer for Honeywell Aerospace\u2019s Jetwave Ka-Band Satellite Connectivity System. Our Jetwave hardware exclusively supports Inmarsat\u2019s forthcoming Jet ConneX service which when it goes live in 2015 will provide bus. jet passengers with high-speed in-flight connectivity virtually anywhere in the world. ","To put it in perspective, this will allow passengers to video conference, send and receive large files, and access streaming content while on the move by enabling them to access Inmarsat\u2019s service. This exclusive high-speed connectivity will also enable us to differentiate our cockpits and mechanical systems through innovative data sharing and services, making aircraft and pilots more efficient.","In our Scanning and Mobility business we\u2019re working with the United States Postal Service, one of the largest global mail carriers, to deploy more than 75,000 units of our next-generation mobile delivery device by year\u2019s end. This custom-branded mobile device is based on our market-leading mobile computing technology, the Dolphin 99ex \u2013 clever name, right? Used by postal carriers and mail processing employees, the device improves critical activities related to making on-time deliveries including reliable tracking information, proof of delivery for Priority Mail and postal route navigation support.","We\u2019re also excited about the growth we\u2019re seeing from Solstice, our new line of refrigerants, insulation materials, aerosols and solvents that have global warming potential lower than CO2. In September at a White House event we announced that we will increase production of Solstice products and as a result will drive a 50% reduction in our annual production of high-GWP hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs on a CO2 equivalent basis prior to 2020. We project that the use of our Solstice products will eliminate more than 350 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2025. That\u2019s equal to removing 70 million cars from the road for one year.","And in mobile air conditioning we\u2019ve had significant wins from global customers and expect our sales to continue to ramp, as Solstice helps customers meet CAP A standards in the US and the new Mac regulation in Europe which goes into full effect in 2017. So with the increased order book for Solstice applications and the new capacity coming online, Fluorines is positioned for terrific growth in 2015.","If I take a look at where we stand for the year with just about two months left, we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver at the high end of the guidance we set for this year last December. As a reminder, we\u2019ve stuck by our sales and earnings outlook all year, steadily increasing the low end of our pro forma EPS guidance to reflect the strong year-to-date performance. And we\u2019re doing it again this quarter, raising the low end of our 2014 EPS guidance by $0.05 to $5.50 to $5.555. That\u2019s up 11% to 12% year-over-year \u2013 not bad at all.","So turning to 2015, and you\u2019ll hear more from Tom on this, we\u2019re going to continue to remain conservative on the global economy. We haven\u2019t counted on much from the macro environment historically and so far that has been a good call. We\u2019re confident in our continued outperformance because one, our portfolio is aligned to favorable trends like energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization, and customer productivity that continue to trend positive. And two, we have been conservative on costs.","We\u2019re in the process of completing our annual operating plans and overall we see prospects for another good year in 2015. As I mentioned already we have a very healthy backlog and see positive order and win rates across the portfolio. We\u2019re also expecting another year of margin expansion. We\u2019re going to continue executing on our key strategies for growth including penetration of high-growth regions and sustaining our investments in high ROI CAPEX and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost discipline and ensuring we deliver the savings from restructuring projects that we\u2019ve funded for the last few years.","Our strength of execution has led Honeywell in the past to strong earnings growth and another year of outperformance in 2015, remaining on track to the long-term targets we gave you back in March. So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Okay, thanks Dave and good morning. On Slide 4 let me walk you through the financial results for Q3 \u2013 as you can see, some very strong numbers and every metric came in at or above the guidance we provided in July.","Sales of $10.1 billion were up 5% on a reported and organic basis and the growth was pervasive throughout the portfolio. We\u2019ll dive into some of the business specifics in a moment but we\u2019re encouraged by the improvement in organic sales growth as we\u2019ve progressed throughout the year. Remember, it was 1% in Q1, 3% in Q2 and now 5% in Q3.","On a regional basis organic sales were up 5% in the US, 1% in Europe, 4% in China and double digits in a number of our other high-growth regions. In Europe we have experienced stable growth rates in the first three quarters of the year, modest growth rates which are very consistent with what we saw in 2012 and 2013. We are planning more of the same for Europe in Q4 and into 2015. ","As for China, the growth was impacted by our deliberate shift of resins and chemicals exports to other parts of Southeast Asia, so excluding that our China sales would have been up 7% in the quarter. On a similar basis, we expect China to grow sales faster than GDP for the full year.","Segment profit growth and margin expansion were both strong in the quarter. Segment profit increased 9% while segment margins expanded 70 basis points to 17.4%, which by the way is 20 basis points more than our guidance. We had profit growth and margin expansion in each of our three SBGs, so again, a balanced contribution across the portfolio. ","The businesses benefited from higher volume in the quarter, and productivity continued to be a key driver of margin expansion. These elements more than offset inflation and our continued investments for growth in sales, marketing, and product development. Items below segment profit were mostly as anticipated and so our net income increased 14% normalized for tax \u2013 not bad paired with a 5% sales increase. Also we funded $21 million of restructuring projects in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $120 million.","The Q3 tax rate came in at 24.6% versus 27.2% in 2013 and versus the 26.5% we planned. There are a number of moving parts that sometimes make the tax rates vary quarter by quarter, however we continue to expect a tax rate of 26.5% for the full year consistent with our initial planning.","So reported earnings per share of $1.47 in the quarter, up 19% versus the prior year. Normalizing for tax, EPS would have been $1.43, up 14% which is $0.01 above the high end of the guidance we provided in July. Even with essentially flat share count we once again achieved double-digit EPS driven primarily by stronger sales and segment margins.","Finally, free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter was 12% higher than 2013 despite an approximate 28% increase in CAPEX investments. Overall another strong quarter, giving us confidence heading into the last three months of the year.","Moving to Slide 5 we\u2019re looking at Aerospace results which as you will recall include Transportation Systems in both years. Aerospace sales were flat in the quarter on a reported basis, reflecting the friction materials divestiture, but were up 3% organically which was at the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales growth accelerated in both commercial aero and defense and space while Transportation Systems saw continued strong top line organic growth. ","Aerospace margins expanded by 150 basis points driven by productivity net of inflation, where material productivity continues to be a significant driver; also commercial excellence and the favorable impact of the friction materials divestiture. Starting with commercial OE, sales increased 5% with good growth in both air transport and regional as well as business and general aviation. In ATR we saw the continued benefit of higher OE build rates while business aviation saw increased engine shipments coming with certifications on the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer Legacy 500.","Commercial aircraft sales were up 2% in the quarter with strong spares growth in ATR. ATR had double-digit spares growth with increased mechanical and electrical demand across the major regions. We\u2019re expecting the ATR aftermarket growth to be in line with flight hours in Q4 and would characterize current airline buying activity as stable to modestly better. ","The ATR spares growth was offset by anticipated lower repair and overall activity and a decline in BGA RMUs; that is retrofit modifications and upgrades. You will recall that RMU sales growth has been on a tear for the last couple of years, making comparisons to prior periods challenging. We\u2019re still excited by this business and continue to invest to develop new offerings.","Defense and space sales returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 3% and continued the improvement we\u2019ve seen throughout 2014. You might recall we were down 8% in Q1 and 1% in Q2 so the trend as we predicted is improving. International programs continued to drive growth with double-digit sales increases, while our US DOD sales grew modestly. And government services declines continued to moderate on a year-over-year basis.","Transportations Systems sales declined 10% on a reported basis, again reflecting the friction materials divestiture, but were up 4% organically. Once again we saw strong turbo volume growth across our three largest regions \u2013 Europe, North America, and China. And in each of these regions our volume growth outpaced auto production. ","Two-thirds of the volume growth was attributable to light vehicle gas applications where we continued to see increased global penetration. We also saw our European commercial vehicle volume more than double in the quarter as we continued to benefit from new programs following the implementation of Euro-6 emission regulations in the region.","On Slide 6 we are looking at ACS results for the quarter. Sales were up 9% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis \u2013 again at the high end of our guidance. The difference in the two rates principally reflects the contributions of Intermec. ESS sales, so the products businesses, were up 6% organically, continuing the trend of progressively stronger growth we have seen in each quarter in 2014. It\u2019s hard to single out one business in the ESS portfolio because the growth was very broad, but scanning mobility and industrial safety celebrated the most.","ESS benefited from new product introductions; higher US residential sales which benefited both ECC and Security; US non-residential improvement in ECC, fire and industrial safety; and further penetration in high-growth regions particularly in China where ESS once again had double-digit sales growth in the quarter.","Building Solutions and Distribution or BSD sales were up 2% with continued strength in the Americas fire and security distribution businesses offset by flat sales in building solutions. We are encouraged however as building solutions has seen an increase in North American service and energy retrofit orders. Both the global solutions backlog and service banks are up handsomely from the same point last year, supporting our outlook for sales acceleration in 2015.","In the non-residential sector the trends are similar to the first half of the year. In the ESS products businesses that serve non-residential, we\u2019ve continued to see modest growth in commercial products throughout Q3. However, we did see an acceleration of growth on the industrial side with strength in the Americas business particularly. We anticipate further improvement in Q4 and into 2015 on the commercial and industrial products side.","As for building solutions, I mentioned that the backlog and service banks are up year-over-year and we continue to expect energy efficiency projects to support global acceleration into next year.","ACS margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter and were up 50 basis points excluding the minor dilution from M&A. ACS continues to benefit from higher volume, commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation while also continuing to invest for future growth. One such investment area is connected homes where we are quite excited by the roadmap of future, integrated offerings in heating, air conditioning, security and lighting controls. Already we have more than a million internet-connected devices.","Moving to Slide 7 for Performance Materials and Technology, PMT sales were $2.5 billion, up 7% organically and were above the high end of our guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected results in both UOP and Process Solutions. ","UOP sales increased 8% in the quarter driven by increased catalyst and gas processing sales reflecting a continued strong refining, petrochemical and gas market. We continue to see strong orders trends in gas processing particularly at Thomas Russell. At the end of Q3 UOP\u2019s backlog stood at $2.6 billion driven by a strong customer adoption of new technologies and investments in new capacity. ","In Process Solutions we are encouraged by the accelerated growth of 5% driven by our Advanced Solutions Software and Services businesses as well as higher sales in field products. High-growth regions remain a huge priority for Process Solutions and they delivered double-digit sales growth from China, India and the Middle East. Borders growth also continued at a strong pace, continuing the Q2 trend, and the HPS backlog is up nicely over the same point in 2013. As we\u2019ll preview later on we\u2019re expecting the sales improvement in the second half of this year to continue in 2015 for HPS.","Advanced Materials sales increased 7% in the quarter, also continuing the trend we\u2019ve seen throughout 2014. We\u2019ve seen volume increases across the businesses with particular strength in foreign products which was up double digits, driven by a new low-global-warming potential product. ","Segment margins at PMT were up 20 basis points to 17.5% consistent with our expectations, driven by higher volume and productivity net of inflation partially offset by price raw headwinds in chemicals and continued investments for growth. HPS converted particularly well, continuing its successful business transformation and benefiting from the growth I mentioned in higher-margin Advanced Solutions Software and Services. UOP continues to also deliver outstanding profitability.","So now I\u2019m on Slide 8 with a preview of Q4. We\u2019re expecting sales of $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion, approximately flat reported or up 3% on an organic basis. And again, this assumes a Euro rate of $1.25 for the quarter. As a reminder, we\u2019re facing a tougher set of comps in Q4 as organic sales were up 5% in Q4 2013 versus only 1% in Q3 2013. ","Segment margins for Q4 are expected to be up approximately 120 basis points with pro forma earnings in the range of $1.37 to $1.42 per share, up 10% to 15% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we\u2019re still planning a full year 2014 tax rate of 26.5%, so that implies the Q4 tax rate to be approximately 28.8%.","Our Aerospace sales on a reported basis are expected to be down approximately 3% reflecting the year-over-year absence of friction materials in the quarter. On an organic basis sales are expected to be up approximately 2%, and as a reminder, in Q4 2013 Aero recognized a significant IP litigation settlement resulting in a royalty gain of $63 million in Defense and Space that was offset by OEM payments in BGA. Both of these items were included and therefore netted out in sales and segment profit at the Aerospace level last year.","In Q4 Commercial OE sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a reported basis, and that\u2019s mid-single-digit excluding the year-over-year impact I mentioned from the higher BGA OEM payments. The growth is driven by the favorable trend in demand for high-value business jet platforms where we have significant new engine content. ","Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to be up low-single-digit in the quarter with an improvement in airline and business jet repair and overhaul activity as evidenced by the increase we\u2019ve seen in shop receipts. However this strength will be partially offset by more modest spares growth driven by declines in BGA RMU activity that I mentioned earlier. Defense and space sales are expected to be up slightly, excluding the impact of the royalty gain in Q4 2013 I discussed earlier. ","In Transportation Systems we\u2019re expecting sales to be approximately flat on an organic basis primarily due to challenging comparisons to prior year. You\u2019ll recall that in Q4 2013 TS was up 15%. We\u2019re expecting Transportation Systems to have good volume growth in Q1 2015 driven primarily by new launches entering the market.","As for Aerospace margins we expect an increase of approximately 200 basis points in Q4 driven by significant productivity improvements across the portfolio and commercial excellence. Continued focus on driving productivity and direct material costs and the benefits from functional transformation are helping us to support the growth investments we\u2019re making in the business as well as to drive the improvement in profitability.","For ACs sales are expected to be up approximately 4% on an organic basis excluding an approximate 2% headwind from FX. We expect both ESS and BSD to grow in the low- to mid-single digit range on an organic basis, supported by the trends we\u2019re seeing in our short-cycle order rates. This is also supported by continued growth in our projects backlog and the service bank in Billing Solutions that we mentioned earlier.","ACS margins are expected to be up approximately 60 basis points with continued benefits from productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, while accelerating investments for growth in new product areas such as connected homes and in high-growth regions.","In PMT sales are expected to be up approximately 2% on an organic basis. The strong and improving growth rates we have seen throughout the year across the PMT portfolio including in Q4 are being temporarily offset by the previously signaled decline in UOP sales for Q4 in the range of 8% to 9%. And to remind you we had an exceptionally strong Q4 2013 for UOP where sales were up 17% organically \u2013 needless to say a difficult comparison. On the other hand, a higher mix of licensing revenue in Q4 will result in a tailwind to UOP and PMT margins.","In HPS the favorable orders and backlog growth will support Q4 sales acceleration which will also carry into 2015. HPS margin expansion will also continue. In Advanced Materials we anticipate another quarter of broad sales growth, however Resins and Chemicals will continue to face lower margin rates exacerbated by planned plant outages and price raw pressures. Overall PMT margins in the quarter are expected to be up approximately 60 basis points versus 2013 driven by UOP and HPS.","Let me move to Slide 9 where I\u2019d like to refresh everyone on our full-year outlook for 2014. As you know we take a conservative view on sales expectations. This approach continues to serve us well because it forces us to also be prudent on our cost structure, so if sales grow better than our conservative expectations we tend to do very well. I think 2014 demonstrates this. Our sales are coming in a little better than where we planned whereas we\u2019ve raised our EPS guidance three times during the year.","As Dave indicated we are taking EPS guidance up a third time, this time to a range of $5.50 to $5.55, up 11% to 12% over 2013 \u2013 so another year of double-digit earnings growth. This is our planning model and we\u2019ll continue to follow it.","As you see on the page we\u2019ve tightened our sales range to $40.3 billion to $40.4 billion, up approximately 3% to 4% versus the prior year. And as for segment margins we\u2019re expecting the full year to be approximately 17% or up 70 basis points over 2013. Again, this puts us at or above the high end of the sales and margin guidance we shared with you last December.","The full year outlook by individual segment is similar to what we shared in July. Considering the performance year-to-date we continue to feel confident in the segment margins for each business \u2013 19.5% for Aero, 15.0% for ACS and 18.0% for PMT: strong performance across the portfolio with every business contributing to the 70 basis points of segment margin expansion. ","While there\u2019s still work to do to ensure we deliver 2014 we have commenced our 2015 planning. On Slides 10 and 11 I\u2019ll walk you through some of our key planning assumptions and initial thoughts by business.","While it\u2019s still early, Slide 10 lays out some of our current views. From a macro perspective we\u2019re not expecting much in terms of macro GDP growth, slightly north of 3%. As I said earlier we continue to be conservative in our planning and 2015 is consistent with that thinking. ","Our short-cycle businesses represent about 55% of our sales and we\u2019re expecting continued growth from new products and technologies in the short cycle. Examples include products derived from our Solstice, Molecules and PMT and our new platform launches in Transportation Systems. Our growth in 2015 will also be supported by continued favorable end market trends, the modest improvement in non-residential spending benefiting both the commercial and industrial businesses, and continued flight hour growth.","On the long-cycle side of our business, which represents the remaining 45% of our sales, we have good visibility into growth in 2015 based on one, the strong order rates; two, our robust backlogs; and three, the capacity from our new plant. We will benefit from the increased oil & gas investments globally, particularly in the downstream markets where the build out continues with both UOP and Process Solutions well positioned for growth.","Aero will also contribute to organic sales growth based on our expectations of a ramp up in new BGA OE platforms and the strong trend of international defense wins. In total, our long-cycle orders and service banks are up single digits for the year which will also drive higher sales in 2015.","So from a total of Honeywell perspective the strength in the US dollar will likely be a minor headwind in 2015. Our large exposure to the Euro is in Transportation Systems where we have locked in for 2015 already. So that will give us a very low sensitivity: if the Euro were to go to say $1.10 we would expect an approximately $0.10 EPS impact for the full year, manageable exposure. And right now we\u2019re at $1.28 but we will keep our eye on it.","Overall the below the line items for 2015 remain stable. Even with the recent investment market slide and the continued low interest rate environment we are currently expecting tension income to be roughly neutral next year and continue to not expect a significant required contribution to any of our plans for the foreseeable future. Finally we anticipate the continued benefits from our proactive restructuring activities to yield $125 million of incremental savings in 2015.","I\u2019m now on Slide 11 which depicts our preliminary growth outlook by business compared to the expected growth in 2014. The colored arrows denote whether we currently see the growth rates improving, remaining steady \u2013 so growth similar to 2014 \u2013 or receding. Again, this assessment is based on our preliminary assessment of the key macro inputs and variables, our current orders and backlog, and the things we\u2019re in control of from an execution perspective.","As you can see there are a lot of green arrows again driven by our great positions in good industries, new product introductions, high-growth region expansion and confidence in our long-cycle backlog. In Aerospace on the commercial side, ATR OE growth is expected to be similar to 2014 but with an improvement in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. This is based on the build rate schedules and ramp up in Airbus A-350 and other new platforms.","In BGA OE we expect the continuation of growth to outpace the market with strong shipments of new engines on new business jet platforms like the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer Legacy 500. We are well positioned in the medium- to large-BGA segments which are expected to grow the most in the next five years.","Dave also referenced earlier our excitement around the launch of the new Gulfstream 500 and 600 platforms, with the first flight of the G500 scheduled in 2015 and shipments starting soon thereafter. We have been working with Gulfstream for some time in developing these products so we don\u2019t expect to incur significant R&D-related expenses relative to these platforms that you normally might expect at the rollout of a new commercial platform. ","These and other new platforms support the continued growth in our ATR and BGA installed base and service businesses. Of course the growth has to be profitable so we also continue to focus on the cost side with planned cost productivity in direct materials and functional spending along with process improvements, which will further support further margin expansion in Aerospace.","The commercial aftermarket sales vary based on the quantity of flight hours and maintenance events, inventory levels, and the customer\u2019s buying and inventory patterns. We would anticipate that sales will grow slightly better than they have in 2014 with an expected improvement in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher engine maintenance events in BGA. ","Defense and Space is expecting a modest sales increase, call it low-single digits, in 2015 based on the strength of the international business which represents about 25% of the portfolio. Our recent win rates support this outlook and we also expect the full sequester to remain in place with the US portion of the business stabilizing.","Finally, Transportation Systems is poised for continued growth in 2015 driven by significant new launches, modestly better European light vehicle production, and the acceleration of gasoline turbo penetration, particularly in the US and China. ","For ACS we\u2019re expecting similar growth and ESS to what we\u2019ve seen through 2014. This growth will be led by new product introductions, further penetration in high-growth regions and continued non-res recovery. As a reminder, roughly 75% of the ACS portfolio serves commercial and industrial markets where we tend to be tied more so to retrofit activity than to new construction. So our portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on improvements in these areas.","In the Commercial Products side we\u2019ve seen modest sales improvement over the course of 2014 which we expect to continue into 2015 with better growth in the US driven by improvement in the ECC and Fire Systems businesses. In the industrial markets we\u2019re expecting higher sales of industrial fire safety equipment, particularly in the Americas which represent about half of our exposure. Residential growth will continue particularly in the US where we\u2019re accelerating our investments in the connected home space. ","And in Building Solutions which is a longer-cycle business, sales growth has been muted year-to-date but we\u2019re encouraged by the improvement in product orders and services backlog, which will benefit in 2015. ","In PMT our robust orders growth and backlog position at both UOP and Process Solutions support growth acceleration. PMT continues to benefit from oil & gas investments occurring around the world. You\u2019re probably aware we\u2019re primarily focused on the midstream and downstream segments. These are less impacted in the near term than the upstream segments might be by any reduction in capital spending that could come from recent crude oil price declines. ","In fact, most of our UOP and HPS backlogs will be executed over the next two or three years and are for projects where the bulk of our customer\u2019s capital has already been spent. The risk of cancellations is low and is already reflected in our initial planning framework. Lower oil prices also mean lower fuel prices at the pump which drive more demand for refined products and production. This also plays to the strength of our portfolio.","Also we\u2019re excited by the recent loosening of US restrictions on energy export and are well positioned to win new business in related verticals, like liquid natural gas. And last, in Advanced Materials we expect to continue to benefit from our Solstice products and higher production volumes in resins and chemicals.","Given the balance of these various dynamics we are encouraged about our prospects for 2015. We are in the middle of our annual planning process and we look forward to providing you with more details regarding our 2015 guidance during our outlook call on December 16th. You can expect it will count on only modest sales growth and will stay conservative on costs so that we deliver earnings growth on a basis consistent with our five-year plan.","Let me wrap up on Slide 12. The strong Q3 results came from every part of Honeywell. We have a solid and diverse portfolio and management team focused on execution. Combined, these enabled us to add to our performance track record as we exceeded our guidance on sales, margins and EPS. With one quarter left to go we are confident in our ability to continue outperforming despite the continued slow growth macro environment.","We\u2019re going to continue investing in our future with a focus on profitable sales growth. This means investing in high ROI CAPEX, in new product development, and in sales and marketing resources particularly in high-growth regions. The investments are paying off \u2013 you can see it in the results.","As we turn our attention to 2015 we recognize the uncertainty in the macro environment but this is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. Also we\u2019re confident that our portfolio is well positioned for continued outperformance. Our order trends, both short- and long-cycle point to accelerated sales growth for next year that should enable continued strong improvements in our profitability. And we will continue to execute to deliver 2014, \u201915, and beyond.","So with that, Elena, let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Elena Doom","Thanks, Tom. Leo, we will now take our first question.","","","Question-and-Answer Session","","","Operator","Very good. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator instructions.) Our first question is coming from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for helping the market go up today. We needed it.","Dave Cote","[laughs] Yeah, I agree.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","I\u2019ve got to give you crap about something, Dave \u2013 you know I can\u2019t go a conference call without criticizing you. But 16 slides and not a word on M&A or buybacks or any cash reinvestment. You\u2019ve had a nice pull back here \u2013 what\u2019s holding you back from buying back some shares?","Dave Cote","Well, first of all I don\u2019t think that we ever provide a chart commenting on that so it\u2019s not unusual.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","No, I know. [laughter]","Dave Cote","I guess 19%, 14% depending upon how you want to look at it doesn\u2019t suffice so I understand. But at the end of the day our strategy\u2019s still the same \u2013 it\u2019s to stay opportunistic on both the M&A side and the share repurchase side, and I think M&A conditions are starting to improve with the kind of pull back we\u2019ve seen. So who knows how things develop, I\u2019m not promising anything. You never know where things are going to go but at the end of the day times are getting better to buy so we\u2019ll see what happens.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","Dave, what is the ideal size of transactions? I mean in the past you\u2019ve done some pretty interesting deals and some of them a little bit big. Would you be willing to go a little larger in size where there\u2019s some value now?","Dave Cote","Well you know, I\u2019ve always said I never say never on doing anything large, so we\u2019ll say I don\u2019t know, $5 billion to $10 billion. But at this date we\u2019ve never done it either \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t but I\u2019ve never done it. We still continue to maintain a very active pipeline of projects from small stuff to big stuff and we\u2019re going to keep doing that, and who knows? Maybe someday something bigger strikes. In the meantime we still keep looking at stuff that\u2019s more bite-size, more manageable. And it\u2019s tough to predict where these things go. As [Ann Madden] keeps reminding us you kiss 100 frogs to find, I guess in my case the princess. So it\u2019s just one of those things that we\u2019re going to keep looking at and keep working.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","And just lastly non-res has been a bit of a mystery this year but it looks like you made some positive commentary there. I mean do you see projects as finally breaking ground where you\u2019ve got some visibility that we can make some shipments? And this quarter was pretty good, actually.","Dave Cote","Yeah, I would say you\u2019ve been hearing me say now for over a year I think that we\u2019ve been seeing increased quote activity but no results from it. We\u2019re finally starting to see some slight improvements in growth rates from what we\u2019ve seen in some of our other businesses. I\u2019d like to think that that portends a trend. I\u2019m not ready to declare that yet but I do believe the time has come. And for me part of this is just the aftermath of the recession. We said at the time how you went in was likely how you were going to come out, and it was stuff that went in quickly, like aircraft spares came out quickly. Stuff that went in slowly like non-res construction has been slow to come out, and I think we\u2019re finally at that point where we\u2019re in the kind of slow-to-come-out range. I don\u2019t expect a boom but I still think it\u2019s going to be a tailwind for us.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays ","Good. Well, well done, guys. Thanks and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Dave Cote","I\u2019m sorry, Scott, what was that? [laughter]","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan ","Hi, good morning. So just on UOP I think people are obviously a little bit worried about what\u2019s happened with oil prices here. Can you maybe just get into specifics on what percentage of UOP specifically is kind of oil price exposed if you will? I mean I know maybe there\u2019s some offshore projects that they may be involved in, FPSOs, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 just want to get some further clarity on that. And I totally understand the positive long-term trends but UOP is obviously one that people worry about every day. So just maybe if you can give us a little bit of color there.","Dave Cote","Steve, the last thing I\u2019d ever expect from you is a bouquet but not even a flower or a rose petal or something? [laughter] Not even a little bit?","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan ","Solid quarter I guess. [laughter]","Dave Cote","Well thank you, I\u2019ll take what I can get.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan ","You\u2019re doing okay. I never worry about you, you\u2019re doing fine.","Dave Cote","[laughs] Here\u2019s a reasonable way to think about it, is if we take a look at our overall sales about 15% of it is represented by oil & gas in total. So it\u2019s not just UOP but it includes Process. If you broke out that 15 points, 12 points of it are in the mid- to downstream segments so yeah, there is some upstream but not a huge amount. And when we think about oil prices, Tom was talking about some of this \u2013 that pump prices tend to be sticky in both directions and when oil prices are going down that\u2019s a good thing for refiners. So all of those projects, especially if the money\u2019s already been spent, we really don\u2019t see it having that much of an impact over the next two or three years. Most of those projects are still going to get done. ","We also think over the long term there\u2019s some natural floors here that exist and there\u2019s been a big increase in oil production over the past year. It\u2019s up something like 3% in total with a big chunk of it driven by the US. But there\u2019s a natural floor that occurs at about $80 when you look at shale oil production where a lot of capacity just goes offline so it gets supply and demand much more balanced. So overall I really don\u2019t see it having that much of an impact to UOP. It might have some; there might be some projects that go a little bit sideways. But overall very manageable is the way I\u2019d think about it.","Tom, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to add?","Tom Szlosek","Just there\u2019s discussion of cancellations and we\u2019ve thoroughly assessed our backlog and we\u2019re really not seeing anything. As Dave said there\u2019s a natural floor, and maybe if you get significantly below that you might see more activity. But the only impacts are minor delays in project financing but it really hasn\u2019t shown any impact on the backlog.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan ","And then Dave, one last question following up on Scott\u2019s question about buybacks: when you think about kind of the reticence to buy stock back at this stage given the prior experience and just worried about buying closer to peak, I mean how do we think about that in terms of your relative valuation and the relative attractiveness of your stock? Because I mean it doesn\u2019t seem like the stock is holding up as well as it should in these pull backs, and so does the mindset change if they\u2019re not giving you \u2013 even though we\u2019re kind of in a tough economic time if people aren\u2019t giving you the relative credit, does the mindset change?","Dave Cote","No, not really. I would say, going back to what I said before we\u2019re going to stay opportunistic. We have a lot of faith in our ability to continue growing and I think we certainly demonstrated that again this quarter. And when it comes to both repurchases and M&A we\u2019re going to stay opportunistic, and having money gives you opportunities. Once the money\u2019s gone the opportunities aren\u2019t there anymore. So we\u2019re going to continue to drive really strong earnings growth especially versus our peers with or without a buyback. And it\u2019s always an opportunity for us.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan ","Great, thanks.","Dave Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Thanks, good morning. It sounds like buybacks are a hot topic this morning. [laughter] So I won\u2019t go there but I do want to switch to the \u201915 framework if you\u2019d like, and thanks for the detail \u2013 it\u2019s really helpful. And I guess the top line will be what it\u2019ll be to what extent by the macro, but as we think about your margin expansion and doing what you can control \u2013 and obviously this year is very strong with a 30-weekish top line year-to-date. But next year, based on the construction pipeline, do you think you can be in line with the 70 bps long-term framework or do you think you can do better than that? Or how should we think about the OM next year?","Dave Cote","Well first of all, Nigel, same thing \u2013 not even a rose petal?","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","No, no, Dave \u2013 great quarter.","Dave Cote","[laughter] Not even a splash of toilet water, something?","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","I\u2019m splashing away here.","Dave Cote","[laughter] Well first off it\u2019s too early for us to declare. We\u2019re in the middle of a planning cycle and we just don\u2019t do that. So in December is when we talk about it, but overall I think you can expect something that\u2019s consistent with our five-year plan because as you recall, in the five-year plan we were pretty conservative on what we expected over five years from the global economy. I guess fortunately and unfortunately \u2013 the fortunate side is we planned for it that way so we\u2019re prepared. The unfortunate part is it\u2019s turning out that way. We kind of hoped that there might be a nice surprise at some point. But we\u2019ll talk a lot more about it in December on Tom\u2019s call. What date is that call?","Tom Szlosek","December 16th.","Dave Cote","December 16th and we\u2019ll talk about it more then. But you can expect something that\u2019s consistent with our five-year plan where you\u2019ll look at it and go \u201cOh, they\u2019re still on track.\u201d ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Okay, that\u2019s fair, thanks Dave. And then one of the real hallmarks of Honeywell over the past decade has been growing top line while keeping fixed costs flat or in some cases down. This year SG&A\u2019s been growing quite a bit ahead of sales and I\u2019m wondering, there\u2019s obviously a lot of moving parts in SG&A and COGS but how much of that increase in SG&A is driven \u2013 and I\u2019m thinking here about initiatives like HUE?","Dave Cote","Well quite honestly I don\u2019t really look at the SG&A line all that much so I should describe it more as how I do look at it. On the sales side we have been adding feet on the street when you look at high-growth regions and that\u2019s one of the reasons that you\u2019re seeing such good performance there, because if you have great products and services and one guy covering a country you\u2019re just not going to sell as much. You\u2019ve got to have somebody who can be out there and represent. I do know on the G&A side, that\u2019s going down because a lot of that is part of our functional transformation \u2013 so you think about Legal, Finance, IT, HR. All that stuff is going down consistent with functional transformation. So all the stuff that we\u2019ve talked about is continuing to happen and I suppose we can get a better SG&A answer for you.","Elena Doom","I\u2019m happy to help out with that.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Okay, thanks. And just a quick one for Tom perhaps: the hedge on TS for next year, I believe that\u2019s new. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve hedged in the past so number one, is that new? And second, is there anything we need to think about in terms of hedge accounting and sensitivity to certain rates?","Dave Cote","You are correct \u2013 it is new. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to discuss further.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s at or around current rates now, Nigel. That\u2019s essentially the way to think of it. So if you think about the current exchange rates for TS it essentially locks us in to what you see. ","Dave Cote","But there\u2019s no mark to market impact.","Tom Szlosek","No, it\u2019s pure hedge accounting. If the mark on the hedge goes to [below translation] or goes below the line outside of operating profits it serves to offset that.","Dave Cote","Because at the end of the day the change in the thought process has been, historically I\u2019ve been pretty adamant about never hedging on translation just because I think over the course of twenty years you\u2019re basically out the cost of hedging. This year I\u2019d say well, there\u2019s always the possibility it could go the other way because these things are unpredictable. The prospects of it going to $1.10, $1.20 I think is very real and we looked at it and said it\u2019s better to say, protect ourselves on half or so of our exposure and forego a bit of that upside just to protect ourselves on the downside in what could be a tougher macro again. And that was the thought process behind it and we were able to do it with a very good understanding of what the impact was month by month. So we were able to avoid having to use that marked to market approach.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley ","Great, thanks guys.","Dave Cote","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker of Bernstein Research. ","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","Hey, thanks, good morning. And Dave, I\u2019m going to save you the pain of soliciting another compliment and just say good quarter to all the guys inside the SBGs, okay? We\u2019ll leave it there.","Dave Cote","Thank you, Steve. As you\u2019ve probably noticed I\u2019m a very needy person.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","I do and as long as that makes you keep delivering I have no problem with that. ","Dave Cote","[laughs] It helps, it helps.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","So a few questions here. I guess one, I hate to keep coming back to the capital deployment but I also remember you often talking about telling investors \u201cNow that we\u2019ve gone through the turnaround some years ago what are we going to do with the cash? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to blow the cash.\u201d To the extent that you are ramping up M&A and Roger\u2019s out there looking pretty aggressively I\u2019m sure as well, what are kind of the minimum financial hurdles we should still think about for kind of mid- to large-size deals that you\u2019re thinking about in terms of return on capital or otherwise \u2013 the stuff that Ann would actually let pass through, for example?","Dave Cote","Our hurdles are not going to change and they\u2019re the same ones that we\u2019ve used for 13 years, and that\u2019s accretive in the second year, IRR clearly above the cost of capital \u2013 so think of it in the 11%, 12% range; and ROI above 10% in the fifth year and that\u2019s all-in, so that includes all the amortization and everything else so it\u2019s a more difficult hurdle than people might think. And at the end of the day regardless of the size we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate 6% to 8% of sales as cost synergies because I don\u2019t want to count on any sales synergies as you know, and I want to make sure that we stay disciplined as hell in terms of our deployment so we\u2019re never going to panic.","And the nice thing about it is we have a terrific organic growth prospect. So it\u2019s not like I have to do M&A in order [deliver] and that\u2019s why we construct our five-year plan the way we do, so that you would look at it and go \u201cGeez, these numbers are awfully good whether they do M&A or not.\u201d But I never want to feel panicked and we don\u2019t. So you can expect that whatever we do, whatever we do end up doing \u2013 whether it\u2019s a bunch of small stuff, something big, various big things depending on how you want to classify it \u2013 it\u2019s all going to meet that criteria.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","Okay. And Tom, a little bit about how you\u2019re starting to think about pension. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll go into more detail in December but given rates, direction and all of that, how should we think about sensitivities in the current accounting structure?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, good question, Steve. If you drew the line today for pension expense considering even the most recent market developments and the low interest rate environment, we\u2019d be about flat year-over-year for pension expense. As I said right now no foreseeable contributions from a cash perspective in the next couple periods. Marked to market-wise for 2014 as you know, if there is one we would do it in Q4. Right now again based on the assumptions as we understand them today, at least for our major plans \u2013 the US plans \u2013 they would not be a marked to market.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","Okay. And if I can just sneak one more in, which is in UOP those CAPEX investments, how do you see those continuing to play out through the next year?","Tom Szlosek","Well in terms of the quantity of the CAPEX, we peak in 2015 in terms of the expenditure level. But as you know starting in the second half of this year we\u2019ve got some of that capacity coming online this year mostly for the Solstice product portfolio and a little bit in the UOP catalyst. But those plants as we\u2019ve said over and over again have pretty much hit the ground running at full capacity and so when you look at the growth rates you\u2019re seeing in PMT, that 7%, that\u2019s a reflection of being able to put that capacity to work right away.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","Okay great, thanks.","Dave Cote","And the projects are on track which is always a great place to be when you\u2019ve got full plants.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research ","Okay, thanks a lot.","Dave Cote","See you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","Good morning. I\u2019ve been brushing up on my accent \u2013 Dave, I think it was a pretty good \u201cquah-tah.\u201d","Dave Cote","[laughs] I think it was wicked good myself.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","[laughs] Just a couple little clean-up things: on UOP can you give us a sense, just following up on that last comment from Tom, what type of top line benefit do you foresee next year as those plants come on? I guess the question is kind of the key noted revenue weight of that capacity as it turns on.","Dave Cote","I would say it\u2019s still a little too early to declare on any of that \u2013 we\u2019ll do more of that in December. I\u2019d say you can expect that UOP\u2019s going to continue to do well.","Elena Doom","And I\u2019d add it\u2019s a big driver for this incremental growth in UOP versus the growth rate we\u2019re seeing in 2014.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","And then on international defense where you\u2019re seeing some acceleration it sounds like, can you give a little color on countries or programs where that\u2019s actually happening?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, Middle East, Israel, Turkey, some of the regions that you might expect to have the funding and where there\u2019s activity; a little bit in India as well.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","And this one might be a little bit in the weeds but kind of getting into fluorines and the like, with your transition coming in the US here really at the beginning of the year do you see any noise in Q4 around that? Do you see signs that people are prebuilding, just anything to be aware of there?","Tom Szlosek","No. I mean we\u2019re really excited about fluorines overall and the transition that we\u2019ve got going, but nothing significant from that perspective.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","Yeah, and then just a quick one and I\u2019ll jump off: Tom, you did end your remarks by saying accelerated organic growth in 2015. Obviously you\u2019ve also hedged the macro and everything but are you suggesting you do have line of sight at least of being inside that 4% to 6% kind of organic growth going forward, which is kind of the compound goal up to 2018?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I think Dave is telling me not to share anything until December 16th, which I\u2019m going to follow my boss\u2019 orders. [laughter]","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research ","Alright, sounds good. Thanks, guys. ","Dave Cote","See you, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America ","Yes, hi, how are you guys? Just to clarify on Advanced Materials, so why is it not growing faster in \u201915 versus \u201914 given this is where the CAPEX is going and Solstice is ramping up? Sorry, and congratulations by the way.","Dave Cote","Ah, thank you \u2013 I thought I was going to have to beg again. ","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America ","No. [laughter]","Elena Doom","So we are seeing good growth in Advanced Materials, Andrew. I mean in the quarter Advanced Materials grew 7% organically so I think what we\u2019re saying is at this point the continuation of that type of mid-single-digit growth rate is what we\u2019re expecting for next year given it\u2019s still early days.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, just a reminder on how to read that chart: the side arrows mean the growth rates themselves for \u201915 compared to the growth rates for 2014. So as Elena points out we\u2019ve seen really decent growth especially in the second half in the Advanced Materials portfolio including fluorine or led by fluorine. So we\u2019re expecting that trend to continue in 2015. So I think it\u2019s a good story.","Dave Cote","Besides if we had a whole page of green arrows you\u2019d be asking how could we possibly believe the environment to be that good.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America ","I appreciate that. And just a comment on BSD, you sort of commented that you\u2019re seeing non-res accelerating. Could you just give more color on what specifically you\u2019re saying, what areas because it would be really good news if we are seeing non-res cycle pickup.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I think it\u2019s been moderate. I don\u2019t want to overplay the pickup on the commercial piece of the non-res but we are seeing a significant amount of quotation activity in the US and particularly on the federal side of the energy vertical. The municipalities and other institutions are also coming along but overall the orders are starting to pick up. We\u2019re expecting good orders, [a story of performance] in Q4 that should serve us well in 2015.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America ","Terrific, thank you.","Dave Cote","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. ","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Good morning. Thank you very much.","Dave Cote","Hey Howard, thank you.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Well no, thank you, Dave. I mean numbers like this, you know, only come from Honeywell.","Dave Cote","Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, Howard, thank you!","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Boy this is really amazing, the suck-ups we\u2019re doing here but anyhow\u2026","Dave Cote","Only if it\u2019s deserved. [laughter]","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Exactly, you know that. But to talk about a couple of business fundamentals, talk about what you\u2019ve done to make Intermec work right. It looks like it had a very nice top line contribution. The US Postal Service piece of business looks like it\u2019s market share pickup and when I walk into Starbucks I see a Honeywell logo. So what\u2019s gone there that\u2019s set you apart because this is a difficult market?","Dave Cote","I was going to say we appreciate you picking up on that one because we\u2019re quite proud of everything we\u2019ve done there, not just by Intermec but by really pulling together several players in the industry and creating a \u201cOne Honeywell\u201d approach that\u2019s really made a difference. And they all brought different technologies and perspectives whether it was Hand-Held, Metrologic or Intermec. ","And I think our guys, starting with Darius the leader originally and then John [Waldren] who\u2019s in there now have done a great job pulling all that together and rationalizing it so that we expanded our offerings, pushed the technology more so than others have, including what we\u2019ve been able to do with Voice or Vocollect coming out of the Intermec acquisition; and getting better coverage \u2013 just being out there and being able to tell our story with feet on the street in a way that we weren\u2019t able to before. So it\u2019s really just a matter of running it better and taking advantage of the technologies that we brought together and running it better.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","So when we look at the Intermec numbers year-on-year they\u2019re up, it\u2019s hard to totally tell but it looks like high single digits. I know that\u2019s only one part of everything you\u2019re doing there.","Tom Szlosek","That\u2019s right, Howard. And I know we\u2019re getting the, as Dave said the technologies are very strong and they\u2019re complementary to what exists in the Scanning Mobility business. We didn\u2019t have printing; we didn\u2019t have voice. We did have mobile computers but Intermec had a very strong platform and so we\u2019ve been able to integrate all three of those product lines nicely and to accelerate the growth there. And as you alluded to the performance against what our expectations were has been tremendous and when we look at the headline multiple versus where we are today it\u2019s quite remarkable.","Dave Cote","It\u2019s also good, Howard, you know how we never count on sales synergies which always provides a nice upside. And we\u2019ve gotten a pile of them here.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Thank you. And then one just final question, sort of I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to ask it right, but as you look at new products that you\u2019re introducing with the R&D spend \u2013 because in each of the business units you\u2019ve talked about there being, I\u2019ll call it growth investments. How are you sort of measuring the premium you\u2019re getting on the new products relative to the spend you\u2019re making? How fast do you decide that gee, this is working really well, let\u2019s put more in; or no, it\u2019s not working very well and let\u2019s scale it back?","Dave Cote","That\u2019s something that we defer to each of the businesses to make those kinds of decisions, and each of them has their kind of kiss-or-kill approach to all of these projects. And some of it\u2019s by country, some of it\u2019s by business so they\u2019re constantly looking at making sure that we get the biggest bang for the R&D buck. And I would say it\u2019s one of the things that I look at and say across the company we still have opportunity for. Sometimes we\u2019ll have a project that we\u2019ll look at and say \u201cGeez, this is going to cause sales to grow 8%, that\u2019s great, let\u2019s do it,\u201d but we really don\u2019t push ourselves because it might be a business that could be growing 20% - we\u2019re just not thinking big enough for it.","On the other side there\u2019s still projects that we linger with too long or we focus on little stuff when we should be conglomerating some of that and focusing on something bigger. So I\u2019d say we do a good job overall, certainly a hell of a lot better than we used to, but I still see more upside to being more disciplined on that in every business.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","Thank you for your help today.","Dave Cote","We hope. We\u2019ll see what 4:00 shows. ","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","[laughs] Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Last but not least, hi guys. So congrats, Dave.","Dave Cote","Oh, thank you.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","You\u2019re welcome. So Tom, you gave us the \u201915 I think restructuring tailwinds of $125 million. Just to try and make sure we have the framework could you tell us what, remind us what your spending expectations are for \u201914 and then savings that would have been from \u201913 and \u201914; and then what you expect to spend in \u201915 that dovetails with the $125 million?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I believe the actual savings from \u201913 to \u201914 is similar \u2013 it\u2019s in that $125 million, $150 million range for 2015. In terms of the cash spend I think for 2014 it\u2019d be about $200 million.","Elena Doom","We had an elevated Q1 restructuring charge obviously with the sale of the B\/E Aero shares. But it\u2019s probably, maybe for just the repositioning portion only it\u2019s maybe more in the $140 million, $150 million range in terms of spend. Tom, do you want to comment on next year?","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, I think for next year I would expect, I mean our unspent backlog as of the end of Q3 is about $350 million, a little less than that. And I would expect that we would spend $150 million to $200 million of that (inaudible).","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s where I was going with the B\/E Aerospace share gains. I mean is this, all else equal are we going to see some sort of a spending tailwind if you will, or absence of spending that could be actually material or impactful? Or perhaps you\u2019re thinking about some other offset because you guys are pretty good at you know, doing some matching opportunistically.","Tom Szlosek","Yeah, so John, I thought you were asking about cash before. ","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well, I was kind of asking about both, yeah.","Tom Szlosek","Okay. So right now as I said our expense, our P&L expense of restructuring is about $120 million and we spent the cash that we had indicated. We\u2019re always looking at opportunities. Every quarter we review with Dave; every business reviews a portfolio of restructuring opportunities just like we do for M&A opportunities. And we look at them in a disciplined way. We look at the paybacks, we look at the ROIs and so forth, and yes, it\u2019s true \u2013 we tend to look for opportunities to fund those restructuring, and yes, it\u2019s also true that we have some potential funding capacity as we look out. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come to any conclusions at this point on what we\u2019re going to do in 2015. We\u2019ll take it opportunistically as we go through the year like we normally do.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s fair. And then can I just follow up: you guys are a very large aerospace company and your commentary around aerospace and aftermarket is still pretty constructive kind of heading into next year. You do have this sort of Ebola thing that\u2019s kind of in the background and I\u2019m trying to understand, would the analogy be perhaps to what happened during SARS and the possible impact on flight hours? I\u2019m just trying to understand at this juncture how are you thinking about the planning process for the business next year as it pertains to flight hours perhaps based on past experience? Or is it should we just not really be concerned about this?","Dave Cote","As usual you can expect us to plan for some of the worst just so that we know what our downside is. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here, though, just based upon what you read about Ebola. In terms of its actual impact on the US in terms of how many people actually get ill, at least from the best I\u2019ve been able to glean, we don\u2019t expect much of an impact there. The thing you can\u2019t predict is what that fear quotient is going to do, and as people just start to become afraid and as media has something new to talk about it\u2019s tough to predict where that will go. So I\u2019d say overall I don\u2019t expect the actual impact in terms of illness to be consistent with what we saw with SARS. You still need to start to factor in what that fear quotient could do and that we\u2019re not really going to know except over the next two to three months I would say. And we\u2019re going to plan, make sure that we have a plan to address it in the most conservative way possible just so that we\u2019re prepared.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks very much, I appreciate it.","Dave Cote","You\u2019re welcome.","Elena Doom","So I want to hand the call back over to Dave Cote for some closing remarks.","Dave Cote","Over the last few years we\u2019d have to say the global macro economy really hasn\u2019t provided much help, and we expect it\u2019s going to continue that way as we outlined in our five-year plan back in March. As Tom and I both mentioned conservative sales planning has been the way to go and we\u2019re going to continue that approach. It\u2019s probably obvious by now that we\u2019re pleased with our outperformance this quarter and this year and for that matter over the last few years, and we intend to continue outperforming consistent with our five-year plan.","Within a slow global economy we will get all the sales we can because of our great positions in good industries, our high-growth region presence and focus, and new products. With that sales growth we\u2019ll continue to drive cost and process discipline through our focus on HOS goals. So said more simply, we intend to continue outperforming.","So thanks for listening and of course thank you to all our owners. I promise we won\u2019t disappoint you, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"10787":["Honeywell International, Inc.

And welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. ","And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Eric. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek. As a reminder, this call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements in this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, share our guidance for the first quarter of 2018, and discuss how the recent US Tax Reform impacts Honeywell. As always, we will leave time for your questions at the end. ","So, with that, let me turn the call over to President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. Honeywell delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with earnings per share of $1.85, enabled by organic sales growth of 6% which reflects a renewed emphasis on the commercial excellence, revitalization of the velocity product development process and the benefits from growth investments. ","In 2017, we expanded our sales force in key regions and businesses and on all our sales teams the newest digital tools that are helping us win in the marketplace. We also revitalized our new product development process to ensure that the products we\u2019re selling are delivering value to our customers.","Our order rates continue to grow and our backlogs are strong as we head into 2018. Cash was a highlight as we generated 4.9 billion of free cash flow in 2017, above the high end of the guidance range. In Q4, we achieved 123% conversion which brought full year conversion to 90% or 109% excluding the effect of pension.","Our efforts to improve working capital discipline are working. While I am encouraged by our progress in this area, there is still significant opportunity, in each of our businesses taking the necessary steps to improve our working capital performance.","Full year earnings per share were $7.11, up 10% year-over-year. This growth excludes the impact of separations cost for spin and charges for the fourth quarter 2016 debt refinancing, pension mark-to-market and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ","Our EPS exceeded the guidance we provided in December driven by 4% organic growth and 70 basis points of margin expansion. ","We also continued to aggressively deploy capital for our shareowners in 2017. We increased our dividend by 12% this year which marked the 8th double-digit increase since 2010. And we bought back $1.6 billion of shares in the fourth quarter and $2.9 billion for the full year. As a company, our total shareowner return was 35% far exceeding the S&P 500 CSR of 22%.","Today, we are raising our full year 2018 EPS guidance to $7.75 to $8 which reflects a lower expected tax rate as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Tom will walk you through the Tax Reform detail later in the call. But I am pleased to announce today that our 2017 performance coupled with the anticipated benefits from this legislation has enabled us to increase our 401(k)-employer match for Honeywell employees in the US. This change represents a sustained long-term commitment to provide enhanced financial security in retirement which we believe is extremely valuable and important to employees. Honeywell remains committed to being an employer of choice.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 3 to highlight a few of our recent commercial successes. In Aerospace, United Airlines selected Honeywell avionics for its new fleet of more than 150 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The flight deck package will include a first ever installment of Honeywell\u2019s SmartRunway and SmartLanding on a Boeing 737 MAX and will feature Honeywell\u2019s integrated multi-mode receiver and IntuVue Weather Radar System which can enable connected radar out of our connected aircraft offering, allowing Honeywell to download weather hazard data and provide pilots and dispatchers immediate information through the GoDirect weather app.","Honeywell solutions work in tandem to greatly improve passenger safety and comfort during takeoff, landing and potentially hazardous weather conditions. We are excited about our continued partnership with United Airlines. ","In Home and Building Technologies, Honeywell designed a new contemporary and state-of-the-art connected home solution and we signed a long-term agreement with ADT, a leading provider of security and automation solutions in United States and Canada to sell it exclusively through ADT's direct and professional dealer network. The solution includes securities, smoke detection, carbon monoxide detection, innovative long range in battery, operate motion viewers and home automation in core price of ADT's and Honeywell's user experience. We are excited to continue our long-term partnership with ADT providing our customers the most innovative products for their connected home. ","In performance matures and technologies, Honeywell process solutions leverage connected plan offerings to position Honeywell as a specialized software and industrial partner, ultimately winning three strategic projects with Kuwait Oil Company to enhance crude production in the Southeast Kuwait fields. Honeywell provides software and services to help KOC Visualize and Optimize the production and operations in the field and will supply an integrated control and safety system based on our experienced PKS and safety manager technology for gathering station. This project enhances the capacity and capability of the existing facility in East Kuwait to manage excess water while keeping crude production at the facility's designated capacity. ","In safety and productivity solutions, we achieved major wins with two global packaged delivery companies to provide more than 100,000 Android based handheld computers that will aid in delivery operations. We're seeing strong adoption of our new Android based offerings and have significant new launches planned for early this year that will drive growth for the productivity products business in the second half of the year. ","A number of these technologies we have in display in our Annual Investor Conference which will take place on February 28 at Honeywell's Headquarters in Morris Plains, Jersey. And looking forward to talking to you more about our progress there. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our financials. ","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks Darius, good morning. I'm on slide 4. As Darius mentioned we achieved 6% organic sales growth this quarter tapping off a very strong year. Our growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2017 starting with 2% in the first quarter. This is a reflection of the investments we've made in the sales organization, the M&A that we've done, our capacity expansions and new product development coupled with an improved economic environment in many of our end markets. ","We generated more than $2 billion in segment profit in the fourth quarter through our continued focus on effective selling and operational excellence. We've experienced strong volumes primarily in aerospace and safety and productivity solutions. Our margin rate increased by 30 basis points and 19.3% stronger than we previewed in December primarily due to stronger than anticipated demand in the air transport and regional aftermarket. ","Earnings per share was a penny better than our preview in December includes a $0.19 contribution from segment profit. Our tax planning actions drove a lower than planned tax rate for the fourth quarter of 16.5%. Now this is before the impact of the tax cuts and Job Act. ","The lower tax rate and lower share count driven by the share repurchase activity Darius mentioned, combined for $0.22 benefit, which was more than offset by restructuring and other progress reported in the quarter, which was a $0.30 headwind. ","We funded $150 million attractive restructuring projects disclosed that will improve our cost structure, drive further productivity and address the potential residual cost that would otherwise results in the upcoming spin transaction. ","On a reported basis, we had a loss per share of $3.18 driven by the impact of the 3.8 billion TCJA charge. That reported loss also includes an 87 million pre-tax pension mark-to-market adjustment from really related to discount rate and 16 million in pre-tax spin related separation costs. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter was very strong at 1.8 billion or 123% conversion or in the early stages of our working capital initiatives, but we\u2019re encouraged by the progress so far and more importantly by the opportunities that we intend to pursue in 2018. Overall, another strong performance with high quality earnings to cap off a great year. ","Let\u2019s turn to slide 5 to discuss our segment results for the fourth quarter. Starting with aerospace sales were up 5% organically, 2 percentage points above the high-end of our sales guidance. In commercial OE, we saw improved air transport deliveries on key platforms including the Airbus A320 and A330 and Boeing 737 and the benefit of lower OEM customer incentives, partially offset by slow demand in business jets as expected. Grocery and aftermarket was stronger than anticipated driven primarily by air transport, repair and overhaul activities and sales of spares in business aviation. ","In defense, we saw continued strength in U.S. core defense driven by spares demand and deliveries on the F-35 and apache platforms. In transformation system we saw robust demand in commercial vehicles across all regions and continued growth in light vehicle gas turbos in China and South Korea. Aerospace margins were up 270 basis points driven primarily by higher volumes, productivity, net of inflation slightly more modest OEM customer incentives and commercial excellence. Aerospace margin performance was well ahead of our expectations.","In home and building technologies organic sales growth was 3% for the quarter. As a reminder, we realigned the smart energy business from HPT into the PMT in the fourth quarter. So, the HPT results for this quarter and going forward now excludes smart energy. Organic growth and products of 2% was driven primarily by the commercial fire business and environmental and energy solutions in Europe. There was continued strength in global distribution particularly in the fire vertical. ","Our businesses in China grew high-single-digits with strengthen all of the HPT businesses. HPT segment margins contracted 40 basis points driven by lower residential security volumes, investments for growth and a different regional mix. ","In performance materials and technologies, sales are up 9% on an organic basis, driven by growth across UOP, process solutions and advanced materials that\u2019s the entire PMT portfolio. In UOP, there was strong demand for our modular equipment, strong initial catalyst loads in the Middle East and significant growth from natural gas project wins at UOP Russell in Russia and in North America.","Growth in the short cycle businesses with an HPS continued to be strong with significant demand for thermal solutions and field instruments. In advance materials, we again achieved double-digit organic sales growth feel primarily by sales this, low global warming refrigerant for mobile air conditioning. PMT segment margins contracted 180 basis points in the quarter primarily driven by the unplanned, plant outage we flagged in November and a different year-over-year mix of sales in UOP. The lower margin performance is also in product due to integration of smart energy, which was not contemplated in our original fourth quarter guidance. ","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 12% on an organic basis exceeding the guidance we provided in October driven by another strong quarter at Intelligrated building on the robust orders and backlog growth throughout 2017. We had a significant increase in retail business sales as our direct selling strategy matured as well as continued strength in China. There was also a robust growth in the safety business as refinery maintenance resumed driving demand for our entire range of safety products and continued strong demand for our legacy sensing controls and workflow solutions, including solutions provided by vocal act and mobilizer. ","The mobility business remains soft though we secured large orders, several large orders for our new Android based products which Darius mentioned. As a result, strong volumes in SPS, margins expanded 140 basis points also exceeding the high end of our guidance, helped further by the benefits from ongoing productivity efforts and from previously funded repositioning. ","I'm now on slide 6. I'll be very brief on this slide as we discuss each of these measures previously. What this slide does is it takes us back to the original 2017 guidance in comparison to the final results. For all categories, the final outcome met or exceeded the original guidance. So, the due matches are say in Honeywells and [indiscernible] also not included on the slide are long cycle orders and backlog. Those results were also impressive each growing double digit in 2017. ","Let's move to slide 7 to discuss the recent U.S. tax reform and its impact on Honeywell's 2018 financials. Honeywell has long been a proponent of corporate tax reform that will enable us to compete more effectively on a global basis and to enjoy efficient and unencumbered movement of our capital. On December 22, as you know, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed. The legislation significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax. By lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The result of the legislation we recorded a $3.8 billion provisional charge in the fourth quarter, comprising of three elements. The first is a mandatory transition tax or deemed repatriation charge on the $20 billion of previously unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. This non-cash charge was recorded entirely in the fourth quarter of 2017, but as we paid over 8-year period in accordance with the legislation. ","The second element is also a non-cash charge, it's a deferred tax liability adjustment favorable in this case to reflect the impact of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate on our deferred tax balances. ","The third element also a non-cash charge is for the implementation of the territorial tax system including holding and local taxes associated with the future repatriation of cash back to the U.S. These taxes will generally be paid as the cash is patriated. This portion of the aggregate charge reflects the tax structures we have in place today as is required by the accounting rules and does not anticipate the benefit we would realize from future tax planning. ","It's only been a month since the tax reform passed and further guidance continues to flow clarifying the legislation. Our accounting reflects our best estimate using the current information we have available to us and the amount of the provisional charge maybe adjusted over the course of 2018 as things become clear. We will update you on the changes if any to the amount of the charge to our effective tax rate and to other provisions of the tax legislation which are material to Honeywell. ","At our upcoming Investor Day, we will also update you more completely on the cash repatriation opportunities that we have as well as on our expectations for the use of those repatriation proceeds. Preliminarily we expect that at least $7 billion of the 10 [technical difficulty] held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated in the next two years. And of course, we will continue to generate overseas cash which will add to that pool of potential repatriation. But there is still expansive tax announces and planning to be done to ensure we execute repatriation in the most efficient manner.","This new global mobility of our cash allows us to continue investing in our businesses in the US, to pay a competitive dividend, to more aggressively seek out M&A, particularly in the US, and to repurchase our own shares. Our preference is for attractive bolt-on acquisitions in our core markets. But to the extent M&A opportunities do not materialize, we will gradually accelerate share repurchases as we did in 2017.","Looking at 2018, as a result of reduction in the US corporate tax rate, our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% versus our normal 25% to 26% historical rate. Given the uncertainty that still remains around the implementation of Tax Reform and the extent of the analysis still to be done, we are conservatively assuming a tax rate of 23%, our guide, which increases our 2018 EPS guidance range by $0.20 to a new range of $7.75 to $8 per share, an increase of 9% to 13% from 2017.","So as Darius and I mentioned we\u2019re pleased with the new legislation, particularly in the mobility of capital and global competitiveness it provides to Honeywell and to our shareholders.","Let\u2019s discuss our expectations for the first quarter on slide 8. We exited the year with strong order rate and from backlogs that we expect will drive a continued acceleration in organic sales growth every quarter in 2018. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 60 basis points driven by volume leverage, commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation, leading to earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.93 or growth of 9% to 13%. This is based on an estimated first quarter tax rate between 22% and 23%.","As we previewed in the December outlook call, the guidance for the first quarter and full year exclude costs related to home and Transportation Systems spin-offs and adjustments if any to the fourth quarter provision for the tax legislation.","Starting with Aerospace, we expect sales to increase in the low single-digit range organically. Our air transport OE business will be impacted by fewer deliveries on Boeing 777 and a decrease in production rate at certain regional OEMs, partially offset by increased A350 deliveries. ","On the business aviation side, we expect organic sales to improve as production rates increase across most of our OEM customers, offset by higher OEM customer incentives. In the after-market, we expect to see strong spare sales with airlines across Americas and Asia Pac and demand in maintenance service plant in business aviation. ","For defense, a very similar story in the recent quarters with growth buoyed by demand in US defense, partially offset by declines in space. In transportation systems, we expect continued light vehicle gas turbo penetration across most of region, particularly in China, North America and Europe as well as continue momentum in the commercial vehicle segment.","And the Home and Building Technology sales will be slightly up. We expect continued strength in Global Distribution, the commercial part of business and our businesses in China. We see improving order pipelines in our main products businesses offset by weaker volumes in residential security in the US.","In building solutions, growth will modest as the robust high growth region activity is offset by slower activity on large installed and service projects in the Americas region. As we progress through our planning for the spin-offs, we have reorganized home and building technologies to better align with how the segment will operate going forward. So instead of showing you results from products and distribution we will start reporting on results in the two new reorganized business units home and buildings. This will be effective when we release first quarter earnings. ","Moving to performance materials and technology, sales are expected to be up low to mid-single-digit on an organic basis driven by continued conversion of our strong backlog. Entering 2018, PMT loan cycle backlogs are up 8% from 2017. In process solutions, we also expect continued demand for our short cycle software and service offerings and field and instrumentation products. In UOP, we expect significant catalyst deliveries for new units in China, as well as sustained equipment and engineering growth. [Indiscernible] growth and advanced materials is expected to continue. Although, there are tougher year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter. ","Finally, in safety and productivity solutions we expect sales in the mid-single-digit range organically driven primarily by large project wins at Intelligrated and strong orders demand exiting the year in sensing and IoT and workflow solutions including for mobilizers cloud service application. ","In safety, we expect growth across the gas vertical in China and all lines of business in the Americas as a result of our new product launches, sales investments and improved market conditions. We also expect improvement in the retail business. On a regional basis, the SPS China business is expected to grow more than 10% driven by sensing in IoT, safety and productivity products in the region.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 9, I want to talk about a revised full year guidance. We\u2019ve updated our full year margin guidance to reflect our stronger than expected performance in 2017. Full year second margin is now expected to be between 19.3% and 19.6%. This reflects 30 to 60 basis points expansion, which is consistent with what we said in December. These segments had been updated accordingly. ","We\u2019ve also updated our earnings per share guidance as Darius mentioned reflect a lower anticipated full year effective tax rate between 22% and 23% due to the tax legislation. Full year EPS is now expected to be $7.75 to $8, up 9% to 13% year-over-year excluding separation costs to fourth quarter 2017 charge related to the tax reform and any 2018 adjustments for that charge. ","I am going to wrap up on slide 10. Fourth quarter was an outstanding finish to 2017. We achieved strong sales growth, continued margin expansion double-digit earnings growth and exceptional free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we continued on our aggressive capital deployment with more than a 1.5 billion in share repurchases in the quarter and $2.9 billion for the full year. We also funded more than $350 million in restructuring in 2017, which is helping us to proactively address standard costs ahead of our two-plant spin-off. Those spin-offs remain on track for completion by the end of this year. ","We\u2019re also pleased with the passage of U.S. tax reform and we raised our 2018 EPS guidance by $0.20 as a result. We believe that the tax reform will provide a sustainable long-term benefit to Honeywell, not a single quick hit. In the same light, we believe that the benefit that we share with our work associate should also be a sustainable long-term benefit, so we\u2019ve chosen an ongoing mechanism, it will benefit and now and in the years to come throughout their retirement. That is an increase for the employee matching contribution in our U.S. 401(k) plan. Our strong order rates and increased backlog heading into 2018 give us confidence in our first quarter guidance. We\u2019re well positioned for continued outperformance in 2018. ","With that, Mark. Let's move to Q&A. ","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are now available for answering your questions. So, Gary if you could please open the line for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple of things. First, I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more aero margin it was very strong. Was there any unusual timing and incentives or program close outs or anything like that? First question. ","Darius Adamczyk","I wouldn't say there is anything unusual. We obviously had a very favorable mix as reflected by the commercial aftermarket. And that was probably a little bit even more favorable than we had anticipated. But I wouldn\u2019t say there is any kind of onetime charges other than the impact of a more favorable mix of business than we had originally projected. That's really the function. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah you might be thinking about an incentive comp Jeff. But the 270-basis points expansion most of that was the combination of the volume mix and productivity that we generated. I think the incentives were probably 0.5 of the 270, so small piece of that.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, great. And then just to trying to kind of wrap up just the cash flow outlook overall. Could you just update us on what you're thinking about CapEx as pension income moved around at all here at year-end? And does the outlook you anticipate any additional share repurchase in 2018 at this point?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I mean starting with the CapEx, Jeff. I mean we've been peaking in 14 to 16 north of $1.1 billion or so. That will be down in the $900 million range or less in 2018 and will continue to go down. We've got continued emphasis on our working capital, hoping to get another half a point of working capital terms. [Indiscernible] toolset is helping us with that. ","On pensions, the plan is at the end of the year was funded close to 105%, right now it's funded probably 110% or more. So those assets are driving more income if you can believe that. But from a cash perspective it is non-event with the plants fully funded, there are no contributions for the foreseeable future we think that's in pretty good shape. And we'll continue to drive the conversion. I mean our cash conversion in 2016 was 86%. We told you we're trying to move towards a 100%, we hit 90% in 2017. And we think prospects are good to drive that further in '18. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah. And Jeff it's kind of reflected in the cash guidance for 2018. I think even if you only take this midpoint of our guidance it\u2019s a fairly healthy increase and as we discussed at length last year, we're going to continue to make progress on cash generation and cash conversion. Just like we showed in 2017, we've reached magical 90% level and that\u2019s kind of where we want as a starting point. ","Jeff Sprague","Great. And share repurchase, and I\u2019ll cede the floor. Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and share repurchase Jeff, right now, the plan is to do what we normally do as I said. So, we will be offsetting any dilution that comes up as a result of option exercises and contributions of employee benefit plans. But as I also talked about on the repatriation, there\u2019s an opportunity materializing and the timing is -- needs to be further analyzed. ","Our priorities overall remain the same and we prefer to prioritize bolt-on acquisitions that can be accretive to our businesses. But like in 2017 when the market was a bit more frothy for us in terms of opportunities we chose to deploy it towards share repurchase we did, a 1.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, 2.9 billion for the full year. And we were able to take the share count down for the year over 2%. So that\u2019s the kind of approach that we\u2019ll continue to head into the year with.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch ","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, guys. So, can we start with the core volumes, so you gave the update on December 13th, Tom you thought core growth will be 7 to 8, it\u2019s 6. But your numbers are solid with great cash flow. And I guess my question is, did something happen at the end of the year like with December normally at the very end, cause the core growth expectations to shift lower kind of by 1.5?","Thomas Szlosek","No, I mean as you can imagine fourth quarter is a big volume quarter for our businesses. Aerospace in particular, you have a lot of OEM customers and we\u2019re kind of partnering with them to meet their delivery schedules. Those change. And sometimes they -- their deliveries push out which was the case for Aerospace, most of that slight moderation of growth rate was due to Aerospace OEM. But as you saw the growth in aero and Honeywell for the fourth quarter organically was still very strong and we had better mix in Aerospace at the after-market as I said.","John Inch ","Yes, so aero was the primary factor then, that's the message.","Thomas Szlosek","A little bit in -- look, a little bit in PMT as well, lower margin stuff in PMT. But no trends per say, more binary kinds of things either large transactions in most cases.","John Inch ","The shift from Windows to Android, you guys have called out increasing traction right in terms of orders, how does that dynamic work? Are you still selling the Windows based products, you have to write-down inventory, what\u2019s actually going on here? I am trying to understand how that prospectively impacts the financials probably in your margins I am assuming in 2018 for that segment?","Thomas Szlosek","Yes, I mean we\u2019re selling both types of products, and as a matter of fact. The majority of the installed based in productivity products is still most of the software is still written in Windows based code. So, we foresee continuing robust sales on the Windows product offering. But as we discussed on multiple calls, last year, Android is becoming a much more prominent part of our portfolio offering. We have launched some new products in Q4. We launched some in Q2. And then we have a pretty big launch coming up here also in Q1. The great news for us as we highlighted in the announcement is we\u2019ve already secured some major wins with these new offerings that are Android based. So, it gives me a lot more confidence around the future of the products business. But rest assured Microsoft page mobility offerings, we\u2019re still selling those fairly aggressively and they still make-up more than 50% of our sales. ","John Inch ","And is the customer Darius, right that incurs, if they want to shift from Windows to Android, it's their problem, it's not as if Honeywell is somehow on the hook to pay migration costs or something like that. Right?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. Exactly. They have to convert their software from Microsoft based to Android based. And we\u2019re offering our customers a choice, some of them are making that conversion others are maintaining their current platforms. ","John Inch ","And cash was very strong in the fourth quarter despite obviously the business putting up very robust growth. How do you manage the \u201918 cash in terms of growth and acceleration in the economy and the demands in working capital, but then trying to get working out of the system? I guess, I understand you want to keep a conservative guide, but do you think there is upside to cash given the backdrop of kind of macro improvement or was do a little bit of anomaly in the fourth quarter given how strong it was?","Darius Adamczyk","John, I\u2019m going to optimist. So, I always believe there is upside, but I think there is a couple of factors going first. Number first is working capital has been a point of emphasis, we saw, we had our senior leadership meeting shake-up already in January and I can tell you, it was one of the two major, major highlights that we talk about. Number two is Tom talked about the reduction in CapEx and I think it\u2019s important to note we\u2019re not constraining CapEx, it\u2019s just that we have gone through a fairly substantial investment cycle. And we just see that waning a bit, but if we see great projects we\u2019re going to continue to invest. But nevertheless, we anticipate that CapEx never being lower this year and even potentially next year. ","And then three is just it will be, we\u2019re looking at all these working capital levers and all the businesses have, what I called pretty aggressive targets in terms of working capital. But then also last thing to add is, we\u2019re still assessing a lot of these moving pieces when it comes to the new tax legislation. Particularly as it relates to cash taxes, because as you know, we have kind of 8 years to payback, that one-time fee. So that\u2019s offset somewhat by the reduction. So, we still had some work to do in terms of the overall impact for the year and Tom and and his team have been working through all those details. ","John Inch ","Got it. One last one, as inflation Darius, comes back into the U.S. economy, how are you thinking about managing the company in terms of say pricing, the trade-up between pricing and costs that sort of thing?","Darius Adamczyk","No. That\u2019s a good question, because that can be a very, very dangerous phenomenon. I can tell you that every one of the SPGs and that\u2019s something we already implemented last year, they\u2019re really watching their inflation in the impact on their product costs. And I am very confident in saying that all of our businesses have a very good process to monitor that inflation of products and making sure that they\u2019re passing that through to the marketplace. And frankly, the inflationary environment for our goods, it\u2019s not new, it\u2019s really been in place last year as well, particularly in second half. So, we\u2019ve been watching that one carefully and for the processes in to make sure that we monitor proactively. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","So just to follow up on John's question on cash flow just to be clear. You raised your net income guidance to reflect the tax rate but you are basically not raising the cash number because of the uncertainties around the cash going out the door on the transition. Is that kind of how we should read the lack of guide on raise on free cash?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. I mean our original guide that we gave you in December Steve was under the provides [ph] of the old law. And every year we anticipate some cash benefit from the tax planning that we do. In fact, in 2017 we did realize some benefits there. So, it's not as this we had just taken the -- put off the breaks on tax planning and the cash management around tax planning in that original guide. ","When you look at 2018, there will be some benefit certainly on the U.S. side from that lower cash tax rate. But it's offset by the payment of the mandatory toll charge. And we need to continue to study the developments in legislation before we step out and say it's going to be a huge impact. I mean the guide range that we gave was fairly wide in any case from 5.2 to 5.9. So, I think we're still comfortable this early point sticking to that range. ","As you know we had substantial overseas cash and retained earnings. So at least for the next 8 years that is going to be a bit of a cash drag because we got to take that onetime tax hit.","Steve Tusa","Yeah okay. And just on the EPS guide. A little bit of a higher kind of operating base and you guys clearly beat up [ph] this quarter. I think you tweaked up your margin assumptions yet you are and I think share count is coming out a little bit lower than we expected exiting the year. You're only waiting for the incremental tax benefits. Is there something else that's kind of below the line or anything else we have to be aware of, anything you're concerned about that has slowed down as to why the raise wasn't a flow a little more through there? Or just building a little bit more contingency and hedging in the plan?","Darius Adamczyk","So, I think not a lot has changed since December. I mean we actually expected a more robust fourth quarter as we said earlier from a top-line perspective. And so overall, the momentum in each of the businesses is strong and we expect that to continue. And maybe there will be some upside on the top-line, but in terms of things that we're -- the large things that we're concerned with we haven't articulated, there is nothing about source here. Most of the assumptions we talked about in December are still intact. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah and Steve just to maybe to add on to it. I mean first of all as you know 60% of our business is short cycle versus longer cycle. And we're in New Year [ph] so it's I think only on the year it's best to be prudent and just really a little bit more on the caution side to really see how the business evolves. ","But having said that I can tell you that I'm a lot more bullish on the year heading '17 into '18 versus '16 into '17. I think the comps are a little bit tougher. But nevertheless, as I look across the entire business portfolio, I can't think of a single business where I would view as a down arrow versus '17. So overall things look good. But we have to see and see that the business materializes and comes through on the P&L, I think first quarter we will see how things go and after that we\u2019ll back to discuss it with you and see what adjustments we need to make for the year.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last one in you March investor meeting, can you just may be described -- not what the targets are going to be, but are you going to give kind of a refreshed longer-term view financially? Just asking about kind of framework and format, how you guys are going to approach that?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean I kind of feel like I did that last year, kind of the low to mid-single-digit, 30 to 50 that kind of range. I think we\u2019ll probably -- just to give you a little bit of a preview, I think you should expect to see something in that similar range going forward. But yes, we will give a refresh on that outlook. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be as precise as laying out every year because you\u2019re not going to get out four, five years, I think it\u2019s a little bit more unknown and we go through a recession or something you end up kind of not looking so smart. But I think the kind of framework that provided last year\u2019s margin will be kind of should be your expectation for this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. ","Steven Winoker","Hi, thanks. And good morning, guys. Close enough, right, I\u2019ve been called worse things. So, Darius, may be just talk a little bit about the key messages and the difference for managers, the HS element, the leadership meeting that you just had, I know you mentioned CAD. But just a little more on sort of how you\u2019re kind of trying to steer the ship and give folks priorities as they think about 2018?","Darius Adamczyk","No, first of all, the key message was that I thank them for a really nice 2017. I think we had a very nice year across the board and I think it was a good time to recognize the kind of outstanding effort that the team contributed. So that was sort of first key message. ","In terms of priorities for 2018, I\u2019d say two or threefold. Number one, working capital, I talked about that. We want to drive free cash flow. We want to drive free cash flow conversion. I just want to emphasize too that this is sort of where a very healthy and well-funded pension plan is actually hurting us from a cash flow conversion perspective. And I always emphasized that because somehow, it\u2019s forgotten. ","The second point is software and software not just in our connected enterprise, in our connected -- but really the incorporation of software into anything and everything we do. So, software and the sensors strategy for any and all products that Honeywell launches. ","And the third one was much more about innovation, making sure that we leverage the latest and greatest technologies are available in the marketplace today, and making sure that those are reflected in our NPD pipelines and so on. ","And then the last one is that we kind of had a bit of a -- we have different behaviors that we\u2019re trying to incorporate in the company and reemphasize leveraging and exhibiting those behaviors in everything we do. ","So those were some of the key messages from our senior leadership meeting.","Steven Winoker","That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, as you think about the kind of follow-on effects of Tax Reform for your customer base and their decisions about how to spend that money and whether or not that kind of works its way back to your own growth rate and your own decisions even. What -- I am really seeing kind of the mixed messages out there from corporate in terms of what they see in their own customer base kind of considering additional spending that\u2019s just sort of macro related versus maybe tax related and not sort it matters. But maybe a few thoughts on that, it\u2019s potential for acceleration?","Darius Adamczyk","I think for us undoubtedly, this is a very constructive outcome, I mean we were supportive of tax reform, we\u2019re very pleased with what ended up happening, I think it\u2019s going to be good for U.S. business. For us, certainly see a much greater level bullishness on the part of our customers, which should translate to continued investment. And you\u2019re right, their CapEx is our revenue and we do expect some level of investments to accelerate. ","Now, I think it\u2019s a little bit early and I think we sometimes forget that the details of this are still becoming clear, it\u2019s only 30 days old and what the implications are for us. I mean for us, we\u2019ve been bullishly investing in the U.S. already. I mean, if you think about our elevated CapEx that\u2019s been in place for the last two to three years, a lot of that investment went into manufacturing jobs, particularly states like Louisiana and others. ","In addition, we\u2019re aggressively hiring a lot of software engineers, particularly in our Atlanta COE and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So, we haven\u2019t and we\u2019ll continue invest in the U.S. Now this is longer term as we assess further investments with this, does this make U.S. more appealing place to invest? Absolutely, we think that this makes the U.S. a much more appealing place to invest and as we may contemplate further investment. U.S. will be near the top of the list. ","Thomas Szlosek","Just add a little color on that. When you look at the momentum that we have in the U.S., overall, we closed the year 3% organic growth or so in region. But it was the fourth quarter that was pushing close to double-digit. So, I think there was some anticipation of what was coming possibly and we\u2019ll see how that goes. I mean so far, so good at this early point and in January as we look forward. But it\u2019s hard to make that direct connection between the benefits from the legislation including expensing in the CapEx and our order rates, but we\u2019re looking forward for sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","We know you have more difficult growth comparison scenario moving forward. But you did 5% growth in 4Q and you averaged over four in the second half of the year. We heard some more positive commentary on business jets, you guys have talked about potential turn for the end of this year and next year. So how do you look at the business at this point is. The 1 to 3, I am sure there is some conservatism for the usual suspects like space and maybe TS. But is the overall environment actually still getting better would you say and ask this?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I think as we discussed, we think the environment is still getting better. But I think what is also important to know is that, we\u2019re coming off a much stronger year \u201917 than a weaker year, which is \u201916. So all-in-all, we\u2019re still very bullish and I\u2019m very excited about our prospects, more excited than going into \u201917. But nevertheless, the baseline is a little bit different in terms of specific for your question on aerospace. Yes, I think the framework there on the business jets is similar to we\u2019ve been saying. We expect some level of acceleration, but more likely in the second half of \u201918 not early, particularly some of the new platforms we're launching and deliveries taking place. So that's a cautious optimism reflected in the growth rates for probably more later rather than sooner given the year. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Appreciate that. And then you mentioned that you're seeing short cycle growth in profit solutions. In December you suggested you really haven't seen any evidence of bigger projects coming back. But you guys say the same thing that we do tax reform and [indiscernible] being very high. Do you have any implication that larger projects could begin to come back, are you seeing any signs of them yet as you sit here today?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. I mean I think overall, our pipelines are very strong. I think you have to remember that our PMT backlog is up 10% on a year-over-year basis. And we had positive orders growth in both UOP and HPS in Q4. But I would tell you also the pipeline and the project pipeline are strong. And I think what's important in terms of the price of oil is sustainability is that we don't like to see is it bouncing around. So, to the extent that it stays at this level is right around is a very healthy environment for investment. So as long as this is sustained I become that much more bullish on our outlook in PMT particularly UOP and HPS. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. ","Scott Davis","I asked this question a couple other corps, I haven't really gotten an answer that seems helpful yet. And I'll throw to you guys, I mean this new Tax Act thing, seems to have somewhat made it simpler to do tax planning globally. That maybe creates an opportunity for you guys unwind some structures that were created in the past that whether it's supply chain related or otherwise. Is there a cost benefit at all from the simplification? I mean you guys probably have like 700 different corporate entities something crazy like that right. So is there any chance you can unwind some that stuff.","Darius Adamczyk","That\u2019s an inside information now. Scott, I think it's funny. You can see us in the room I am actually smiling at [indiscernible] Because that's actually -- I think your point is spot on. I mean I think -- what I think is underestimated today's is there is an opportunity to simplify a lot of our legal entities. That is an effort that actually we've already launched and is leading that effort. But I also think that something has underestimated the level of complexity in this new tax structure in terms of versus where we're going versus where we are today. So, I applaud the new tax code and we think it's extremely helpful for U.S. business. But it will require us to restructure ourselves and we do believe that new structure long term will be simplified, will cost us less, will make a lot easier to do business. Can I quantify that for you right now? I can't. because we literally just started out work a couple of weeks ago. But I do anticipate there will be a source of value for Honeywell and our shareholders.","Scott Davis","Okay good. That's the only good answer I've gotten so far. So, thanks for that. I wanted to ask about business jets in the context of this tax act too. And then you know the money is coming back and it doesn't seem like anybody has brought a business jet in a while. I mean you guys have always had really good forecasters, who were known for long time as being the best source for the business jet forecast. What are your guides saying and if you on this earlier, and I missed it, when I went out for coffee sorry? But what are you guide saying as far as the potential impact on guys having a few extra bucks around buying some planes?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think probably the right answer is, it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell because we would like to see that reflected in kind of the order rates on the part of our business jet customers. But one would have to believe that this should have a positive impact on the overall demand. I think from now we are kind of sticking what we said before is that we anticipate some uptick in the second half of this year and stronger environment in 2019. But like I said I think it\u2019s just a little bit too early to tell the real impact, the new tax code is 30 days old and difficult to project at this point the impact it has. But sort of logically tell you, it should be an up arrow for us. ","Thomas Szlosek","Yes, the only other thing we have going with is the mandates and some of the software after-market offerings that we do on the business jet side. So, we might not be clicking away at the double-digits, we certainly are getting new technology investments for existing platforms.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions. First, I just wanted to ask, given Tax Reform, how does it change if at all the profile of the types of acquisitions you are looking at? Does it encourage you to go bigger? Does it do anything to the criteria that you\u2019ve set out earlier?","Thomas Szlosek","I don\u2019t know if that dramatically changes it. I think given what our -- may be the only thing that\u2019s certainly very helpful for us is the ability to bring back some more cash in the US, it certainly makes US based acquisitions a bit easier to execute because now we have got more access to cash. But in terms of focus or I think our financial metrics are set up such that the hurdles are that --- adjustment in the tax rates will be reflected in the financial metrics we look at. So, does it dramatically change the calculus? I am not sure. Other than we will have more fire power in the US, which is important and it\u2019s important to have that kind of flexibility. ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I would add to that though that we have not really been constrained in where we\u2019re looking like, our M&A team and the businesses haven\u2019t been saying well let\u2019s not look into US as we don\u2019t have cash as we\u2019ve always able to accommodate that with our capital structure and that will be -- continue to be the case even more so now.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And I appreciate that. And just one follow-up. Darius, how do you keep the potential spin curves [ph] kind of focused ahead of a spend, what kind of -- just to make sure that everyone keeps running the bond [ph], I think as distracted as they move into that -- into the new world on the run? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean I think both through sort of our attention, we do these -- as our business before and after the spin, I mean we want to make sure that these are incredibly successful. We have very focused management teams in both the spins businesses. They are doing a great job in running their businesses but also getting ready for the spins. I am very confident that the teams in those businesses are focused on delivering now, and after the spins take place. So, I think there is also proper incentives that are aligned to the success before and after the spin is well, which we have taken care of and put in place.","Thomas Szlosek","Gautam, this is not an effort that\u2019s being done in some far-flung part of the company. The team, the spin code team is executing on the transactions, actually reports into Darius and I directly. We do involve the business as being spun. But we want them focused for the most part on executing on their operating plans. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve structured. The 2 objectives of the spin team are, one, day 1 readiness for those organizations and we have a very strong cadence and operating system around that in terms of systems, in terms of people and staffing and doing all the regulatory filings and so forth. So that\u2019s very rigorous. ","Secondly, its stranded costs, and with 20% of the revenues from the remain co [ph] going with the spin, we need to right size the company. And so that SpinCo leadership team also is in the process of managing that cost structure. So, Darius and I get regular weekly visibility to it. We put on some of the most senior people in Honeywell to do this and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making. ","Darius Adamczyk","And I think just add to it, we have a full blown, what we call de-integration team, which is staffed by senior leaders, whose full-time job is nothing, but the focus on making certain that we have a successful spin in place and execute the business in the near-term. So, we have the right level of focus on this. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. ","Peter Arment ","Just a quick one, sticking on the aerospace. Obviously, the United Airlines selection was certainly very favorable for you guys. But just kind of talking about the competitive landscape. We\u2019re months into this deal with one of your bigger competitors, certainly the headline reads that it would be more competition for you. But at the same time, seems like there is going to be a lot of opportunity. What are you guys hearing in terms of your sense of post this merger that you will see other opportunities for growth?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I mean, Peter, we haven\u2019t been really focused on the merger of others, I think what we\u2019re really been focused on is executing our strategy. I continue to be extraordinarily excited about our division for connected aircraft. I think it\u2019s been just relating, it\u2019s reflected in our rates, certainly been a factor in the United win, and we\u2019re getting more and more traction every day. And I feel good, because we have. If you think about the real estate in the scope on an aircraft, we have the avionics, and we have the mechanical systems and we have an integrate plan and integrate our offering. I think we have a very compelling vision for the kind of value we can create for aircraft owners, maintainers, passengers, pilots, create a more efficient, more safe experience for everybody. And that\u2019s not visionary, that\u2019s not a dream. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re executing, selling and generating revenue in today. And we feel that\u2019s a very unique place to be in the aerospace industry and frankly we are the only ones that are executing it. I think probably our biggest opportunity or challenge at the same time is just being able to communicate that clearly and add value to end customers. But as you can tell by some of these wins, we\u2019re doing that more and more effectively. ","Peter Arment ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And just a quick one Tom, on the sensitivity around for your defense business with the CR impacts. How do we think about that? Is there any near-term impact or what's the right way to think?","Darius Adamczyk","Well thankfully we got another reprieve. It's kind of one of those things that\u2019s more timing than anything else. There is a slight risk at volumes pushout depending on shutdown and so forth. But I think we're -- I don't think we are anticipating any significant adverse impacts from those activities. ","Operator","And our final question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin","Hey. Just a question, the focus on economy was all in the U.S. but European macro metrics actually looking better than the U.S. right now so is China. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing in Europe and what you guys are seeing in China and other emerging markets? And specifically, on China, if you're seeing any signs of deceleration? We have getting a lot of questions from investors on that?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. We're extremely bullish on China. It was an absolutely terrific year for us in China. Being close to 30% organic growth rate in China last year and it could be a slight down tick from that rate maybe. But we continue to see double digit and planning on double digit growth rate in China for us. So, we're bullish there, and that was every business. Every business grew and I think really kind of figured out the calculus as to how to be successful in China, acting like a local company. Our whole value chain now is localized. And the great news and the one that I'm really excited about is we make similar progress in India. So, I think we're really firing on all cylinders in China and India. Back to your Europe question, we're also bullish on Europe. Europe it's continued to grow we're seeing growth in Western Europe not seeing a lot of trouble spots here. So, as we head into '18 as I said, I continue to be bullish on a global basis in terms of our prospects for growth. So overall strong environment. ","Andrew Obin","And just to follow up on your Aero '18 outlook. You said on the call that none of your businesses are going to be negative but just sort of these one to three growths does imply that perhaps commercial OE is negative on the wide body deliveries. How should I think about sort of subsegments within Aero?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I think number one is that aftermarket in the services business are going to continue to be strong both through sort of what I call the proactive segment as well as the great fix. We talked about the business jet OE which is -- our plan is that as acceleration as we get deeper into the year. And on the narrow bodies, obviously this is going to be really aggressive growth for our customers. so that's sort of a rough framework that we're planning for in 2018.","Andrew Obin","So not all of that within your framework, not all the subsegments are negative into '18?","Darius Adamczyk","No. And on the OE side, we'll continue low-single digit kind of growth all in. is the plan. I mean that could change quarter-to-quarter and very quarter-on-quarter based on customer delivery schedules. But I think we're planning on an overall commercial OE growth rate in that range. ","Andrew Obin","So just similar level conservatism across your guidance. Thanks. ","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. We\u2019ve begun 2018 with significant momentum including strong order rates, a growing backlog and favorable US tax legislation. We are excited by our prospects both in near term and long-term as Honeywell continue to outperform. I am looking forward to speaking to you next at our annual investor conference on February 19th here in Morris Plains. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.","Note that elements in this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","For this call, references to earnings per share, free cash flow and effective tax rate exclude impacts from separation cost related to the upcoming spin-off of our Homes and Transportation Systems business along with recent tax legislation.","This morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the second quarter, and provide an update to our 2018 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. So with that, let me turn the call over to President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell had a very strong start to 2018 with first quarter earnings per share of $1.95, up 14% year-over-year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by $0.02.","Our earnings this quarter were driven by organic sales growth of 5%. The growth was strong across the portfolio, particularly in Aerospace, SPS, warehouse automation and the PMT process automation businesses. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. Our long-cycle orders were up 35% and our long-cycle backlog was up double-digits, with particular strength in Intelligrated, Aerospace and UOP. I will touch on our revised full-year guidance in a minute.","Operational performance was also strong as evidenced by the 40 basis points of margin expansion and nearly 30% growth in free cash flow. We benefitted from our continued investments in Commercial Excellence, together with mature productivity and volume leverage. The margin expansion is within our guide and in line with our long-term target of 30 to 50 basis points expansion per year.","Free cash flow in the quarter is about $1 billion. The 30% growth follows an exceptionally strong first quarter of 2017, where free cash flow was up more than 500%, so the cash performance is even more noteworthy. And yet, we believe there is even more improvement ahead, driven by our company-wide initiative on cash and working capital.","Finally on Q1, we continue to aggressively deploy capital, repurchasing nearly $950 million in Honeywell shares. We are also tracking well with the cash repatriation plan we reviewed at our Investor Day in February, which contemplate more than $4 billion of cash being repatriated in 2018.","Today, we are raising our full year 2018 organic sales growth guidance to a new range of 3% to 5%, our EPS guidance to a new range of $7.85 to $8.05, and our free cash flow guidance by $100 million. Compared to prior range, our EPS guidance is now $0.10 higher at the low-end and $0.05 higher at the high-end. These changes reflect both our exceptional first quarter performance and our confidence in our company's ability to continue outperforming for the remainder of 2018.","Our end-markets are strong. We are experiencing robust commercial activity. We are executing well. It's evidenced by our margin and cash performance. We have significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. In summary, an exciting start that we expect to be a very strong year.","Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent news from our businesses.","In Aerospace, we signed three contracts with Singapore Airlines group to provide the latest Honeywell technologies and solutions to help improve operational capabilities for Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot. The agreements include a variety of services and equipment, including weather radar, navigation systems, auxiliary power units, predictive maintenance technologies, and our 24\/7 engineering and maintenance support.","Additionally, Singapore Airlines group and Honeywell signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly work to implement Honeywell's Connected Aircraft technologies to reduce operational risk, improve efficiency and maximize aircraft performance. As a result of the agreement, the family of airlines will receive better and more predictive maintenance services that will reduce mechanical delays in cancellations. And through connectivity and then analytics flying will be more efficient and cost effective.","We are seeing significant demand for our customers for connected aircraft offerings and we continue to lead the industry when it comes to innovation in this area. In Home and Building technologies we launched INNCOM e7 Thermostat for hotels, a new connected building offer. This is the first enterprise-grade environmental control and energy management solution that incorporates Amazon's Alexa voice control for temperature, lighting, drapery, and amenity functions.","Honeywell's INNCOM hospitality solutions are used more than 1.5 million guestrooms around the world. In Performance Materials and Technologies, we introduced a cloud-based simulation tool that uses a combination of augmented reality and virtual reality to train plant personnel and critical industrial work activities. With more than 50% of the oil and gas workforce due to retire within the next five years, the Honeywell Connected Plant Skills Insight Immersive Competency tool is designed to bring new industrial workers up to speed quickly by enhancing training and delivering it in new and contemporary ways.","An upstream oil and gas customer in Europe is already using this solution to improve the productivity and skill-set of its employees. In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we launched the Dolphin CN80 ultrarugged handheld computer for demanding environments such as distribution center and parcel delivery. The CN80 is the latest device to run our Honeywell's Android-based Mobility Edge platform, which is composed of common software and hardware architecture and a suite of device tools.","The scalable architecture allows customers to develop, test and certify an application just once before deploying it to multiple device types across the enterprise, allowing companies to accelerate deployments, optimize device performance, and extend the total product life cycle with the objective of lowering the total cost of ownership.","We launch the first Mobility Edge device late last year, the Dolphin CT60 for transportation logistics, and direct store delivery. And we will launch two additional Mobility Edge devices for a variety of markets later this year. There has been significant demand for our Android-based products, and we expect to see the impact of our new launches in our second quarter results.","The final highlight is a new environmental commitment we made in China to reduce China-specific greenhouse gas emissions for our facility by 10% per dollar of revenue from 2016 levels by 2022. We've voluntarily implemented more than 100% energy efficiency projects at our sites in China since 2011.","Globally, we have reduced Honeywell's greenhouse gas intensity by more than 65% between 2004 and 2017. Our increased - and increase our energy efficiency by 60% in the same timeframe. By 2019, we reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 10% per dollar of revenue from our 2013 levels. Since 2010, we have implemented more than 3,600 energy efficiency and water conservation projects. We are proud of our environmental, social and governance track record and are committed to continued excellence in this area.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our results in more detail.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks, Darius, good morning. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we had a very strong start to 2018, reported sales up 9%, organic sales up 5% in the quarter. The markets we serve generally are strong, but our continued organic sales growth also reflects our strong market positions and the investments we've made in the sales organization and in new product introductions.","The difference between reported and organic sales is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation mainly related to the euro. Segment profit was up 12% in the quarter and segment margin expanded by 40 basis points to 19.2%, primarily due to the benefits from material productivity, Commercial Excellence, volume leverage on higher sales and benefits from previously funded and completed restructuring projects.","Earnings per share of $1.95, up 14% exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by $0.02. This excludes spin-related separation cost of about $55 million in the quarter. We'll walk through the details of our EPS performance in a second.","Free cash flow in the quarter of $1 billion, was up 30% driven by strong operational performance particularly in HBT, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. As Darius mentioned, we're still in the early stages of our working capital initiatives, but we're encouraged by our progress and by the additional opportunities that are emerging from the enterprise-wide focus we have in this area.","We continue to deploy capital and in the quarter we purchased nearly $950 million worth of Honeywell shares, after growth investments and paying a competitive dividend, our preference is to deploy capital to M&A. But in the absence of immediate opportunities, we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase outstanding shares.","Q1 certainly presented ample buying opportunities given the pricing level and our general positive outlook on the growth of the company. So overall, we are pleased with the start to the year with robust sales growth and high quality earnings.","Slide 5 walks our earnings per share from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. The preponderance of our earnings growth $0.21 came from segment profit improvement, driven by enhanced sales growth across the company, the impacts from our Commercial Excellent effort - Commercial Excellence efforts, productivity improvements realized through HOS Gold and savings from previously funded and completed restructuring projects.","Below the line items were a $0.03 tailwind this quarter, primarily due to higher pension income reflective of strong performance of the assets in our pension plan and lower discount rate. As a reminder, our U.S. pension plan is approximately 110% funded. And we announced in February that we modified the asset allocation in our funds, shifting our plan assets to comprise about 50% fixed income type investments, up from 20% previously. This change will not affect 2018 pension income.","We do expect a reduction to 2019 pension income, but anticipate being able to overcome the impact due to our profit growth prospects. Therefore, this is not expected to be an EPS headwind for 2019.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6% versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2017. Our estimated rate for the full year remains in the 22% to 23% range. And most of the tailwinds coming from the tax reform legislation will be in the second half of 2018.","In February, I spoke about how the recent U.S. tax reform would impact Honeywell. The $3.8 billion provisional charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 is still subject to revision throughout the course of 2018, but there was no adjustment to that amount in the first quarter. We still expect to repatriate approximately $7 billion of overseas cash by the end of 2019 with at least $4 billion of that coming in 2018, as Darius said earlier.","There continues to be a regular flow of guidance and clarification in this area, which could result in changes the provisional charge, the effective rate and the timing of the repatriation. We'll continue to update you on any material changes that arise. To close out the walk, other items including the lower share count from our share repurchase activity and non-controlling interest were $0.02 benefit versus the first quarter of 2017.","Let's turn to Slide 6, as you recall, we change the HBT organization structure to segregate the Homes business from the rest of the portfolio that will remain with Honeywell after the spin-off. Buildings is roughly a $5.3 billion business, so just over half of the HBT portfolio, and includes building products like fire controls, commercial security, and air and water filtration products.","Connected Buildings' includes our controls and integrated software for commercial HVAC and building management. Building solutions' includes our integrated hardware, software, installation and service offerings for more complex buildings and structures.","Homes is roughly a $4.5 billion business that comprises comfort and care, including our residential thermostats and HVAC controls; safety and security, which includes the residential components of our former security business; and distribution which is the global ADI business. You will see the sales from the Homes and Building businesses, separately presented in our filings beginning this quarter.","Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our segment results for the quarter. Beginning with Aerospace sales were up 8% on organic basis, led by commercial OE, where growth in both air transport and business aviation was nearly double-digit driven by robust deliveries on key platforms including the A320, Boeing 737 and Bombardier Challenger 350. We are on winning platforms and continue to expand our installed base. We expect the OE growth and installed base to continue as our long cycle backlog in the OE business is up more than 15%.","As Tim mentioned in our Investor Day in February, we are beginning to see the business aviation OE market recover. Our winning positions across engines, APUs, and avionics will benefit us in the anticipated upturn. In defense, we achieved close to 20% growth in U.S. defense, driven by higher sensors, and guidance systems and engines demand, and sales of engines and avionics spares into Army and Navy programs.","Transportation Systems grew 7% organically driven by demand for light vehicle gas and commercial vehicle turbos, particularly in North America and in China. Organic growth in Commercial Aftermarket of 4% was driven primarily by strong R&O demand and another quarter of double-digit growth for our JetWave satellite communications hardware, partially offset by delayed spare shipments.","For the full year, we expect Aftermarket organic sales growth in the low to mid single-digits range. Aerospace sales were up 12% on a reported basis, with the difference between the organic sales growth resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations, which was a 3-point impact, and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which was a 1-point impact. We anticipate that the revenue recognition impact will be immaterial for the full year.","Aerospace segment profit was up 12% and segment margin expanded 10 basis points. We continue to see the benefits from the Honeywell initiatives to drive productivity and Commercial Excellence, and we incurred slightly lower customer incentives. But this was largely offset by higher volumes of lower-margin OE shipments, inflation and foreign exchange. It's also noteworthy we expanded margins 90 basis points in the first quarter of 2017, generating significant productivity and repositioning benefits on flat organic sales.","We're pleased with the installed base growth in Aerospace, resulting from the pickup in OEM volumes. And expected margin expansion will improve sequentially throughout the year.","In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was 2% for the quarter. Homes grew 6%, driven by double-digit growth in residential thermal solutions and robust demand for thermostats in North America. Sales grew across all regions in ADI, driven by Commercial Excellence, new product introductions, and demand in India and in Europe.","In the Buildings business, organic sales growth was flat year-over-year. The legacy Building Solutions grew 4%, driven by backlog conversion in the energy vertical and strong demand in high growth regions, but was partially offset in buildings products as a result of lower seasonal demand for air and water products in China. And some temporary supply chain challenges within the buildings products business.","HBT segment margins expanded 50 basis points, driven by Commercial Excellence, the benefits from previously funded and completed restructuring and material productivity. In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3% on an organic basis, driven by growth in Process Solutions and in UOP. Sales in HPS were up 4% organically with solid growth globally in thermal solutions and strong demand for gas and electricity meters in EMEA.","Short-cycle demand was also strong in the HPS aftermarket and field instrumentation businesses. UOP sales were up 3%, driven by robust engineering and catalyst growth in both refining and petrochemicals, the latter being driven by new units in China. In Advanced Materials, continued customer adoption of our broad range of Solstice low-global-warming products drove growth. The strong orders growth throughout PMT and the UOP long-cycle backlog growth is fueling our expectations for continued PMT sales growth.","PMT segment margin was flat year-over-year. Benefits from previously funded restructuring, productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence were offset by unfavorable mix, the timing of catalyst shipments at the end of the quarter in UOP and in foreign exchange. In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by double-digit sales growth at Intelligrated for major new systems.","Orders growth at Intelligrated this quarter was extraordinary and contributed to the long-cycle backlog improvement I mentioned earlier. SPS also experienced higher volumes in sensing and scanning products with strong demand in India and China. We were encouraged by the orders momentum, stemming from the launch of our first Mobility Edge Android product offering. We expect to see an improvement in mobility sales in subsequent quarters as the remainder of the Mobility Edge products that Darius mentioned earlier are launched.","Similar to the fourth quarter, the robust volume growth and ongoing productivity efforts in SPS enabled 130 basis points of segment margin expansion. Before we get into our second quarter and full year outlook I wanted to provide some information on how the recently announced tariffs will affect Honeywell, as well as the proactive actions we're taking to address these items.","So I'm on Page 8. Regarding the Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, based on what has been enacted as of today, our exposure is relatively minimum, less than $10 million of gross tariff impact. Our direct tier 1 and indirect tier 2 spend in these categories across Honeywell is small, and the imported portion of that spend is even smaller.","The more significant impact is the secondary effect from the price inflation on non-imported steel and aluminum. Here, we put in place aggressive mitigation strategies that largely offset any impact to Honeywell. Regarding the China tariffs, this is clearly a fluid situation. We continue to assess our exposure while also actively developing mitigation plans. The proposed tariffs do not take effect until May. And the U.S. and China intend to negotiate in the interim.","We suspect this scope of impacted products and tariffs is likely to change. But we'll be prepared either way and update you as we learn more. As Darius mentioned, the impacts of anything that has been enacted as of today, so the Section 232 tariffs, has been considered in our full-year outlook.","I'll cover the expectations for the second quarter on Slide 9. We exited the first quarter with strong order rates and backlogs, which we expect would drive strong organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. In the second quarter, segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 50 basis points, driven by increased volumes, Commercial Excellence and productivity net of inflation, leading to earnings per share of $1.97 to $2.03 or growth of 9% to 13%.","We expect that our second quarter tax rate will approximate 24% and continue to expect that our full-year tax rate will be between 22% and 23%. Consistent with our previous communications guidance for the second quarter and the full-year excludes cost related to Homes and Transportation Systems' spin-offs as well as adjustments, if any, to last year's provisional charge related to the tax reform legislation.","In Aerospace, we expect continued strength in commercial aviation original equipment sales. On the air transport and regional side growth will be driven by demand for the Boeing 737, and A318 and A320. We also expect continued growth in business and general aviation as the oversupply of used aircraft continues to subside, OE new platform certifications are attained and mandates continue to come into effect.","Within the aftermarket, we expect strong repair and overhaul demand, driven by flight hour growth in both ATR and business aviation. We anticipate continued double-digit growth in the defense business with robust spares volume, both in the U.S. and internationally, F-35 demand and growth in sensors and guidance products. Within Transportation Systems, we expect similar dynamics as the first quarter that is strong gas turbo demand in China and the U.S., and continued growth in commercial vehicles.","In Home and Building Technologies, we anticipate continued growth in homes products, driven by strong demand for thermostats and residential thermal solutions, and continued strength in ADI globally as a result of Commercial Excellence and High Growth Region efforts in that business.","On the building side of the business, strong orders exiting the first quarter point to robust demand for building products, particularly commercial fire products. And we expect continued momentum in Building Solutions. In Performance Materials and Technologies the second quarter dynamics are expected to be similar to those of the first quarter.","In UOP, we expect growth across all businesses, including strength in licensing and equipment, catalyst demand driven by new units and reloads in China and gas processing and hydrogen backlog conversion. Exiting the first quarter, our order rates were up double-digit for smart energy and thermal solutions and Process Solutions, which will drive continued demand for those products in the second quarter.","In Advanced Materials, we expect continued customer adoption of our Solstice low-global-warming products for applications like supermarket refrigeration, aerosols and foam insulation in addition to ongoing momentum in Solstice mobile air-conditioning.","Second quarter margin performance in PMT will be driven by similar forces as the first quarter with benefits from productivity, increased volumes and Commercial Excellence, partially offset by the mix of higher equipment and engineering growth, sales of lower margin catalyst and higher installation services revenue within the gas processing business. Our PMT installed base is large and continues to grow. UOP backlog is up more than 15%, putting us in a really great position, which will drive strong future profitable growth as these projects enter into our serviceable installed base.","In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we anticipate continued double-digit growth in Intelligrated building off strong orders and long-cycle backlog from the first quarter. Safety will also be strong, significant demand for gas detection and high-risk safety products. Within the productivity business, we expect continued demand for legacy sensing products building on strong first quarter orders growth in that business. Additionally, our new Android-based product launches are starting to drive growth.","I'll move to Slide 10 to cover our revised full-year guidance. We've updated our full year sales, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter as well as our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of 2018. Our revised guidance incorporates the impacts of enacted new U.S. tariffs for steel and aluminum. As I discussed previously, we expect to fully mitigate the effect of the steel and aluminum tariffs in each business unit.","We are also working through plans to address the impact, if any, from other potential tariffs that have been announced, but not enacted. Full-year organic sales are now expected to be up 3% to 5%. This is driven by favorable conditions in our end markets, our emphasis on organic growth initiatives like Commercial Excellence and continued penetration in High Growth Regions, along with robust long-cycle orders and backlogs.","On a segment level, we now expect Aerospace organic sales to be up 3% to 5% versus a previous range of 1% to 3% driven by an improved commercial OE outlook, particularly in business aviation, and strong demand within our U.S. defense business.","The organic growth rate and margin outlooks for all other segments are unchanged. We have updated the reported figures to reflect the anticipated continued tailwind from foreign currency translation.","Our segment margin estimates for the full year remain unchanged. We raised the low-end of our free cash flow guidance by $100 million and continue to target free cash flow growth of more than 20%, driven by higher net income, lower CapEx and better working capital performance in all of our businesses.","Our estimated full-year effective tax rate continues to be between 22% and 23% and our guidance is planned at the higher end of that range. As Darius mentioned, we also raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.10 on the low-end and $0.05 on the high-end. The new range of $7.85 to $8.05 represents earnings growth of 10% to 13%.","Our guidance reflects a revised weighted average share count of 758 million shares, which is down approximately 2% from 2017 and does not reflect additional share repurchases that might occur over the remaining course of 2018.","Let me wrap up on Slide 11. The first quarter was an outstanding start to 2018, 5% organic sales growth, 14% earnings growth, 30% free cash flow growth, and impactful Connected Product launches across the portfolio. We expect the momentum to continue. We've got strong order rates and a growing backlog as we begin the second quarter. Our second quarter EPS guide of $1.97 to $2.03 reflects that momentum.","We raised our full-year guidance to reflect our performance and the positive macro environment in many of our end markets and continue to be well-positioned for outperformance in 2018. The preparation for our two spinoffs - Homes and Transportation Systems - continues. And we're on track for their timely completion. So with that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are now available to answer your questions. So, Cathy, if you could, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan.","Stephen Tusa","Hi, guys, good morning.","Thomas Szlosek","Good morning.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","Can you just walk through the - kind of as you look at the second half, some of the puts and takes in some of the businesses that will either accelerate or decelerate? I mean, I think this quarter was obviously good organic growth. It was a little bit bifurcated with some doing well and some more in the low single digits. Maybe if you could talk about some of the sub-segments that move around in the back-half of the year?","Darius Adamczyk","Sure, I can start and then turn it over to Tom. I mean, I think, overall, kind of the summary note is we're pretty - we're fairly bullish on all the segments. Obviously, aero started off with the year very, very strong from top line growth rate. We anticipate that mix to change a bit more between OE and aftermarket. So that might temper the growth rate at the top level, but nevertheless, should improve margin performance.","In terms of PMT, we see acceleration clearly in the second half of the year, particularly in HPS and UOP, especially given the kind of order rates that we've seen and also a much more favorable mix going forward.","HBT, a very solid quarter, we expect that one to kind of remain steady for the year. We don't see sort of any major changes versus the kind of run rates we've seen. And in SPS, I think that one, the growth rates there we anticipate to be similar, if not, higher going forward, certainly even more upsides from Intelligrated, further recovery from the productivity products business and safety, so overall, kind of flat to down. So, that's sort of at a higher level. Tom, if you want to just\u2026","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, no, I mean, the only thing I'd add is - and it's a good summary - the strong performance in the first quarter across the board. I think Aerospace in particular was the one that gave us more lift than we anticipated. And that's the reason we're principally raising the guide for sales growth for the rest of the year. The other three businesses, their growth guidance is the same. And then margin guidance for each of the business, relatively similar to what we had guided previously.","Stephen Tusa","And in aero, is - the commercial aero OE drivers, is that\u2013 was that large commercial? Or was that beginning to see some of the bizjet pickup?","Darius Adamczyk","It's both. We got close to double-digit in both of the segments.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And then one last one, Darius, acquisition pipeline, any change in your view there? There was some buzz about perhaps a big catalyst deal. How do you view the catalyst space? It's not obviously a software-related asset. But is it something that, obviously, you guys continue to find attractive? Or is it - would you rather focus your acquisition dollars on more software-specific assets, Connected assets?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I would say the pipeline continues to be robust. I wouldn't believe everything you read, Steve. But I think overall as we look at our UOP business, that's one of our - that's one of the best businesses we have in the portfolio. And anything we can do to complement and augment it, it's probably something that would certainly deserve a look. But, overall, I mean, I think you saw we deployed capital in Q1.","I thought the stock was a steal at 165 bucks a share. In the low $140s it becomes an absolute no-brainer. So we did deploy capital a bit more aggressively in Q1 than we anticipated, given the opportunistic market that presented itself. But I will tell you that we're very aggressively looking at potential M&A. And we expect something to happen here, hopefully, in the next quarter or two.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. Great, thanks a lot.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you, guys. Just to follow up on the last question, I was hoping you could expand upon what types of maybe acquisition sizes you're seeing out there. What would be a reasonable expectation this year in terms of how much capital you may deploy for acquisitions? I know it's hard to tell. But any more color on the pipeline\u2026","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I think there are so many factors involved here that it's to say this kind of size and this kind of size. It all depends what the opportunities are. I think I've stated before and I'll stay consistent, that our preference is for bolt-on acquisitions, so roughly in that $3 billion or less ZIP code purchase price. That's sort of a rough figure. But that's kind of what I'd expect. And based on the pipeline and based on what we see in there. I'm still fairly confident of that figure.","So that's kind of my expectations. I don't anticipate any sort of mega-deals out there. I don't see that happening, so kind of expect something $3 billion or less in that kind of a range.","Gautam Khanna","And one follow-up, Darius, in the past you've talked about how portfolio-review is going to be kind of an iterative process. You obviously have the spins. I'm just curious. I mean, are there other things in the portfolio that, as you learn more about, maybe don't fit? Or I'm just curious how evolutionary is this process. Or do you basically have what you need and it's\u2026","Darius Adamczyk","Oh, no, no, it's definitely haven't - no, it's going to - we look at that a couple of times a year, at least a couple of times a year, if not, more. So we're continuously looking at the deep-dive of our portfolio. Our internal strategic planning period is in July. So, as you can imagine, it's going to be another full review and we do that two, three times a year.","So as I mentioned last year, the portfolio is always going to be evolving. We're always going to be making it better and kind of adding to the top, subtracting from the bottom businesses that we don't classify as Honeywell businesses that may be fantastic businesses in their own right, but frankly, don't fit the Honeywell portfolio.","So I expect that kind of a top-grading process and a bit what is a Honeywell business to continue. By the way, not that there's anything imminent, but you should expect us to continue to review our portfolio.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Thomas Szlosek","Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you, Gautam.","Operator","We will now move to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. My first question really around the segment margin guide, so Q1 was up about 40 bps. I think the top-end of the second quarter margin guide is up 50. And you've got the full-year at the top-end up around 60. So I guess aviation or Aerospace, I can understand, you've got the mix headwind maybe abating as you go through the year in terms of OE versus aftermarket. But I just wondered, if there was anything else you would call out either within Aerospace or other segments, like inflation or currency impacts on margin that you think will reverse.","Thomas Szlosek","No, I don't think there's any major changes from what we've talked about in the original guide. I mean, we are seeing a little bit more inflation, but I think we are able to offset that through our productivity initiatives. And mix-wise, it's - it isn't really much of a different dynamic except, as I said, for Aerospace, we've got a bit heavier on the OE side. And within the defense business we've got a different mix on platforms. But other than that, we're pretty much in line with what we had guided.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And the cadence on productivity savings and so on is fairly smooth through the year?","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, pretty much.","Darius Adamczyk","It is. I think, I would - the other thing I would just point out, Julian, is that this kind of a revenue beat, we still came in right dead-center of our range on margin expansion. That's not that easy to do, right? When you beat revenue, generally, there's - you take some hit in terms of margin expansion. And we did both. We beat revenue and stayed very much bull's eye on exactly what we say we were going to do on margin expansion. So I think that, that's a good set of facts.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around process. I think you called out a good short-cycle demand, areas like instrumentation and aftermarket activity. Just wondered what you're seeing on the large project side within Process Solutions in terms of orders and quoting activity of customers.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, we're actually bullish on the second half, especially as we look at our order pipeline and some of the mega deals that we haven't seen in a while. It's actually the order pipeline looks very robust. And we actually expect then improvement in terms of some of the potential larger deals in the second half of this year. So we remain - we very much remain bullish on the process business with continued growth. And we anticipate securing some of those larger mega deals in the second half of this year.","Julian Mitchell","Great.","Thomas Szlosek","The other thing I'd mention, Julian, is the - when you look at process, you see the impact of the growth in the installed base, because the service bank continues to grow nicely for us. And it's pushing double digits in terms of the backlog of service bank. So we're really encouraged by continued investments in projects that build out that installed base and give us that momentum going forward.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Julian.","Thomas Szlosek","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Darius Adamczyk","Hey, Jeff.","Thomas Szlosek","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple things on my mind. First, just on the cost and on the tariff situation, was there a particular reason you called out UOP as at risk to Chinese retaliation? Why that and not possibly other areas of Honeywell in China?","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, I mean, when you look at the - well, first of all, I mean, aluminum and steel, I mean, we're not a heavy metal company. It's - we're not - I mean, we're technology, so not a lot of steel and aluminum. But when you look at the tariffs that are country-specific, those don't tend to distinguish between commodities.","And in our case, there was a fair amount of activity in UOP around catalyst technology and equipment that flows between the two countries. And that's one we're watching closely. We've got some fairly good contingency plans that we are developing and are in place. So we're not counting on this just evaporating and going away; some involve changes to the supply chain; some involve acceleration; some involve working with our customers on different outcomes. But rest assured that Rajeev and Rebecca, Darius are all very much focused on how to deal with the impacts.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah. And I think the other thing, Jeff, just to point out is that a lot of this stuff has not actually been enacted yet. But nevertheless, we want to make sure we're prepared through a combination of shifting of the supply chains, alternative supply chains, value capture, all those elements. So we want to make sure that we're prepared and also offering comment to a lot of the proposed tariffs. So we're kind of working this one on many, many fronts to make sure that we don't get caught flat-footed.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just a couple other quick ones. Just on cash flow, Tom, I think you said you're driving towards 20%-plus. Obviously, your range is, I think, 7% to 20%. So it sounds like you've got some confidence or visibility in that. What needs to happen to get to the upper end of the cash flow range?","Thomas Szlosek","I think we need to do more of what we did in the first quarter. Actually, what was really nice about the first quarter was that our working capital was about - when you look at our statement of cash flows, you'll see the amounts we put into working capital were identical year-over-year, despite the significant growth that we had on the top line, so we're managing that well. And I think, if we can continue to do that, we'll be in good shape.","The other thing that, of course, is helping us is, we've moderated our CapEx spend. I think our CapEx spend in the quarter was down probably $30 million or so year-over-year. So between those two factors and the good volume, I think we are on that trajectory that you referred to.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just quickly I understand all the mix effects going on in aero. But I was little surprised you said you see aftermarket only growing low to mid singles this year. The RPMs and other data would suggest it should be better than that. Is there anything unusual going on there for you? And I'll pass the floor. Thanks.","Thomas Szlosek","No, Jeff, I don't think so. I mean, for us, there certainly is a fair amount of new installed base getting built out. And you have some of the older models that would drive good service bank and good service business coming out of service actually, so - and while the new installed base is under warranty, you tend to see a little bit lower revenues on the service side. But overall, both on spares and R&O, the demand is pretty healthy. And hopefully, we'll continue to drive an accelerated growth over the 4% that we had in the first quarter.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, one other maybe fact to point out, Jeff, is that we're also driving much more service contracts rather than break-fix events. And then, we just feel that, that's the right way to operate with our customers. So we probably will have a little bit less cyclicality than some of the others, because we want to drive a much more consistent revenue stream rather than kind of a break-and-fix approach.","And I think it's one that we've done in a lot of our other businesses, which really aligns our objectives, which is greater durability, better reliability that goes with the customer rather than the opposite, so that's also a factor here. And Tim and his team are driving a lot of service contracts, both around the Connected Aircraft as well as the service agreements.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Hey, good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Darius or Tom, aero service, you just mentioned, obviously a little slower. But Aerospace organic growth has been accelerating every quarter for over a year now as you know. And business jets and U.S. defense spending both might get further accelerated. So what really holding you back from recording mid to even high single-digit organic growth for the year? Is it just more difficult second half comparisons and maybe still a little conservatism in your forecast?","Darius Adamczyk","Well, I mean, I think obviously we did bump it up this quarter. Overall, we bumped up the guide on the revenue for the year after one quarter. And we're going to see how it goes. Provided we continue to see these kinds of booking rates, these kinds of growth rates, there may be further opportunities in the second half of the year. It's one quarter in.","And although, I'm extraordinarily optimistic both on the Aerospace prospects as well as the broader Honeywell, I also have to notice one quarter. So as we continue to see the business progress, potentially there could be more upside in the second half of the year, but we'll see.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Darius, you mentioned long-cycle backlog of the company was up double digits, which is really good to see. It doesn't seem like you've had any recent erosion in your short-cycle business. But maybe could you address that. Have you seen anything in March and April with the sort of increase in rhetoric around protectionism or has it just been steady as it goes for the company here?","Darius Adamczyk","It's been a bit steady as we go. I mean, March was actually a very, very strong month for us. January was a little bit slower on the short-cycle business. So it's a little bit difficult for me to develop a trend here. And most of the tariff and trade protectionism announcements have been March and April. So impact, if any, is not yet to be felt. April seems to be pretty reasonable based on what we see so far. So we're not seeing major impact yet.","But I also think it's really important, as I pointed out, Jeff, that we're prepared and we take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential enactment of the tariffs, so, so far so good. But we don't know what we don't know. And, clearly, the geopolitical environment today is different than it was three months ago. And, we probably - we don't know more today than three months ago.","Jeffrey Sprague","And as of now, China is quite resilient, right, growth high-single-digits, low-double-digits, something like that.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, no, China growth over in Q1 was north of 20%. So I was actually a little bit more worried about China for this year. But based on Q1, and that's coupled in Q1 with not a particularly great air and water quarter. And even despite all those challenges in that business, we still grew more than 20%. So that gives you an idea of the kind of positions that we enjoy in China and certainly the kind of growth that we continue to experience.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks, Darius.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you. Thank you.","Thomas Szlosek","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now go to Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Hey, good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","You just talked about China. But can we walk around the rest of the world a little bit more on both the current quarter and what your outlook is?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, sure, Scott. So I think, in general, our overall High Growth Regions was high-single-digit, so right about where we were planning. I would tell you, China was a highlight growing north of 20%. India was a little bit slower, I think mid-single-digit. That was a bit of a surprise. But we expect that to recover in the rest of the year. Middle East, we're seeing some uptick in activity, think about mid-single-digit there as well.","In terms of probably some of our challenges, and it continues to be a little bit of a challenge, is Latin America namely Brazil, that we don't see much of a recovery, the election later this year and hopefully continue to see some stability. But I would say that's a challenge. Solid growth both in North America and Europe, so that good level of growth continues there. And overall, fairly steady and consistent growth profile with the exception of Brazil, which continues to be a challenge.","Thomas Szlosek","And just on India, Darius mentioned it was little disappointing. But three of the four businesses were actually double-digits. PMT had some timing on some projects that we'll push out into the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. So I think I would expect that India overall composite growth number to improve sequentially over the course of the rest of the year.","Scott Davis","Okay, helpful. And just back to - there has been two questions now on M&A. And I just - I wanted to just dig into one thing. I mean, when you think about the Analyst Day, there was a lot of - I think, Darius, as you took over big focus on Connected products. And when we hear the rumors out there, potential deals and such, how important is doing - or building a portfolio from here that has that thematically and some component at least of IoT?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I think it's important. But if you really take a look at the criteria of what's Honeywell business and what I look for, nowhere does it say it has to be Connected, it has to have an IoT component. That's actually not one of the criteria. But the only thing I do say is that I like less cyclical rather than more cyclical. But I don't think that, that's a requirement. Obviously, it's something that we would clearly look at.","But if we take a look at businesses that are less susceptible to disruption, where we see good growth vectors, which are well aligned to mega trends, tougher to disrupt, steady growing rather than highly cyclical, they don't necessarily have to be IIoT-related for us to have an interest. So clearly, those have an interest, but so do technology businesses that don't necessarily have an IIoT orientation.","Scott Davis","Okay. Good clarification. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Thomas Szlosek","Thanks, Scott.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we now have our question from Peter Arment of Baird.","Peter Arment","Thanks. Good morning, Darius and Tom.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Arment","Tom, hey, a quick one on just bizjet activity, because it's been a while before we've seen this kind of, I guess, more upbeat around the bizjets. And I know you've got some new launches this year. So I would expect the OE to be up. But what are you seeing on just the kind of the aftermarket side. And is this really, I think, a new upturn that we're finally seeing?","Thomas Szlosek","Well, on the OE - you mean on the OE side, Peter? Or the\u2026","Peter Arment","Yeah, on the OE. But I mean, also just what you're seeing also on the aftermarket.","Thomas Szlosek","No, I think the - I mean, you can read all the stuff that we read about the used jet inventory and the prices and so forth. That clearly is a favorable factor for us. But, I think the biggest thing is the new launches that are coming out. And we've talked a lot about in the last couple of years about our winning positions on the various platforms. And whether it's Cessna, Gulfstream and so forth, they've got all - they've got certifications coming out in 2018. And that's going to be a nice factor for us.","The other thing is the mandates. You continue to see some of these mandates coming into effect up and through 2020, 2021. I mean, that's going to drive our growth as well. So as I said, we - for the first quarter, we approached double-digit growth in the OE on both ATR and BGA. And knock on wood, we're encouraged by the momentum.","Peter Arment","Okay. And just a clarification, on your air transport aftermarket number, you're up 4% in the quarter. But is this - I mean, you had some very strong numbers last year. Is this more, I think, a normalization or tougher comps when we think about 2018?","Thomas Szlosek","I think, it's kind of what I was saying earlier. I mean, overall the level of activity has been robust. You are seeing a different mix in the installed base of newer aircraft that are under warranty, have less maintenance. You see older aircraft coming out. But beyond that, the level of both repair and overhaul activity on spares has been solid.","Peter Arment","Okay, great. Thanks.","Thomas Szlosek","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will now move next to Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Szlosek","Good morning, Joe.","Darius Adamczyk","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie","Tom, if I heard you correctly, you mentioned the impact from tax reform is likely to be felt a little bit more in the second half of the year. And so, like, look the organic growth rate has been great in the last few quarters. Maybe talk a little bit about how customer conversations are evolving in the parts of your portfolio that you would expect to benefit the most if you do start to see an increase in CapEx investing as the year progresses.","Thomas Szlosek","Yeah, I mean, I would point to our long-cycle businesses, I think. I mean, we just got done talking about business jet. That could be a factor that's contributing to the - that OE momentum that I referenced. I think on the oil and gas side, I mean, I think, it's more to do with stability on the pricing and the confidence that it's giving the industry, where you're going to see more CapEx will return to - not return to previous peak levels, but certainly an improvement from the declines we've seen in the last couple of years. Those are the - I think, two places that I would say we see it the most.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. And then maybe following on, on Peter's question for just a second. I didn't hear you guys mention anything on the commercial helo market. I'd be curious to hear any commentary there, just given this uptick we've seen in oil and gas recently.","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I think, commercial helo is probably not a highlight yet. We don't see sort of major robust level of activity there yet. But I think we're more than enthused based on what we're seeing on the - our air transport and now uptick in activity in business jets.","So I guess, there always has to be one little bit of a lowlight. And I would say there's not as strong a recovery as we would have hoped on commercial helo. But nevertheless, the rest of the Aerospace business is very strong, so.","Thomas Szlosek","And it's not that it's negative. I mean, internationally as an example, we are seeing very modest growth on the helo side. But it's not what we were experiencing a year ago or two years ago in terms of the pressures.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. And then, maybe if I can stick in one last one. On PMT, the margin trajectory, so it sounds like the first half of the year you're kind of calling for kind of flattish-type margins in PMT. As we progress through the year, mix gets a little bit better. Is that - you already have a lot of that mix in your backlog today? Or do you need to see something out of order in order to see kind of like the margin improvement in the second half?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I mean, Joe, as you know, PMT is a tough business to judge based on one quarter, because as you know the catalyst makeup and what we ship, and the mix particularly when UOP can dramatically change the results. So both based on the backlogs that we see, based on the short-cycle activity and HPS and so on. When we get to the end of the year, we're very comfortable that the margin expansion is going to look very much in line with what we're projecting and continue to be very, very bullish on the PMT business.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks, Joe.","Thomas Szlosek","Okay, Joe.","Operator","And we have time for one last question. And that will come from Steven Winoker of UBS.","Steven Winoker","Hey, thanks for fitting me in guys. I appreciate it.","Darius Adamczyk","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, Darius. I can't help but go back to one of your first comments, which was the fact that the stock is a no-brainer in the $140. You did spend $950 million on the share-repo this quarter. That's a good number. But if you're only looking for these acquisitions in the $3 billion or less range, you got cash continuing to come in, why not step in even more aggressively? Or how are you kind of thinking about that? Is it just to keep the powder dry and be more methodical? Or are you really try to be more opportunistic, in which case it might be larger?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, well, I think obviously this is - what we bought back in Q1 is higher than what we normally do. If you look back about our buyback trends, this level of buyback in Q1 is actually relatively aggressive, because I just - like I said, I thought it was a steal at $165. In the $140s, it just - it was - it's absolutely compelling.","Now, having said that, you're right, I mean, I do want to keep the powder dry. We indicated both at our Investor Day and our Q1 - or our Q4 call that we have a slight preference for M&A. So as we kind of see the year evolve, we'll see how things change. As I mentioned prior - in the call, we do have a fairly robust M&A pipeline.","I do hope that one or two deals materialize here in the next quarter or two. And we'll see how it goes. So it's - I know kind of deploying everything all at once and without having further optionality I don't think is ever a great idea. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. But I think the value of the stock currently is compelling at the same time. So it's the constant tradeoff that we go through.","Steven Winoker","And one other one on aero, which is there's a lot still being discussed about the large air framers partnering for success, et cetera, and kind of continuing to apply pressure in thinking about how to change the business models in the industry. Are you seeing any other kind of early developments on that front? Are you - what gives you confidence, conviction, that your business model will be able to sustain itself, in light of that attempted vertical integration?","Darius Adamczyk","Yeah, I mean - I think both - well, couple of things. Number one is our relationship with Boeing remain strong and we expect that to continue. Number two, I think as you look at our services that I referred to earlier as you think about the value story around the Connected Aircraft, that's compelling to our end-customers. And that's reflected into service rates, the order rates that we're seeing, the interest.","I talked about the deal with Singapore and you think about Singapore is clearly one of the market leaders in terms of their thinking and their approach to aviation. So I remain very, very bullish on our approach. And given the kind of set of offerings that we have in the Aerospace segment, both in mechanical and avionics, we are uniquely positioned to be a key player in the Connected Aircraft. And that's being reflected in the kind of relationships we're able to formulate and the business we're enjoying. And I think it's only going to accelerate.","Thomas Szlosek","I think the technology\u2026","Steven Winoker","Okay, great.","Thomas Szlosek","I was going to say, the technologies that we have invested in the - number of engineers that we have supporting all of the different product platforms and the verticals that we serve, puts us in a very unique position in terms of developing offerings that get us on platforms, as you've seen over the last few years, for us to continue to win more than our fair share. So it's those investments and keeping those fresh and alive are what is going to enable us to compete robustly.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. Talk to you soon. Thanks a lot. Bye.","Darius Adamczyk","Thank you.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","We delivered exceptional results in the first quarter of 2018 and have strong order rates and a growing backlog as we begin the second quarter. I am confident in our ability to deliver outstanding results for our customers, our share owners and our employees. One last note, in a few weeks, we will be hosting an Investor Showcase to highlight our Safety and Productivity Solutions business, particularly our technologies for the Connected Warehouse and Connected Supply Chain.","John Waldron and his team are looking forward to showing you why we're so excited about the growth opportunities in that business.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mark Macaluso","Thank you Sean, good morning and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote, President and Chief Operating Officer, Darius Adamczyk, and Senior Vice President and CFO Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.Honeywell.com\/investor.","As a reminder, elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light.","We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 and share our guidance for the first quarter of 2017. As always, we will leave ample time for your questions at the end.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.","Dave Cote","Good morning, everyone. While we finished 2016 with a strong fourth quarter delivering earnings per share of $1.74 and that\u2019s up 14% year-over-year. The quality of earnings was strong driven by double digit growth in our European sources portfolios within Performance, Materials and Technologies as well as continued strength in Transportation systems and the Home and Building Technologies distribution business.","We also funded more than $30 million in new restructuring projects and absorbed more than $115 million in Aerospace OEM incentives. We finished the year by exceeding the segment margin and free cash flow estimates that we provided during December.","Segment margins for the fourth quarter expanded by 90 basis points excluding M&A, mostly due to productivity and benefits from the significant restructuring actions we executed throughout the year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion with 126% conversion driven by improved working capital. For the full year earnings of $660 increased 8% year-over-year operationally, our segment margins improved by 80 basis points for the year.","In 2016, we also completed several significant portfolio actions that will deliver attractive future returns for our shareowners. The spinoff of our resins and chemicals business not only reduces the cyclicality and improved the margin profile of our performance materials and technologies business but it also created nearly 800 million in showing the value. And at today's AdvanSix stock price that value is $1.1trillion.","We\u2019ve sold our aerospace government services business and reinvested $175 million of the proceeds into earnings enhancing restructuring projects. We split the former automation and control solutions business into two new more nimble reporting segments that will deliver better growth, speed and productivity.","In 2016, we also funded more than $250 million in restructuring projects that will provide a significant tailwind this year and beyond. We also deployed more than $2 billion for share purchases funded a high return capital projects through $1.1 billion of CapEx and refinanced our debt reducing are expected 2017 interest expense by about 8% while increasing our aggregate borrowings by $4 billion.","Lastly, we successfully implemented a comprehensive CEO and segment leadership succession plan. Darius has hit the ground running and has worked extensively with our businesses on their 2017 operations and strategic plans.","As Darius and Tom share during our outlook call in December, we remain optimistic about 2017 and we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance of 6% to 10% earnings growth as divestitures and organic sales growth of 1% to 3%.","For the first quarter we are initiating EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.64 which is a 6% to 9% increase year-over-year as divestitures. I\u2019d like to share some of our recent highlights on this next slide which includes some great trends and progress in our connected initiatives.","Our long cycle backlog is improving in a number of our businesses including a double digit improvement in building solutions driven by projects growth, a mid single digit increase in defense and space driven by U.S. defense and a mid single digit improvement in UOP driven by increased equipment demand.","We are seeing continued strength in Intelligrated with backlog of more than 40% and in transportation systems where our win rate for 2016 was more than 50%. Also the pipeline of orders for Solstice remains above $3 billion.","Significant wins in the fourth quarter include a live utility energy service contract to modernize the Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. The upgrade in water and HVAC systems, energy efficient lighting and other advances will significantly reduce their carbon footprint while saving the Air Force more than $3.5 million a year.","UOP got two additional licensing agreements in China. We licensed our Unicracking technology for the production of diesel and naphtha to meet growing Chinese demand for transportation fuels. And we licensed our Methanol-To-Olefins technology which enables the conversion of domestic coal resources to Ethylene and Propylene the essential ingredients for making plastics.","This is UOPs ninth MTO license in China. UOP continues to win in China because of our local expertise, local manufacturing capabilities and our 80-year history of helping the Chinese Petroleum industry [song] tougher challenges.","Also, in UOP we announced that our modular exceeds bioreactor technology; it\u2019s helping a fresh cut, fruit and vegetables company in the U.S. to treat waste water. The unit treats roughly 150,000 gallons a day to meet local standards. Waste water regulations are getting increasingly strict and we have unique technology to help our customers meet these requirements more efficiently and cost effectively with simple, modular equipment for fast installation and low maintenance.","This is our first XCeed facility for the food and beverage industry and growth in segments outside of oil and gas will help reduce the cyclicality of UOP in the future. In Home and Building technologies we finalized a $250 million advanced meter project with Entergy to help improve electricity service and reliability for utility customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.","And our HBT business continues to make advances in high-growth regions providing connected security solutions like a new municipal surveillance system and our new line of INNCOM elements, Guestroom Controls for our hospitality customers.","We are also making significant progress on our connected initiatives, which are powered by the Honeywell Sentience platform. Within connected aircrafts our equipment is available for use on all Airbus platforms and system integrations are in process on the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and 777X.","In the business jet market, Bombardier and Gulfstream will be offering JetWave on selected models of new aircraft and we are certifying the system for aftermarket upgrades on over 30 models. We are nearing a milestone of 500 JetWave deliveries and we continue to receive significant orders. It will be a big part of our growth story in 2017 and beyond.","We have JetWave on our planes and it is awesome. While I was live streaming a TV show on my iPad, I got a phone call on my iPad, answered it had no [Indiscernible] latency, completed the call and returned to the show. It is awesome, really simply awesome.","For Connected homes, we made some exciting announcements at this consumer\u2019s electronic show. We introduced new Lyric do-it-yourself Security cameras which led home owners monitor motion and sound while away from their homes.","We also announced compatibility of the Lyric Home security and control system with Apple HomeKit giving home owners control of their security system through Siri or the Apple Home app.","The ever expanding suite of Lyric connected products now includes cameras, a Water Leak and Freeze Detector, Thermostat and security products to keep homes safe and comfortable. Within connected plant, we announced new INspire partnerships in Honeywell process solutions with Dover Automation and Aereon. It will help manufacturers leverage the industrial Internet of Things to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of operations across a single plant or several plants across an enterprise.","We currently have four partners as part of the INspire program which fosters collaboration between customers, equipment vendors, process licensors, consultants and Honeywell experts. And we expect that number to grow considerably throughout the year.","We also continue to gain traction for our family of cloud based services for the oil and gas industry that anticipates operational complications offering real time solutions to overcome them.","In the last few months we\u2019ve announced agreements to help PetroVietnam produce more gasoline and consumers energy and to help Delek Refining avoid downtime and improve its operations.","Lastly, a few weeks ago we announced the collaboration with Intel to develop IoT Solutions for the retail industry. Honeywell and Intel will jointly develop solutions that utilized the two company\u2019s technology offerings including our sensors, handheld computers, processes, bar code scanners, RFID tag readers and cloud based software. These solutions will help retailers and supply chain firms gain greater visibility into in store inventory, enhance customer service and ensure items ordered online are available for in-store pickup.","A number of these technologies will be on display at our annual investor conference which will take place on March 1, at the Plaza in New York City. Darius and I look forward to talking with you more about our progress then.","So with that, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks, Dave. I\u2019m on slide four. Earnings per share of $1.74 for the quarter increased 14% from 2015 as Dave indicated and now this excludes the charges for debt refinancing and pension mark-to-market we talked about in our guidance and also from 2015 it excludes the divestitures that we did in 2016.","To reemphasize Dave\u2019s point, the double digit increase was achieved even while absorbing the impact of $48 million in incremental year-over-year OEM incentives. The fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $1.34, the lower amount reflects that $0.12 for that debt refinancing as well as the pension mark-to-market of approximately $0.28 a share driven by lower discount rates in U.K. Germany and the U.S.","The 2015 pension mark-to-market charge was about $0.05 a share. Segment profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion and we expanded segment margin by 20 basis points and 19%. Now that\u2019s 90 basis points at 19.7% excluding the first year dilutive impacts from M&A.","Productivity and restructuring benefits along with higher catalyst and Solstice volumes were the key drivers of our margin expansion partially offset by the higher aerospace OEM incentives I just mentioned.","Sales of $10 billion were flat on a reported basis and declined by 1% on a core organic basis. In PMT we delivered double digit core organic sales growth in UOP and in Solstice. In addition, our transportation systems and home and buildings distribution businesses continue to grow nicely. However, we did see declines in Defense & Space and business in general aviation similar to what others are seeing and we had unanticipated supply chain delays within our safety and productivity solutions business at the end of December which modestly diluted our performance in SPS.","Free cash flow in the quarter $1.7 billion, up 8% with conversion of 126% largely driven by improvement in working capital. Our CapEx reinvestment ratio for the quarter exceeded 190% as we continued to invest in high ROI projects. This is the third consecutive year of reinvesting in over 150% of depreciation, but we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize to around one times depreciation as we complete this investment cycle.","CapEx is expected to decrease by about 5% in 2017. Overall, the fourth quarter was a very nice finish to the year.","And now on slide five to discuss the segment performance. Starting with Aerospace, our core organic sales came in at the high end of our December outlook with softness in business and general aviation and prior year program completions at international Defense & Space leading to an overall 5% decline.","Turbo continue to be a great story driven by our penetration in light vehicle gas application. For the year, core organic sales in our gas business were up more than 20% and over 30% in the fourth quarter and we booked more than 5 billion in new platform win bringing our 2016 win rate for all of TC north of 50% as Dave indicated.","Our Aerospace segment margin came in above our forecast driven by stronger productivity and slightly lower OEM incentives that we anticipated, but still higher year-over-year.","Home and building technology delivered 2% core organic growth led by building solutions, global distribution and our high growth regions where we grew more than 10% both China and in India. Growth in our smart energy business improved driven by smart meter programs roll outs in Europe.","HBT margins excluding the first year diluted impact of M&A expanded by 60 basis points driven by benefits from previously funded restructuring and commercial excellence and that was partially offset by the impact of higher distribution sales in the mix.","In PMT core organic sales grew by 5%. UOP was very strong growing 10% in the fourth quarter driven by catalysts, licensing and equipment. Process solutions finished the year with strong sales on software migration services. Now the positive sentiment in our oil and gas businesses continues, and we signs of improving activity with our customers around the world, including a 5% increase in the UOP backlog driven by equipment, engineering and services.","In the fourth quarter, growth in HPS of 8% driven primarily by global megaprojects and the industrial thermal business. Finally Solstice, low global warming refrigerant volume in fluorine products drove 8% core organic sales growth in advanced materials and we expect this trend to continue in 2017.","PMT margin expanded by more than 500 basis points driven by those strong volumes as well as productivity and higher catalyst and licensing volumes in the mix. In SPS, we ended the quarter slightly below our expectations as I mentioned earlier.","Intelligrated continues to perform quite well, its order rates have been strong increasing by double digits in calendar year 2016 and the business is exceeding its income targets despite the acquisition and integration cost we\u2019ve incurred.","SPS segment margin expanded a 100 basis points excluding in the first year dilutive impact of M&A. This was driven by benefits from restructuring and commercial excellence. ","Slide six shows the elements that contributed to our EPS growth in the quarter. This was a quarter of strong earnings growth driven principally by the performance in our business segments.","Starting on the left, earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.53 if you exclude last year\u2019s pension mark-to-market charge and the fourth quarter 2000 earnings associated with the 2016 divestitures.","Operational segment profit reflects our core business performance. So it would exclude non operational impacts such as one time M&A cost, the dilutive impacts from the strength in U.S. dollar and incremental OEM incentives.","Operational segment profit was the big driver contributing $0.19 to earnings. Our continued productivity across the portfolio, the increased volumes most notably from UOP and Solstice, the operating earnings from the nine acquisitions we\u2019ve completed since 2015 and the benefits from restructuring we continue to fund are all fuelling the operational improvements.","All Other is a $0.02 win and includes benefits from below the line items, a slightly lower share count and a lower tax rate, partially offset by the non-operational components of segment profit I mentioned.","This works to earnings of $1.74 per share 14% increase our strongest quarter of 2016.","Let\u2019s turn to slide seven to quickly recap our full year performance. Our full year sales increased 2% on a reported basis. For the year we had a good growth in home and building distribution, lower gas platforms within transportation systems, the commercial aviation aftermarket in aerospace and in our Solstice business in performance, materials and technologies.","You can see a summary of our segment performance on the right of this slide and more details about our segments fourth quarter and full year sales performance are in the appendix. Segment margins expanded by 10 basis points, excluding the dilutive first year impact of the M&A driven by productivity and restructuring benefits partially offset by higher aerospace OEM incentives and the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange.","Now the incremental year-over-year Aerospace OEM incentives diluted our segment margin by 50 basis points in 2016. As you recall this turns into a slight tailwind in 2017. The result of all this were earnings of $6.60 up 8% year-over-year, free cash flow of $4.4 billion was slightly better than we previewed in December, driven by better working capital performance.","So with 2016 now behind us, let\u2019s take a quick look at some market trends we are seeing as we head into 2017. I\u2019m on slide eight. In our oil and gas businesses the positive trends we started to see at the end of the third quarter continued to evolve. UOP orders grew up more than 30% from the first half to the second half and all of our UOP businesses contributed to a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 in 2016.","UOP project activity is improving and a number of projects that were on hold particularly in China are re-starting. We see good momentum in our high growth regions driven by the demand for refined product in China and India\u2019s accelerated transition to the Euro VI emission standards.","Domestically our modular gas processing orders picked up in 2016 and we expect that to continue in 2017. The activity in our international gas processing business continues to be slow although the pipeline is encouraging. We see similar encouraging trends in process solutions. While the pipeline of new megaprojects continue to be lumpy there have recently been expansions of previous award and start ups of awards that were on hold from prior years.","The activity in our short cycle and software businesses though in advanced solutions lifecycle solutions in service businesses should continue to improve as our customers resume spend in small and midsized projects and on a regional basis, activity in the U.S. China and Russia remains positive.","We are also starting to see signs of improvement in our defense and space portfolio including 7% growth in our backlog and increased activity in our U.S. core defense business. However there is continued softness albeit moderating in our commercial helicopters and domestic space businesses consistent with what others are experiencing. Our plan continues to assume that the [U.S. DoD] continuing a resolution is in place through April.","For the year we expect Defense and Space to be roughly flat on a core organic basis versus 2016. Regarding construction, while commentators have been expecting a slowdown in growth rates in 2017, recent indicators had been more positive. The U.S. Dodge Momentum Index has risen for three consecutive months, reaching a new high in December with a surge in commercial planning intentions, nevertheless we continue to plan conservatively in this space and continue to forecast low single digit growth in residential and commercial construction leading to low to mid single digit growth in HBT","In Aerospace, we expect the weakness in the business jet market will persist over 2017. This is most prominent on the OEM side and our outlook here has not changed. In the aftermarket the number of engine maintenance events is down, this will drive variation in growth quarter to quarter but for the full year we expect aftermarket revenue to be in line with flight hours as our accelerated growth in connectivity solutions and repairs, modifications and upgrades provides offsetting momentum.","Regarding currency as you know most of our exposure in the Euro is hedged at $1.15 and we have selectively hedged other currencies as well. Thanks to this hedging approach there is no change to our EPS outlook despite the stronger U.S. dollar compared to the assumptions we had in our outlook call.","Currency headwinds however will bring down our full year reported sales outlook by about 1.5% and our revised guidance is now 38.6 to 39.5 billion in 2017. The reduction is solely due to the foreign exchange that is mentioned.","So on an overall basis, the markets we serve are largely unchanged from what we said in December, and we will continue to monitor this as we move through the first quarter.","And we move to slide nine with a preview of Q1. For total Honeywell we are expecting first quarter earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.64 that\u2019s up 6% to 9% year-over-year excluding from 2016 the hearings associated with our 2016 divestitures which were about $0.05 in the first quarter.","Sales are expected to be between $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion which is flat up 2% on an organic basis or down 2% to 4% reported. The difference between the reporting core organic sales are due to the divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the impact of acquisitions primarily Intelligrated.","Segment margins are expected to expand by 50 basis points to 80 basis points. We expected the sales in the second half of 2017 will be stronger than the first half. PMT and HBT will have a steady quarterly progression as they have in recent years. The difference is between first and second half are more pronounced in aerospace and safety and productivity solutions, but we have good visibility to the acceleration.","For example in Aerospace in the first half of the year we expect higher year-over-year OEM incentives which as you know impacted top line, but we expect that trend to reverse in the second half. The decrease will drive the 1% incremental road for aerospace in the second half of the year.","In addition we anticipate aerospace aftermarket will be stronger in the second half due to increased sales, repairs, modifications and upgrades including further growth of connected aircraft offerings.","In transportation systems we also have second half growth acceleration. This was driven by scheduled new launches and the lapping of a large program completion that will negatively impact sales in the first three quarters of 2017.","In safety and productivity solutions our second half is expected to be stronger as Intelligrated reaches the one year point in our portfolio in September and its growth is then included as organic. In the safety business we expect positive impacts of a stronger oil and gas industry and are already beginning to see small signs of improvement including increased bookings in gas detection and personal protection equipment and increasing activity from distribution partners in the Gulf.","Lastly, we have significant new product launching in the productivity business in the spring including mobile printers and computers.","For the full year our guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately 25% which is slightly higher than the full year 2016. The tax rate is based on a assumed level of employee stock option exercises and any change in that exercise rate could impact the tax rate. We\u2019ll update you on that as we progress through the quarter.","Our first quarter guide assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 772 million shares. In aerospace, first-quarter sales are expected to be down on a reported basis, primarily due to the divestiture of the aerospace government services business. The strong deliveries to our air transport OE customers for newer platforms are expected to continue driven by the 737, A320 and A355 will be offset by declines in legacy platforms as we previewed in December.","Additionally, sales in business and general aviation will be down and aftermarket sales are expected to be slightly up. Defense and Space will also be slightly up driven by growth in our U.S. core defense business partially offset by declines in international defense, U.S. space and commercial helos.","Finally in Turbo, the strong growth we experienced in 2016 will continue building on continued platform wins, in gas and diesel. Light vehicle gas will continue to be the main driver while we expect a slight improvement in commercial vehicles following a strong fourth quarter there.","Aerospace margins are expected to expand by 40 basis points to 70 basis points driven primarily by productivity, repositioning benefits and the impacts of our foreign exchange hedging strategy partially offset by the unfavorable mix of new versus legacy platform deliveries. HBT sales are expected to be up 1% to 3% driven by new product introduction including the Lyric launches that Dave highlight as well as Elster smart meter programs and another quarter of double digit growth in China primarily driven by our air and water business.","Our high growth region strategy and one China organization continue to serve us very well in this regard. In distribution we expect to see continued conversion of backlog in the energy business of building solutions and strengthen global distribution, which continue to outgrow its markets and peers.","We anticipate that HBT margins will expand by 130 to 160 basis points driven by improving volumes in the products business, commercial excellence and the benefits from our 2016 restructuring action.","In PMT sales are expected to up 3% to 5% on an organic basis or down 10% to 12% on reported basis due to the spinoff for the resins and chemical business. We expect strong orders and sales growth throughout the PMT portfolio as I mentioned earlier. The segment margin expansion will be driven by productivity and the impact of the spinoff. PMT continue to execute very well on their productivity initiatives.","In safety and productivity solutions, we expect that organic sales will be down 1% to up 1%, or up 19% to 21% on a reported basis including Intelligrated acquisition. The safety business is expected to be up slightly in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions in both the industrial safety and retail footwear businesses, improving orders in the industrial vertical overall and improvement in our supply chain.","Productivity business is expected to be flat, slightly down driven by continued retail market softness that is impacting demand for scanners and mobile computers. That being said, we are seeing significant orders growth in our supply chain related business particularly in our voice-enabled connected workers solutions and we expect to clear the supply chain challenges we face in the four quarter.","In addition double-digit growth in Intelligrated is expected to continue. We are confident that our investments in connected retail solutions coupled within Intelligrated warehouse automation solutions are positioning the business for long term growth.","SPS segment margins are expected to be up more than 150 basis points excluding the first year dilutive impact of M&A driven primarily by the impacted productivity and restructuring benefit.","Let me move to slide 10 where we reaffirming our 2017 earnings and organic sales guidance and have updated the year-over-year figures to reflect the 2016 actual results. From a total Honeywell perspective we expect sales in the range of $38.6 to $39.5 billion, up 1% to 3% on a core organic basis.","Reported sale growth will be low in the range of flat to down 2% primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and the divestitures we completed in 2016. As I indicated earlier the difference in 2017 sales of our outlook call is solely related to our FX assumptions.","Segment margins are expected to be 19% to 19.4% or up 70 to 110 basis points versus 2016. Earnings per share expected to be between 685 and 710 or 6% to 10% growth versus [2015].","The quarterly linearity for EPS remains roughly in line with prior years. Free cash flow forecast remains in the range of 4.6 to 4.7, that\u2019s up 5% to 7% from 2016. On the right side of the page we\u2019ve update our segment guidance to reflect the impact of final 2016 results on the variances and updated foreign currency impacts in each business on the sales line, otherwise there are no changes to the outlook from December.","As I said earlier, our tax rate maybe more volatile quarter to quarter depending on the number of employee stock options that are exercise. Our guidance assumes in approximate 25% tax rate at present slightly higher than last year.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 11. To sum up we finished 2016 strongly, 14% earnings growth, 8% free cash flow growth in the fourth quarter and 8% earnings growth for the full year. We reaffirmed our 2017 outlook and expect first quarter EPS to be up 6% to 9% excluding divestitures.","We put together a credible 2017 plan under Darius\u2019s leadership that continue to deliver significant value for our shareowners, our customers and our employees.","With that, Mark, let\u2019s turn it over to Q&A","Mark Macaluso","Dave, Darius and Tom are here to answer your question. So, Shavonne, if you could, let\u2019s open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Dave Cote","Hey, Scott.","Scott Davis","Dave, this is your last conference call?","Dave Cote","It is. This is the last one, and I can promise you I\u2019m really going to miss it.","Scott Davis","Okay.","Dave Cote","That wasn\u2019t a joke. I was serious.","Scott Davis","It\u2019s good for everybody, right. You will be missed, but I\u2019m sure Darius will do a great job.","Dave Cote","I am confident.","Scott Davis","Anyway, well, we know where you live, if he doesn't do a good job, let's put it that way.","Dave Cote","What you do now?","Scott Davis","But guys I have a nit-picky question, this JetWave thing, is this -- it sounds interesting for sure, and you've talked about it for the last couple of years, it's not brand new, but is this more of a just new platforms or can you do a rip and replace and get rid of some of the existing slow WiFi that out there with GoGo?","Dave Cote","You can absolutely retrofit, And that\u2019s one of the comments that I had made, because we\u2019re in that process and I think as consumers start to see what\u2019s possible when you\u2019re using this JetWave service, they\u2019re going to be demanding it. I mean, it really is seller. I was on the plane, I wanted to test this stuff myself, my guy \u2013 given all the guys a hard time by going faster. So I started live streaming the show. It worked perfectly. I got a phone call through the iPad while I was watching the show, answered the phone, almost, in fact I noticed no latency in the call at all. And then when I ended the call, the show resumed exactly where I left off. It was quite impressive.","Darius Adamczyk","I\u2019d add, Scott that we have over 1000 aircraft that are committed to JetWave. We got over 20 airlines wins to-date. It\u2019s a selectable on the airbus we\u2019ve been certified on the platforms that we mentioned earlier. We are working with Boeing to get certified as we said. So it looks pretty good. The growth is very strong double digits for us in 2017.","Scott Davis","So what\u2019s \u2013 how does the profitability on this stuff work, I mean, I assume this is some sort of monthly charge, but when do you start making money on something like JetWave, is it a couple of years of investment then it really starts to kick in or on day one are you shipping out units that are profitable?","Dave Cote","Yes. We make money now.","Scott Davis","Is that a monthly charge, Dave, or is it \u2013 how does it work?","Dave Cote","It\u2019s going to vary on some of that depending on the segment, so I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve shared all that on the business model, but it will vary between large planes and biz jets.","Darius Adamczyk","But to be clear Scott, I mean, there is a significant amount of equipments that goes along with it, which is sell and install model for us, so that is also helping the growth and creates that profitability for us immediately.","Dave Cote","This is a good one.","Scott Davis","Okay, good. That\u2019s all I asked. Good luck guys. Thanks.","Dave Cote","Scott?","Scott Davis","Yes.","Dave Cote","Before you go I will always remember that you were our first supporter back in those dark days when I first started here, so that\u2019s not something I\u2019ll forget and I\u2019ve been obviously pleased that we could prove you correct for the 15 years, but thank you for that.","Scott Davis","You\u2019re quite welcome. I was pretty \u2013I got lucky, that\u2019s all. But not the one, [ex guys].","Dave Cote","It was a bold move at this time and I appreciate it.","Scott Davis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hi. Good morning.","Dave Cote","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa","First of all, congrats to Scott for getting the call right early, it was a good one, and so, congratulations to him. First question what TV show were you watching?","Dave Cote","It was the American. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve see it. I\u2019m only in the first season, so don\u2019t tell me anything.","Steve Tusa","Glad to see you\u2019re still working out hard out there.","Dave Cote","I got to test the system. You don\u2019t want me fly in the plane?","Steve Tusa","I can picture Darius in the same jet just doing something different on his iPad. So just a question on tax, can you maybe just talk about what the dynamics are around, how if repatriation come through border adjustments, just give us some color on your kind of net export position, if the Brady bill does goes through I'm sure you guys have done some analysis, what should we expect?","Dave Cote","We\u2019re a net exporter, so on balance it would benefit us from a tax standpoint. When it comes to repatriation, it depends on what the final deal is. If there is really high tax that\u2019s put on in, well, that makes it a lot less interesting. So, we\u2019ll have to judge it when we see it.","Steve Tusa","And again how much \u2013 if it was a very low rate on repatriation, I mean would you be able to do something pretty quickly?","Dave Cote","Sure.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Darius Adamczyk","There\u2019s going to be some latency between when some things enacted and there is some work that we have to do on earnings and profits, but it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s\u2026","Tom Szlosek","It won\u2019t take years.","Darius Adamczyk","No, not at all.","Steve Tusa","Right. Okay. And then just kind of an annual run rate on Intelligrated, just kind of back of the envelope I\u2019m getting something for this year kind of close to, you\u2019ve given us the eight months contribution, getting something close to that a 1 billion, is that around the right number and what was the annual revenue that its finished out in 2016 for Intelligrated?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. It\u2019s a little bit less than that, I mean around 900 what we\u2019ve called the annual run rate, but it is growing at that 20% flip, so you can see that you could get pretty quickly the numbers you mentioned, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So, the 900 is kind of where it\u2019s growing today in first 2016?","Dave Cote","That\u2019s an annual rate.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And the margin there was relatively low this quarter, I think it was kind of low single digits. How do you kind of see that margin, I know it\u2019s not going to be one of your best margin businesses here in the near term, but what\u2019s kind of the trajectory of getting that to at least to double-digit range, I know it\u2019s a growth story. I\u2019m just curious to when the contribution really kicks up?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. As you can appreciate the first year is always a tough one for M&A particularly one of that size. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve reference those lower margin rates. But when those first year charges goes away as well as when the synergies kick in, we\u2019ll be low double digit kind of a margin rate. The interesting thing though is that the installed base that we\u2019ve build really gives us a platform for other offering particularly on the software side, and that's one of the main reason we bought the business is to be in the supply chain and distribution arena from a technology perspective, that\u2019s going to help that margin rate as well.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. And then one last quick one, Dave and Darius at the March Investor Meeting I think Dave you\u2019re still going to be around for that one, how prominent of a role will Darius play as far as presentation and what should we expect to hear in March from Darius?","Dave Cote","Well, they made room for my walker so I should be just fine. Darius?","Darius Adamczyk","I think we just kind of laid out in the finalization of laying out the agenda, but you should expect me to do the majority of the presentation that Dave normally does, obviously Dave will have a role at the beginning of the conference, but the expectation should be that I\u2019ll be leading most of the presentations that Dave led in the past.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Well, then I\u2019ll save the congratulations in farewell for them. Thanks a lot.","Dave Cote","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Hey. Thanks and good morning. I\u2019m glad everyone in such good spirits.","Dave Cote","But I kind of tell you, Steve, I really enjoyed your headline this morning. It\u2019s always nice to wrap up on a good quarter.","Steven Winoker","You\u2019re the best Dave. I can always count on you. Listen, I want to go back to the meetings that we had in December when you and Darius has talked about, you have used the word, animal spirits a lot and maybe the best describer of what you were seeing globally with your customer base. Could you maybe you know, it\u2019s been a month or so since then month and half. How has that changed?","Dave Cote","I would say, it\u2019s changed become more positive. I\u2019ve really been impress to see that improvement in animal spirits, small company CEOs, big company CEOs, a small banks that I\u2019ve talked to, really quite surprising, so the animal spirits are real, there is no doubt about it. And hopefully if we can just get a few specs here with some actual actions that could be enough to really start turn the herd. I don\u2019t think it takes us to crazy levels, the GDP growth and if it did that would be a problem. But I think we are going to see an improvement here, not ready to bid on it, we\u2019re going to continue to plan for a slow growth global economy, but it still feels more positive than it has in a while coming off of worst recession since the great depression.","Steven Winoker","Okay.","Darius Adamczyk","Just to maybe add one other comments about, I certainly would agree with Dave\u2019s commentary regard what we\u2019re seeing, maybe the one offset to that and I think our clarity sooner rather than later would be particular helpful would be on lot of a discussions and that\u2019s really what they are at the moment. Our discussions around the trade policies as they relate to both Mexico, China and some of the other trade partners that we have, so I think in our view that sooner that gets cleared up and resolved I actually think there could be a further uptick.","Steven Winoker","Great. You guys talked in your main comments about your prepared comments that safety and productivity and some of the issues there, but a little more color would be helpful on the supply chain especially in terms of these things \u2013 those issues are reversing, you expect this thing to get back to normal or is some sense of timing around a little bit more color would be helpful there?","Tom Szlosek","Sure. It\u2019s really goes around some of the issues were primarily around some of our voice and product lines especially it was due to a supplier issue due to a transition. We do expect those issues to be cleared up in Q1 and right now we\u2019re seeing a recovery plan that\u2019s in placed. So it did impact us. Think about an impact in their tens of millions of dollars, hundreds, but nevertheless it had a meaningful impact by Q4, we expect the whole recovery in Q1.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And just if I could, Solstice, the big backlog, how do you see that, I think you said, $3 billion, how do you see that playing, or how do you see that sequencing out over the next few years?","Tom Szlosek","We see it obviously accelerating this year and continue next year as particularly with all the European new cars having Solstice in them or competitive offering, and then the further acceleration in the U.S. So we continue to seek tailwinds for that product as we move forward and continue to expect that double digit growth rate both in 2017 as well we head into 2018 and beyond.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And sorry, just quickly on Steve\u2019s question and you said, your net exporter on tax, you guys report $5.5 billion I think on gross export, so there been some guesses out there. Could you just put a final point on the size of the import just to give folks some idea of the order of magnitude here in the delta?","Dave Cote","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something we report today. So I\u2019d just say, it\u2019s a goodly amount, I\u2019m not worried.","Steven Winoker","Okay. All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Dave Cote","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Hey, Dave, feeling a little nostalgic, this is last call. We\u2019ll see in March, but good work, congrats.","Dave Cote","Well, thanks. And I was going to wait till the end of the call, but you were , while you took some convincing you were also an early supporter and I\u2019ll not forget that either.","Jeffrey Sprague","All right. Well, you put it up, that\u2019s great. By the way I was guessing you might have been watching celebrity apprentice to try to get a read on who the next President could be? ","Dave Cote","I think they already had that argument, six or seven years ago, so I think you still got to be a citizen, I mean, born here.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple of questions, can you \u2013 perhaps to Tom, but just put a final point on anything we should know on the timing of [aero] incentive quarterly in 2017, you just kind of avoid any confusion or surprises to the extent that you do have visibility on timing?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. The way I characterise it, Jeff, overall it\u2019s a modest tailwind for the year. But the first half will be different than second half. In the first half it\u2019s actually headwind as we talk about for the first quarter. That does moderate in the second half, into result that overall modest impact year-over-year. I\u2019m talking less than 50 million or so.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. And then I\u2019m sorry if I missed it in the kind of the preamble, but also just a final point on commercial aero aftermarket if you could, large OE versus business jet and how flight hours track for you in the quarter?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. We expect in 2017 to be on aftermarket side to be largely aligned flight hours on the air transport side and that shows up in both the spares as well as repair overhaul businesses. I would say that there is a somewhat of a shift into the newer platforms that we talk about with the extensive build-ups on both air transport and business jet side.","And that changes the install base, the character of the installed base. It freshens it. It has more units under warranty. So particularly on the business jet side that can have a timing impact while you still under warranty in some of the new platform. So, we\u2019ll also on the business jet I hopefully track the flight hours, but you could see some little bit of a softness as a result of that fact that I explain. ","Jeffrey Sprague","But the actual performance in Q4, Tom?","Tom Szlosek","Actual performance overall on the business jet side was low single digit for both the spares and the [RO].","Jeffrey Sprague","And then finally, just I would imagine the pension funding took a nice repair here at the end of the year and was in pretty good shape anyhow, but is pension funding kind off the table for you guys in the foreseeable future?","Tom Szlosek","Yes. I would say that we continue to have obligations on international side. We have a number of plans. As I mentioned Germany and the UK, bigger one and there is modest contribution require there, but for the big U.S. plan it\u2019s in pretty good shape. We see no funding requirement for the foreseeable future.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right. Thank you.","Dave Cote","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Good morning gentlemen.","Dave Cote","Howard, how you\u2019re doing?","Howard Rubel","I\u2019m all right, Dave. You\u2019ve always watch headcount and you\u2019ve always been conservative in your forecast and there\u2019s a little bit have to in your numbers. Have of you gone back to the business units and make sure that there are some real confidence in that, I mean sometimes you have short cycle businesses and some there\u2019s obviously backlog, but what have you done to test your managers?","Dave Cote","Well, I\u2019ll let, turn the bulk of the question over to Darius, but what you mean by have-to?","Howard Rubel","Well, the second half of the year is where you expect a bit more of the performance than in the first half.","Dave Cote","Okay. Well, aero incentives play into that as Tom mentioned and just comparisons.","Howard Rubel","Yes, exactly, and I mean.","Dave Cote","So, it not, it\u2019s not like its ramp up or anything like that you have you got to have you got to believe in, it\u2019s not that bigger deal actually, but Darius has spend a lot of time on 2017 plan with the businesses, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Darius.","Darius Adamczyk","I think as always we plan and invest cautiously, so I think we certainly play in some investments particularly in the front end of the business in terms of sales and marketing and R&D, but we\u2019re certainly not going to spend all of that in the first quarter, because sometimes you can certainly get ahead of yourselves and we\u2019re going to be monitoring to see the growth is coming in and whether or not we can afford to make those investments and that going to phased throughout the years with triggers that will align with the kind of growth that we\u2019re seeing. So this is not a situation we got to kind of spend the full investment budgets in Q1 and then hoping that things happen, it just not the way you operate and won\u2019t now either.","Howard Rubel","No, I understand. But what are you doing in terms of head count for the year? Are you planning a modest increase, or are you planning on keeping that relatively stable?","Darius Adamczyk","All-in-all given the restructuring activities that we have plan, we think those going to be stable.","Tom Szlosek","We are definitely adding on the commercial side, I mean, its across the portfolio in aerospace, PMT and other place, we are adding headcount both in developed regions as well as high growth regions.","Darius Adamczyk","And just to add and I think you\u2019re going to also see a mix change because particularly in former ACS organization, but really throughout we took our couple of layers of management to increase organizational speed and decrease bureaucracy and we took some of that money that we saved and reinvested it back, particularly in sales forces.","Howard Rubel","And then one last question sort of talking about expansion in general and sort of two parts to it. One is you fixed a big chunk of your debt going forward, is the reason you still have the amount of CP outstanding, you are anticipating some benefit from cash that you can repatriate. And how are you thinking about deals for the year? I know it's always Dave reminds us every time, it\u2019s all about timing and that\u2019s not predictable, but within the context can you talk about possibly some of the areas you\u2019d like to enhance?","Dave Cote","Well, first, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. But right now CP is cheap, and we\u2019re well covered without credit lines. So it just makes sense to use it that way and we do. And you\u2019re correct, you foretold the answer on acquisitions, depends on what becomes available and is it a price that we\u2019re willing to pay. And Darius is not New Hampshire cheap, but he is cheap, so he\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know what adjectives he wants to put on it, but you\u2019re not going to see it diminishing in the discipline here.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I would echo what Dave said on the debt that\u2019s outstanding. Dave use the word cheap, I would say, CP is actually profitable and I just kind of leave it at that, but we do have an extra amount of cash on the balance because of that and we\u2019re trying to maintain the flexibility to expand opportunities come as Dave said, it\u2019s a good time to be taking advantage of that.","Howard Rubel","Thank you.","Darius Adamczyk","Howard, so I think just reinforce what Dave said, certainly it\u2019s going to be cheap, probably the word I would use is selective and really do our -- we always have done real diligence around what is that end market look like. What are its growth prospects? What\u2019s the competitive environment? What it\u2019s going evolved to? What are the disrupted technologies?","We\u2019re going to be spending what we have and we\u2019re going to be spending even more time in those elements to make sure that these are M&A strategy continues to be highly accurate, highly predictable and more in line with our financial objectives.","Dave Cote","And Howard, I suppose that before you go, I should add, I\u2019ll always have great memories of going to Red Sox games with you. But I\u2019ll also remember that you blew me off at a meeting at TRW and I just want to make sure I publicly stated it.","Howard Rubel","Yes, but there was a cheesecake that was made up in homage for that, if you remember?","Dave Cote","So I forget it, I\u2019ve going to be public of it not just private any more.","Howard Rubel","You\u2019re very kind.","Dave Cote","Yes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and Dave you will be missed.","Dave Cote","Thank you.","Joe Ritchie","I guess, my first question, in listening to Darius, it was interesting to hear that there's some thought, as things kind of shake out, that you guys could benefit once policies are set. Clearly, you're in an export position, but I guess, I\u2019m wondering Dave or Darius, how concerned are you guys about trade wars? Clearly, China's been a big growth engine for you.","And then also secondly, there's been a lot of tweets around defense pricing, having to come down. And so what -- how do you guys feel, your position there as well?","Ann then also secondly, there\u2019s been a lot of suites around defense pricing having to come down and how do you guys feel your position there as well?","Dave Cote","So, from -- to eco what that Darius said earlier, yes, you have to be worried about a trade war. If it gets to that point, it\u2019s not going to be bad just for trade, but it\u2019s going to be bad economically, it\u2019s kind of tough to be in economic island now especially if you are the number economy in the world. So it depends on how all that gets handled. And yes, of course it\u2019s a concern for us.","On the defense side most of our stuff, you heard me say this is in the past, but defense is more of sales channel for us, it\u2019s very little that we do where it just a single product solely for defense, it tends to just be another channel for us. So a lot of our stuff is already just done on a commercial pricing basis and I think that\u2019s kind of mitigates any potential impact for us.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Go ahead Darius.","Darius Adamczyk","Just to add to that, I think obviously lot of the discussion and I would put it very much there from a discussion and kind of back and forth. It\u2019s a obvious concern, because I think any of trade disputes particular as it relates to Mexico and China which are large key trading partners could be a detriment not just to Honeywell, but to the broader economy.","But firstly I remain optimistic and I think that this is going to get resolved in a manner which is constructive for all parties involved and right now we don\u2019t have anything definitive anyway other than pure speculation, so we do remain optimistic that it will evolve that way.","Tom Szlosek","And Joe, just to add to Dave\u2019s point on the defense side, many of our positions are not directly with the government. We are working with primes, and we\u2019re not a prime. And so, they are good at negotiating with us. And we commercial ranges with them as Dave said. And for the platforms that are getting all the attention recently, I mean we\u2019re very well aware what\u2019s going on.","I mean we\u2019ve been on ongoing even well before this of commitments around cost with primes that we serve is our primary customer. So don\u2019t want to dismiss their concerns, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re accustomed towards an environment that we operate in for years and we expect to continue.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. No, that's good to hear. And I guess, maybe as my follow-on question, it was nice to see the cash flow come through this quarter, and fully recognize that 2017 appears to be a little bit of a transition year on the cash flow. Maybe kind of talk us through again, kind of what's driving the kind of two point difference between your cash flow growth and earnings growth in 2017? And then, what's kind of the framework to think about 2018 and beyond for cash flow?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s been interesting year for us as far as cash is been concern, I mean we\u2019re clearly had some headwinds in the markets that we serve and the conversion, the first couple of quarters was not what we want it. But in the third and particular in the fourth quarter with the continued focus particular on working capital we\u2019re able to get that conversion that you saw, that was north of 100%.","Overall for the year 86%, we think that will improve as we head in the 2017, that\u2019s going to come from better working capital performances, it\u2019s not just in our supply chain and inventories but we have opportunities in receivables and in payable, so we\u2019re working all of those areas as well the CapEx that we\u2019ve talked about and it begins to moderate in 2017 and that moderation accelerates into 2018, so if we go from 1.1 billion which is that reinvestment ratio we talked about over 150%, we moderate that down to 110 or 104 or 105 2018 that gives us a nice boost as well to the free cash flow. So that should enable the conversion to continue to improve from 2017 into 2018.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We would take our next question from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for going along on the call. So Dave, just would love any thoughts you have on the pickup we saw in December. I mean, we've seen this pick up across the board. Obviously, the pro business [Indiscernible] we're hearing from DC is encouraging, but the quickness of the turn up has been surprising.","So I'm just wondering, do you think it's just the absence of uncertainties that we have regarding the presidential election, Brexit, et cetera, et cetera? Do you think it's oil and gas, I mean, what do you think has caused all of this pick up?","Dave Cote","Well, I do think and I\u2019ve said this for several years that I don\u2019t economist also really understand what happens after a severe financial recession, it was true that 30s and it was true of this one, and hit overall confidence was just really, really strong, really hard, and when you have the whole herds thinking about slow global growth and that\u2019s just the way it is and that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to work, well, it becomes self-reinforcing because we all act that way.","If you take the look at the conditions for recovery, it actually pretty good for while, they were been talking for number of years about how good consumer balance sheets were in the U.S. You look at capacity utilization, it\u2019s in good shape, unemployment down 4.5 or so percent, you can argue under employment, but still employment in good shape, our bank balance sheet in the best condition, they\u2019ve ever been, most companies balance sheets really good shape, and I really think it just need to spark.","And the election assuming that we \u2013 the right things gets follow through and we don\u2019t end up with some unintended consequences provide that sparks and I\u2019m really encourage by what I\u2019m seeing. Now it\u2019s got to turn into something, but right now the feelings are better than I\u2019ve seen them in long time and that could be enough to get the herd moving in the direction of saying, I\u2019d better not miss this moment as oppose to just hunker down and keep waiting it out. And that\u2019s another simple short explanation but I think that\u2019s probably the case overall.","Nigel Coe","Fair enough. I appreciate the color. And then, just to turn back to SPS. Obviously, it's been a challenging 2016 as per the plan. But obviously, we haven't had perfect transparency on this business in the past, large projects and inventory channel headwinds, and some of the obviously, the supply initiative you called out. Are these part and parcel of -- is this the nature of the beast, or was 2016 just a -- sort of a perfect storm of bad events? I mean, any sense on that you can give us?","Dave Cote","Yes. I think this more review 2015 or 2016 as much more been anomaly, that kind of status quo. I think we enough -- a confluence of events which were all kind of came together on time. Number one is obviously we talked lot about the USPS contract and that conversion. Number two is, we had that channel inventory issue that have to work its way through. Three is and this was more timing related than anything else. There was a shortage of larger deals that are notable, because of this business goes through distribution and some of it goes direct and those direct deals were few and far between not just for us but really lot of competitors as well.","And then four is I think we personally I think we\u2019re improving channel programs et cetera, so we do expect this business to very much return to its performance that its enjoyed for many, many years and use 2016 as anomaly.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then the channel inventories, so they level now where it comes sell out?","Dave Cote","I think most of that has been resolved, with one exception, but I would say, 70%, 80% of the challenge is behind us.","Nigel Coe","Right. And then just finally for Tom, he called out in the PR that interest expense, 8% below 2016 level. I mean, obviously I can do the math, but it implies that interest expense closer to $300 million for 2017, a bit below what we had? That is the right number?","Dave Cote","Yes, its sound about right, yes.","Nigel Coe","Right. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Dave Cote","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So some of your business tech customers have continued to cut production through 2014, you obviously didn't change your 2017 guidance in aero. So my question is, how much visibility have you had to these production cuts? And when you think about your overall negative 2% to 1% organic forecast for 2017 aero, do you have a decent contingency for more business [Indiscernible] already in your guidance, and is some stabilization in U.S. defense or commercial helo is something you were expecting, or maybe could represent a tailwind to your guidance?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes. I\u2019ll first start with the business jet. We for sure have the production schedules for the platforms that we\u2019re on with the large OEM. We\u2019ve actually been more conservative and we\u2019re -- had taken a conservative approach in the second half, when we\u2019re putting together the 2017 plan. So some of the cuts that actually you\u2019re referring to, we most likely had contemplated in the guide that we gave you. So we\u2019re not \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be caught off guard necessarily by what you\u2019re now seeing, hearing and reading.","On the commercial helo, that\u2019s a space as you know is heavily dependent on oil and gas, and perhaps the declines over 2016 were just reflective of what was going on in the market. I think we are going to still see some tepid conditions. I don\u2019t foresee growth for 2017 that we view it, consider very significant at all, but as the sentiment starts to improve in oil and gas is we articulated in the prepared comments we do hope that that will turn into some benefits. And you are already seeing some of the OEMs report on the helo side some modest improvement. So, hopefully that\u2019s a sign of things to come, we haven\u2019t built much of it into our plan is the way to think about it.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful Tom. We know that you've had more -- you will have more difficult comparisons as the year goes on in PMT, especially late in the year. But Solstice, you continue to ramp. You told us what the UOP backlog is its good, up 5%. [Indiscernible] just really remains steady, I would surmise that UOP should continue to be solid or improve, so why would sales growth drop from the 3% to 5% you're guiding to in 1Q, as you go through the rest of the year? Again is it just you need to be conservative, it's pretty a short cycle business, is that sort of the way to think about it?","Tom Szlosek","No, I think we\u2019ll take it quarter by quarter. We are seeing as we said a pretty strong backlog in UOP. And hopefully the orders that materialize in the quarter will contribute to that further growth. We are not trying to signal any sudden demise between first quarter and the rest of the year for that business.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right, thanks a lot.","Tom Szlosek","Thanks Andy.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead your line is open.","John Inch","Thanks, good morning everyone. Dave, why don\u2019t you ahead you left that GE appliances job. You\u2019d be working the Chinese otherwise.","Dave Cote","Well for a variety of reasons I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019d also say John you were \u2013 while we took a little longer to convince you were also an early supporter, so thank you.","John Inch","You're right. I wasn't that far behind, David. But you're right, I'm -- it takes me a little longer to kind of get moving in the morning. Trying to figure out how to top that trade wars question. Maybe I should ask you what you think of asteroids, but I'll leave that one for Darius. Hey safety was down 5% on the core. And the reason I ask this 3M's personal safety business is actually really good, and that company actually called out some selective pricing actions to try and stimulate some volume. Are you seeing anything competitively in that dynamic other than just the market? That's my first question.","Dave Cote","I don\u2019t think so John. Maybe I would say the growth rate that you mentioned in the mid single digit decline was largely the result of the supply chain and the challenges that we had and I think we would have been in line with the market otherwise and as Darius said January that gives us a nice boost for January and we get those issues behind us.","John Inch","Yes, that\u2019s fine. Just big picture, you guys are obviously not a beta company which makes you an investable company but if economy continues to percolate and lets\u2019 just hypothetically say your share is lag, what are your thoughts about really starting to leverage up the balance sheet and by your stock if you know the market is not willing to comply at least in the short run?","Dave Cote","Certainly that\u2019s been something that we contemplated, we talked about our approach which you know the foundation is to keep the share count flat with through buybacks and to opportunistically go after further buybacks as the market conditions look attractive in the fourth quarter. We did about 2 million shares of buyback which is more than we normally would and what I would say is that we are going to continue on that approach. I mean we do have a little bit of a restrictor in terms of where our cash is located. That most of the cash is overseas so we can\u2019t just take 9 billion of our overseas cash and put it in the buybacks, I mean its\u2019 just not practical. Should circumstances change around the new administration and tax quality and so forth we\u2019d obviously take a look at it, but right now our existing approach is to keep that share count flat and look for opportunities for displacement of the market to accelerate where we are...","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and I think overall John the approach will be similar to what\u2019s been. So we are going to be opportunistic in terms of both buybacks and if the tax environment does change and that transaction to bring that cash from overseas becomes a bit more frictionless you know we are going to review that and we are going to review it primarily two different things. We are already committed to growing our dividends at a rate which is faster than EPS so we said that, you know about our CapEx profile which is going to be elevated this year and then start tapering off. So basically it comes down to an investment in either buybacks or M&A. And a lot of that has to do timing and marketing conditions and what we see and what\u2019s available. But that\u2019s kind of our rough framework and just how to think about the trade offs.","Dave Cote","Yes it makes sense. I mean Darius obviously there is a lot of perspective that part of your mandate is going to be to try and move Honeywell\u2019s growth higher which you probably can\u2019t do even do some of it organically, but it\u2019s going to require some M&A and some of the software deals, it would be greater than Intelligrated but [Indiscernible] pricing especially the market up demand you have a bias in the short run just given the run is it \u2013 let\u2019s assume that cash was frictionless you didn\u2019t have these repatriation issues, would you be preferring deals over share of purchase right now or is it unclear?","Darius Adamczyk","It\u2019s really not that clear because it all depends what deals are out there and what kind of pricing. So it\u2019s hard to say I\u2019m definitely going to prefer one over the other. And I think in terms of yes, I mean I certainly hope to enhance our growth rate through some of the portfolio work that we have been doing and we\u2019ll continue to do.","Dave Cote","But I will also there is a flip to the other side of the coin here which is I think we got to continue to maintain our discipline around what we pay and branded some of the higher growth assets usually we hire higher multiples but I think we can \u2013 if we do our homework right and look real hard and I think an example of that, I think there is still an opportunity to buy assets by companies at attractive pricing.","Darius Adamczyk","[Indiscernible] ","Dave Cote","I don\u2019t quite buy the premise John. Our organic growth is...","Darius Adamczyk","A lot of that self helps here that we are doing around our usually launched commercial excellence, our [VPD] efforts which we are spending a lot of time as a company. So I think it really is a combination between what I call self help and continued work on our portfolio like we\u2019ve done over the last, especially over the last 18 months.","John Inch","Yes, makes sense. We\u2019ll see you in March. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Dave Cote","Thanks John.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Good morning.","Dave Cote","Hi, Andy.","Andrew Obin","So Dave congratulations and thank and Darius look forward to hosting the call going forward. So question on top line and margin. It seems that top line was impacted a little by the effects and you have taken up margin relative to December 14. Looking at the index, looking at the currency index, it seems pretty flat from a month ago, so just wondering what particular currency is driving it and the second just looking at high margin guidance by segment, how much of it is just effects and is there any self help built in to this I mentioned versus a month ago?","Dave Cote","Yes, Andrew when you go back to our guidance I mean we were pretty clear on the FX assumptions that we used for 2017. Our normal process is to update the FX rates at the end of the year. And so, when we do that, you end up with the impact mostly due to \u2013 if we had used for example one ten is our planning rate for the year. We changed that to 105 and that has an impact. The bottom line though is that the organic growth rates do not change, we\u2019re still calling 1% to 3% EPS still stays the same at that 6% to 10% growth and the cash conversion remains the same. So it\u2019s a matter of just picking the number and finalizing it as is our normal process.","Andrew Obin","And on the margin question?","Dave Cote","Yes I mean the change in the margin is solely due to lower sales in the same segment profit dollars, because as you know -- of course keeps our segment margin protected.","Andrew Obin","And then a question on China, they had a big stimulus last spring you guys if your trip this summer you did a very good job sort of highlighting the fact that there is a lot more growth in China then those people \u2013 thinking at the same time. We are sort of starting to see it in the numbers. Given that the party Congress is in the fall, how much juice do you think there is in this growth beyond 2017 and how concerned are you guys as to sort of growth decelerating into the second half of 2017 in China?","Dave Cote","Well it\u2019s kind of tough to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen to China economically to your point especially with their I guess homed elections coming up. But I think overall we are still long term believers in China, so whether they have a lower growth here than what they have had in the past. At the end of the day our prospects there are still extremely good and you look at all the businesses we are in, our opportunities to gain share, to get the tier 3 and tier 4 cities still just tremendous. So I don\u2019t see it having that huge an impact on our performance.","Andrew Obin","And if I can just squeeze one more, just some color on HBS you touched on it but can you provide just a little bit more color on region, which are positive and which are negative?","Dave Cote","I don\u2019t have that on my finger tips, it\u2019s probably good follow up question for Mark on the call later or you can talk to him later.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot.","Dave Cote","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave Cote for any additional or closing remarks.","Dave Cote","Thanks. After 15 years at the helm, this is my last earnings call as some of you pointed out. It\u2019s been an honor to lead the Honeywell team for this many years. And all of us are proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. I\u2019ll have to say we are even more excited about what\u2019s coming. Our outperformance will continue because we\u2019ve invested heavily in people, process and portfolio to do the seed planting that we\u2019ve always done. We do well today not just because of what we are doing today, but also because of what we did three and five years ago. That our performance will continue under Darius. He is just as driven as I am and he\u2019s smarter. We have many many terrific years ahead of us. This is an exciting time to be part of Honeywell and you\u2019ll all benefit from it.","Now while it is a bitter sweet moment or a time for me because it would be fun to continue running Honeywell in these great years to come. It\u2019s worth a little time to also focus on the suite side of it. Next weekend we will again celebrate that quintessential American Holiday, the Super Bowl. And in that celebration it\u2019s important to remember that we are all Patriots. Please join me in supporting and celebrating America\u2019s team. Thanks."],"10928":["Honeywell International Inc.

","Mark Macaluso","Thanks April. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis. ","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor.

We\u2019re excited to be hosting our call this morning from Charlotte, North Carolina, which will officially become our corporate headquarters on August 1. It is an exciting time to be part of the Honeywell team as we continue to transform our business into a premier technology company with Charlotte as our home base. ","Let\u2019s begin this morning on Slide 2. It was another very strong quarter for Honeywell. We again delivered on our commitments, generating earnings per share of $2.10 at the high end of our second quarter guidance, up 9% excluding the impact of spinoffs in 2018. This strong earnings result was driven by organic sales growth of 5% and 170 basis points of segment margin expansion. Notably, our segment profit excluding the spins, on a comparable basis to 2018 was up 9% this quarter and was the largest contributor of EPS growth. For the first half of 2019, organic sales growth reached 7%, which is a proof point to the investments we\u2019ve made in our business, in our sales force, and new technologies that are winning in the marketplace. ","We continue to see the benefits from our strong positions on key platforms in our long cycle business aviation and defense portfolios in aerospace, in our warehouse automation business, which is up over 20% organically year-to-date, and now generates approximately $2 billion in annual sales in our building technologies business, which had another great quarter. Our process solutions and UOP businesses, which principally serve the oil and gas industry, also both grew 5% organically this quarter as we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in the Honeywell connected enterprise, which drove double-digit organic sales growth of our software in the quarter. In fact, this quarter we signed a framework agreement to deliver Honeywell Forge asset performance management and improve the reliability and performance of over 1,000 industrial assets for a large Middle Eastern refinery.","Segment margin exceeded 21% in the second quarter, up 170 basis points driven by smart portfolio enhancements we made in 2018, our investments in the commercial organization, and the benefits of previously funded restructuring to improve our operations. Excluding the favorable margin impact from the spinoffs, segment margin expanded 80 basis points, which was 30 basis points above the high end of our guidance. Building on the progress we have seen for several quarters, we delivered 100% free cash flow conversion and we remain on path to approximately 100% for the second year in a row. I am encouraged by our progress in this area and we remain focused on continuing to drive improvements in working capital.","We also continue to extend our capital deployment strategy, repurchasing $1.9 billion in shares and closing four new Honeywell venture investments in the quarter, bringing our total to 12 new investments in the first two years of the fund. As a result of our first half performance, we are raising the low end of our full-year organic sales guide by one point to a new range of 4% to 6% and raising the low end of our full-year earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.95 to $8.15. We expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow for the year, and we have narrowed our free cash flow guidance to reflect this.","While we are encouraged by our performance this quarter, we are continuing to plan cautiously for the second half of the year given the uncertain macro environment in which we operate. We\u2019ve seen some slowing in certain short cycle businesses that has been overcome by the strong performance in the rest of the portfolio. We think it is prudent to plan conservatively in the event of a broader slowdown, given that nearly 60% of our business is short cycle in nature. ","I\u2019m very pleased by our performance in the first half. We still have substantial work to do to achieve our plan, but I\u2019m confident that the team will continue to execute.","I\u2019ll stop there and turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2019 guidance in more detail.","Greg Lewis","Thanks Darius, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin on Slide 3. As Darius highlighted, we delivered on our commitments again in the second quarter, building on the strong start we had in Q1. Organic sales growth and margin expansion performance across the majority of the portfolio was very good. ","A few highlights to mention - defense and space grew 20% organically and the commercial aftermarket in aerospace grew 8% organically with strong demand across both air transport and business aviation. Building technologies grew 5% organically after 9% in the first quarter, and process solutions and UOP, which encompass our oil and gas portfolio, both grew 5%. ","The impact of the spin-off of Garrett and Resideo, both lower-margin businesses, contributed 90 basis points of segment margin expansion. The remaining 80 basis points was the result of our strong operational performance, primarily in aerospace and performance materials and technologies. We continue to effectively manage the impacts of tariffs through well-executed mitigation efforts and are in the final stages of eliminating all spin-related stranded costs before year end.","Notwithstanding our strong performance across most of the portfolio, as we messaged in April and again in May, we did experience challenges in safety and productivity solutions, and more specifically in the productivity products business, which drove a sales and segment margin decline this quarter. I will address that in more detail in a minute.","Consistent with last quarter, the majority of our earnings growth - $0.16 - came through segment profit improvement. We realized a $0.06 benefit from our share repurchase program which resulted in a weighted average share count of 733 million shares this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, largely consistent with the outlook we provided of 22%. Importantly, we were also able to fund a substantial amount of fast payback repositioning in the quarter, more than $80 million, that will support our continued productivity focus, functional transformation, and supply chain initiatives that we discussed at our investor day in May. These proactive measures will be helpful in the event of a slower economy in the coming quarters.","Finally, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion with conversion of 100%. The strong cash generation was most notable in aerospace and building technologies.","We\u2019re very pleased with our results and are focused on continuing the strong performance in the second half. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 now to briefly discuss the second quarter EPS bridge.","Slide 4 walks our earnings per share from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019. As Darius mentioned, segment profit growth was the main driver for the quarter. That acceleration was most prominent in aerospace and PMT due to a combination of higher organic sales volumes, commercial excellence, and our continued focus on productivity. We also continued to utilize our balance sheet to lower our share count. We deployed nearly $2 billion towards the repurchase of Honeywell shares, consistent with our plan to reduce the share count by at least 1% during the course of this year.","Finally, we had a $0.05 headwind on an adjusted basis from below-the-line expenses, primarily due to the proactive restructuring actions I mentioned earlier and lower pension income year over year as a result of the derisking actions we took in 2018 that was partially offset by benefits from net interest expense and foreign exchange. Funding a strong pipeline of future repositioning continues to be a key lever for our productivity playbook and will serve us and our shareholders well as we go forward. The punch line here is we had another high quality quarter, delivering EPS at the high end of our guidance range. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and we can discuss our segment performance.","Starting with aerospace, sales were up 11% organically. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth and capped off an outstanding first half for 2019. Defense and space grew 20% organically led by global demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased spares volumes on U.S. DoD programs, including the F-18 and F-22. The defense business is well positioned. More than 50% of firm orders with delivery through 2020 are already booked.","In commercial OE, sales were up 4% organically driven by continued strength across the business jet platforms which more than offset declines stemming from the timing of air transport shipments. Notably we saw increased deliveries across all Gulfstream platforms and strong avionics deliveries on certain [indiscernible] platforms. Regarding the Boeing 737 Max situation, we remain aligned to Boeing\u2019s stated production schedule and will continue to monitor the situation closely, but as we stated previously, we do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell\u2019s operational results in 2019. ","Aftermarket sales were up 8% organically driven by demand across both air transport and business aviation and growth in retrofit, modifications and upgrades, including related to the ADS-B safety mandates. We continue to see good adoption of our connected aircraft technologies which drove strong software sales growth in aerospace and continued to gain traction for our JetWave solution across all aerospace verticals, as demonstrated by the C-17 win we announced in May, our first in the defense business. ","Aerospace segment margin expanded 330 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes, and margin accretion from the spin of transportation systems. The spin contributed approximately 60 basis points to aero\u2019s total margin expansion. The aero business continues to execute well, investing in future technologies, driving productivity and commercial excellence, and has a healthy long cycle backlog heading into the third quarter.","In Honeywell building technologies, sales were up 5% organically driven by global demand for commercial fire products. As Vimal Kapur and his team displayed at our investor conference in May, we are innovating and launching new products in this business at a much faster rate than we had in the past, and we continue to see good acceptance from our customers and strong growth as a result. We saw good growth across building management software platforms, including for Tridium, which as you may remember is our platform for integrating building management systems and data using open and proprietary communication protocols. ","In building solutions, we drove growth in global projects across the Americas and in the airport vertical in the Middle East. HPT\u2019s segment margins expanded 390 basis points in the second quarter driven by the favorable impact from the spinoff of the homes business. The team continues to make steady progress on our goal to eliminate the remaining stranded costs by year end stemming from the home spin. Segment margins excluding the favorable impact from the spin accretion were roughly flat this quarter, a big improvement from the first quarter, and we continue to make progress on supply chain optimization post the spin. Overall, it was another great quarter for the HPT business with double-digit projects backlog growth in building solutions positioning the business well for the second half of 2019. ","In performance materials and technologies, sales were up 4% on an organic basis. Process solutions sales were up 5% organically driven by continued strength in our short cycle businesses, primarily in software, maintenance and migration services, and field instrumentation devices. We also saw growth in smart energy primarily in North America. The short cycle backlog of across process solutions is up over 12%, giving us confidence that the growth in the automation portfolio should continue into the second half.","UOP sales were up 5% organically driven by growth in licensing and engineering, as well as refining catalysts. We saw particular strength in North America with reinvestment in existing refining infrastructure and select new investments in petrochemicals, and strong backlog conversion in the Middle East. UOP orders and backlog were both up over 10% for the quarter. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis UOP orders in China were up double digits, primarily driven by growth in equipment, licensing and catalysts. ","Organic sales growth in advanced materials of 2% was driven by demand for our Solstice line of low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents; however, this was partially offset by lower pricing due to the impact of illegal HFC imports in Europe. Enforcement and monitoring of the EU F-gas regulation has been an emerging challenge and we\u2019re working diligently in partnership with other producers, EU regulators, and EU member countries to address the harmful illegal imports. Overall, PMT segment margins expanded by 140 basis points in the second quarter, driven by commercial excellence across all lines of business, direct material productivity, and further improvements in our supply chain. ","Finally, in safety and productivity solutions, sales were down 4$ on an organic basis in the quarter as segment margins contracted 420 basis points. The weakness we saw this quarter was principally in our short cycle, high margin productivity products business. Similar to the first quarter, we saw a combination of continued distributor inventory destocking, fewer large project rollouts in the mobility space, and lower channel sell-through. The second quarter sales mix in SPS negative impacted our margins as the volume declines we experienced were in more profitable parts of the business. ","We continue to see growth in our sensing and IoT business and robust demand for voice solutions and aftermarket maintenance and services in warehouse automation. As Darius mentioned during last quarter\u2019s earnings release, Intelligrated is beginning to face tougher and tougher comps as we get deeper into the year following five quarters of approximately 20%-plus growth. We are seeing timing of new major system rollouts push into the second half of the year. This effect coupled with tougher sales comps in the second quarter drove flattish sales in Intelligrated in Q2. The large project order push outs we saw in Q2 are consistent with our customers\u2019 latest planning and not an indication of project losses. Intelligrated\u2019s aftermarket business, which enhances customer outcomes through consultative engagements to improve productivity, was up strong double digits organically driven by demand for comprehensive life cycle support and service. The business is benefiting from the large installed base growth in the core Intelligrated portfolio. The outlook for this business overall remains very strong and we delivered organic sales growth of over 20% for the first half of 2019, and we continue to expect this to be a growth business long term. ","Within the safety business, organic sales growth was 1%. We saw continued demand for gas detection products, which grew low single digits organically, and retail footwear, which was up high single digits organically. That was largely offset by decreased volumes in general safety and personal protective equipment. In our key end markets for the safety business, we see solid demand of portable gas detection in the U.S. but slower activity in the industrial sector, given distributor inventory levels.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 and discuss our third quarter outlook. Our planning assumptions are largely consistent with the second quarter dynamics with some further caution on short cycle. We expect our growth this quarter will be driven by a combination of continued long cycle strength in aerospace and defense coupled with short cycle demand in building technologies and healthy backlog in UOP and process solutions. The aerospace business, as I mentioned, has grown 10% or more organically the past four quarters and we expect continued strong performance due to the order growth rates and backlog in defense. We\u2019ve established a significant backlog of new major system awards for Intelligrated over the past year that will drive growth into 2020 and allow for an expansion of our shorter cycle aftermarket and service businesses.","We are taking a cautious view on the short cycle growth as many of the macro signals - the China GDP, U.S.-China trade tensions, and Brexit, just to name a few - are still clouding the economic outlook. We think it\u2019s prudent to plan conservatively given the uncertainties, and our Q3 and second half guidance reflect that.","As it relates to the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the U.S. government and potential sanctions from China, we see no reason why Honeywell would be potentially sanctioned by the Chinese government and we have received no official word from the Chinese government that Honeywell is on a sanctioned list of entities. ","Now let\u2019s discuss our segment outlook. In aerospace, we continue to see robust demand in both business aviation and in U.S. and international defense, supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs for orders with delivery into 2020. Air transport shipments should increase sequentially driven by demand for A-350 and A-320 aircraft and lower customer incentives. We will see tougher comparisons in business aviation given the significant organic sales growth in the third quarter of 2018. Consistent with last quarter, we expect that commercial aftermarket activity will be driven by flight hours, airline demand, and further tailwinds from the adoption of safety and compliance mandates, principally in business aviation. ","In building technologies, we expect good growth with strength primarily in commercial fire products in Americas and EMEA and growth in building management software in high growth regions and for Tridium. On the service side, we expect to see building solutions growth continue given the large order funnel and considerable backlog growth in projects and services. As a reminder, HBT does have significant short cycle exposure particularly in the products vertical, and although we haven\u2019t seen order rates flow, we are planning cautiously here in the second half.","In performance materials and technologies, we expect to see short cycle demand for products and services and process solutions and growth in equipment, absorbents and refining catalysts in UOP. We saw good bookings in equipment and catalysts in the second quarter and growth in the process solutions service bank for new contracts and renewals, which we believe sets PMT up for another good quarter in the third quarter. ","Finally, given the challenges we experienced in productivity products and our assumption that the inventory destocking continues for the balance of 2019, we are expecting to see continued headwinds in SPS from both a sales and segment margin perspective, but anticipate that will moderate in the fourth quarter. We expect Intelligrated\u2019s third quarter performance to be similar to Q2 with 20%-plus growth in the aftermarket business but slower large project growth. We maintain a robust backlog of project awards from blue chip customers and see a very strong pipeline of potential awards in the third and fourth quarters.","The net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, will be minimal this quarter. The difference year-on-year is driven primarily by lower pension income, the benefits from spin indemnification payments partially offset by higher repositioning funding. ","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 7 to discuss our revised full-year guidance. As Darius noted, e are raising the low end of our full year organic sales, earnings per share, and free cash flow guidance. Our organic sales guidance moves one point in the low end to a new range of 4% to 6%, while our segment margin guidance is unchanged. Our revised earnings per share guidance of $7.95 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of 8% to 10% adjusted, excluding the impact from the spins in 2018. We remain on track to deliver approximately 100% free cash flow conversion.","Our position on tariffs is unchanged. We expect no significant impact in 2019 given the proactive measures we have taken to mitigate. We also continue to closely monitor the Brexit situation and are communicating regularly with our customers, partners and suppliers. As we stated last quarter, we\u2019re planning for various potential Brexit outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit scenario, to ensure that as the terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU are finalized, we are well positioned to continue meeting our customers\u2019 needs. ","Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share count of 731 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Our net below-the-line expenses are now expected to be approximately $120 million in 2019. This reflects slightly higher reposition expense charges partially offset by greater interest income.","We continue to be confident in our ability to execute and in our outlook. We\u2019re sticking to the playbook around short cycle caution given the macro uncertainties that remain in the second half of the year. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Darius, who will wrap it up on Slide 8.","Darius Adamczyk","Thanks Greg. We are encouraged by the performance from our businesses thus far in 2019. We continue to execute on our commitment to share owners, are generating strong organic growth in many end markets, and have multiple levers to enable further margin expansion. Our operational performance is generating strong free cash flows and conversion while investing in the business to ensure we are well positioned for the future.","I\u2019m also encouraged by our progress with the business transformation initiatives we discussed at our investor day, particularly given because of the significant opportunity I see in these areas in the future of Honeywell. Let\u2019s be clear - we have a lot of work to do to execute these initiatives, but I continue to be excited by the energy and enthusiasm I see across the employee population to move the ball forward and truly differentiate Honeywell from our competitors.","With that, Mark, let\u2019s move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso","Thanks Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions. April, if you could, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question is coming from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning everyone. Nice quarter. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of questions around the short cycle commentary. I heard you guys say cautious a few times during the prepared comments. As I think about your business today and the safety and productivity solutions side, maybe talk a little bit more why you expect the destock to last and what\u2019s really driving that through the fourth quarter. Secondarily, in that business the commentary around new major system rollouts being pushed out, I\u2019m just curious whether you guys are seeing any saturation in that market.","Darius Adamczyk","Let\u2019s maybe take that in two segments. Number one is we anticipated some level of destocking to occur. I mean, obviously the distributor levels weren\u2019t supported by the level of business, so what we\u2019ve projected for Q3 and Q4 is some level of moderation, but certainly a continuation of the trend in terms of softness in that end market as the destocking continues. Obviously our plans are a bit better than that, but what I don\u2019t want to do is in the short cycle business, I don\u2019t want to be forecasting too aggressively and then end up disappointing, so that\u2019s kind of what we have baked in particularly into the Q3 outlook, which is still negative, and moderating a bit more into Q4.","One of the things we\u2019re trying to really assess, you know, how much of this is market and how much of this is us. That\u2019s still unclear. From the early indications we had, the market is getting softer; but again until we see all the data points and some of our competitors\u2019 report and piece all that together, we\u2019re really not sure. For now, we\u2019re going to assume it\u2019s us, because I don\u2019t want to just say well, it\u2019s the market so we don\u2019t need to do anything. I can tell you, we have a very aggressive commercial program to address some of these challenges and to drive business at the end user level.","The good news here on productivity products is this is not a technology issue. We actually have very good technologies. They\u2019ve been successfully launched, most recently in Q2 around our warehouse business and our TLC, which is our strongest segment, so I\u2019m very encouraged by that. That\u2019s really the story on SPF-- or I should say, on productivity products.","In terms of Intelligrated, it\u2019s a very different story. Intelligrated has been growing by strong double digits, like think well north of 20% on average for the last several quarters. What\u2019s happening there is simply some of the orders that we expected in Q2 got pushed out a little bit. They\u2019re still out there, we expect to book them in Q3, Q4. We didn\u2019t lose them - I know that for a fact, and the business is going to continue to grow and we\u2019re very bullish on the business, so there isn\u2019t a greater or a different story here. The business is gaining share, it\u2019s performing extraordinarily well, we see a little bit of a blip in delay in terms of the order bookings, and that\u2019s what we accounted for in our outlook.","Greg Lewis","Yes, I would also just add that the aftermarket business, which as you know--you know, capturing the installed base and then going and mining the aftermarket is a big part of that whole thesis, is doing terrific. We\u2019re up over 20% on the LSS business and have been for multi quarters, and as you know, that also carries a higher margin profile so I think that part of the playbook is working nicely.","Joe Ritchie","That\u2019s helpful to hear. Obviously, we\u2019d prefer for you guys to be prudent as your planning assumptions go for the second half of the year. I guess in that vein, you started the year off with roughly 7% organic growth above where your organic guide is for the year, long cycle backlog still plus-10%. What is then the embedded planning assumption for the short cycle businesses? It seems like you\u2019re planning for very, very low growth, if any growth, in short cycle in the second half of the year, and maybe what are some of the puts and takes you\u2019ve got there.","Greg Lewis","Well again, Joe, the productivity products one is a big contributor to that, but you\u2019re right - for the remainder of the short cycle businesses, I would say outside of maybe the aerospace aftermarket, we\u2019re planning for low-single digits. Again, as we\u2019ve seen, that can turn very quickly, so we don\u2019t want to get too far out ahead of our skis there.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think you have it right, Joe. Think LSD for short cycle, think MSD to maybe even a touch higher for the longer cycle, depending upon the segments, but that\u2019s sort of the rough math. The punch line is we are planning somewhat cautiously for the second half because the geopolitical and the economic movements are pretty volatile right now, and what we try to do is we try to guide that somewhat cautiously based on what we\u2019re seeing today. The short cycle is somewhat unpredictable and can turn very quickly.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, thanks guys. I\u2019ll let others get on the call. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. ","John Inch","Morning everybody. I think, Greg, you had mentioned that you are taking proactive steps for Brexit, in case there\u2019s a hard Brexit. What exactly does that mean? Does that means you\u2019re sort of stockpiling--","Greg Lewis","Yes, it\u2019s really about certifications, John.","John Inch","Okay.","Greg Lewis","Yes, it\u2019s really about certifications and making sure that certified bodies in the EU are going to allow the product flow to continue. So, we\u2019ve been basically recertifying our products with other EU bodies, as opposed to the UK bodies that we have many of our certifications through, and that\u2019s been an ongoing effort. We\u2019re substantially complete at this stage, which is very good, and then we\u2019re just also setting up additional triage in terms of actual movement of goods in the event we need to do anything special or different in terms of air freight or premium freight in that sense to get product to flow. Those are really the two things that the teams have been working most closely on, and you can imagine too when you think about that even from our own internal wiring, there\u2019s systems changes and so on that need to allow those things to be true for us internally as well, so that\u2019s what the teams have been furiously preparing for so that we\u2019re ready no matter which way this goes.","John Inch","How did Europe and China do as regions? I remember China was down a little bit last quarter, obviously given some of the shorter cycle stuff going on there. I think Europe was more resilient. Was there any sort of real change, and change in terms of China and the regional impact, like the Malaysia, Middle East impact? Is there anything else that you would call out there?","Darius Adamczyk","I\u2019ll take that one, John. I think overall we\u2019re pleased. I\u2019ll highlight a couple of things, for example our PMT bookings in China were around 20% in Q2, so some real strengths. We had some tough comps, think flattish to slightly up for China for Q2, but that\u2019s driven by particularly some of the tough comps that we had in PMT. Overall, obviously there\u2019s some level of concern for the China economy, but overall given the bookings we saw in PMT, that was strong.","Europe stayed strong, think low to mid single digits for us, some spotty in places. Germany was strong, Italy not so much, but overall really good growth rates for us. Middle East was very, very strong. We\u2019re very encouraged by that. India was up double digits, very strong growth there, LatAm doing well, so for the most part we\u2019re still seeing pretty good growth across the globe. Granted, China maybe wasn\u2019t what it was last year, but also not a complete meltdown and move downwards, so overall we\u2019re still encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing out there.","John Inch","Darius, do you feel that the backlog of restructuring projects that you have would be more than sufficient if the cadence of the global economy continues to soften a little bit, or would you actually be looking to do more projects? Obviously you guys are pretty aggressive in terms of your playbook historically. I\u2019m just--","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, well John, I think that\u2019s the highlight--that\u2019s maybe one of the highlights of the quarter. I think we really invested in our future this quarter. We had some very, very attractive restructuring projects, and we wanted to make sure we fund them. We probably could have delivered even higher EPS results in Q2 if we didn\u2019t fund those, but we thought it was prudent, particularly in this level of economic uncertainty, to fund those restructuring projects now, particularly given the kind of pay backs we saw in those.","But the real answer to your question is I guess it all depends upon how much of an economic hit we would take. We\u2019re kind of protected to the levels we\u2019re forecasting. If those economic cycles are deeper than that, then obviously we\u2019d have to do more, so it\u2019s a bit of a wild ride, as you can see right now, with news items coming every day. But we do what we do all the time, which is we plan cautiously, more productivity, and if the environment is worse than we anticipate, then we\u2019re going to take another round of cost actions to offset those. ","Greg Lewis","Yes, just so you know, the repositioning pipeline is a process just like a sales pipeline or an R&D pipeline. We\u2019re working that at all times so that we are ready when the opportunities present themselves from a funding perspective, and obviously as the economic environment moves, so that\u2019s absolutely part of our routine at all times.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks very much guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone. Maybe we can follow up on some of Joe\u2019s beginning questions on the push-outs that you\u2019re seeing. For Intelligrated, the push-outs, are they attributed to anything in particular? Is it macro uncertainty? Do you have any sense of what\u2019s driving the delay in capital commitment? Then similarly, one of your competitors in process has been talking about seeing big project push-outs out of the second quarter into the third and fourth quarter. I\u2019d be interested if you\u2019re seeing some of those dynamics as well.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I\u2019ll start with Intelligrated. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a single cause for that. Some of these projects are fairly substantial from a capital perspective, and there\u2019s timing around board meetings and so on, but we have an indication from our customers that these projects will happen, so I don\u2019t anticipate they\u2019ll result in cancellations. The timing is always unpredictable on large projects. We expect some of those to land in Q3. It wouldn\u2019t shock me if they land in Q4, but they\u2019re not disappearing and they\u2019re not being cancelled. ","In terms of the large projects, PMT had a pretty good booking quarter overall. It was stronger in UOP than it was in HPS. We\u2019re seeing something somewhat similar on the large projects per se - those are sliding to the right a little bit, but we saw some other strong bookings particularly on the shorter cycle, some of our services business, our advanced solutions, our software businesses, so it\u2019s been a bit of a mixed story when it comes to larger projects, maybe perhaps those are sliding a little bit to the right. But our backlog grew, our bookings were good in PMT, and we anticipate a pretty strong second half of the year. ","Deane Dray","Across the shorter cycle portfolio and the softness that you\u2019re seeing, are you seeing any competitors beginning to use price as a weapon here to drive some volume? Take us through the portfolio and where pricing may have seen some of that pressure. ","Darius Adamczyk","I think all short cycle isn\u2019t the same. As we look at HBT, I think our short cycle has actually stayed fairly strong. I think the results speak for themselves, it\u2019s been a really good first half for our HBT business, and we actually are expecting that to continue into Q3. The business is doing very, very well.","In SPS, it\u2019s the productivity products issue that we talked about earlier. I can\u2019t really necessarily point to price. I mean, as the market is softer, pricing becomes more of a challenge - some of that is definitely true, but I don\u2019t want to point at competition, that this is necessarily any kind of a pricing thing. I mean, yes, there is greater level of competition when markets get softer - that\u2019s true.","Greg Lewis","But we\u2019ve had--I mean, we\u2019re getting price and we\u2019re getting growth still in the short cycle currently, again with the exception of the productivity products story, and then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the HFC business, that\u2019s one place where we\u2019re seeing a very specific competitive move going on with some of the illegal imports coming in, into Europe. That\u2019s really the only place that I would highlight as something really visible that we can see competitively. ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. ","Scott Davis","Good morning guys. You guys are putting up pretty predictable numbers each quarter, and it just begs a question, you spent a good chunk of the investor day talking Forge and connectivity and all these interesting things you\u2019re working on, and also the supply chain stuff. Is there any way to measures your progress in these areas, like for example the big margin gains you had this quarter, could you ascribe any of that to supply chain, or is that still out there to come?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, let me start taking this. I think in terms of a lot of our ISC transformation, I can\u2019t--you know, we are in the--we\u2019re not even in the top of the first. We\u2019re grabbing the bat at this juncture, so that\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to see a lot more pronounced really in 2020 and beyond. We\u2019re just getting started, so I\u2019m not going to tell you there\u2019s a lot attributed to the ISC transformation. You probably shouldn\u2019t expect much until 2020 and beyond.","In terms of Forge and our software play, I think that really the best way to measure that business is growth. That\u2019s the single biggest metric I use and is it profitable growth, and I was very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing - double digit software growth, margin that\u2019s accretive to Honeywell, margin that\u2019s very attractive, and we\u2019re gaining traction, we\u2019re winning jobs. We pointed to a large Middle East win that we had, which is very large in scope, and our customers trust us, so I\u2019m very pleased with the strategic progress we\u2019re making.","But our measures are typically financial in nature, because you can make yourself feel good by looking at actions. If you look at financials, and especially for Forge and connected enterprise, ultimately we look at the growth rates and they\u2019ve been double digits, which is good, which was unexpected.","Greg Lewis","Yes, and the other thing I guess I would highlight is internally, we\u2019re looking obviously at recurring revenue streams and trying to continue to enhance our recurring revenue streams, so that\u2019s something that as we measure the progress in the connected, that\u2019ll be one that we watch as well pretty closely.","Scott Davis","Okay, makes sense. I just have a question about Intelligrated and the sales cycle. When you install--when you do the big project, presumably there\u2019s some sort of warranty period. When do you start getting aftermarket from those installs?","Darius Adamczyk","It\u2019s after the completion and turning over the project over to the user, because a lot of times we\u2019ll get the service contract as soon as the job is complete, and granted there are some things that are under warranty, but we\u2019re trying to have the same approach with the Intelligrated business as we do with our HPS business, where we have these longer cycle, the Assurance 360-type of contracts, and we\u2019ve had great traction in that, over 20% growth in Q2.","By the way, I\u2019m not indicating any kind of a slowdown in this business. I don\u2019t think we can expect the 20%-plus growth rates that we\u2019ve seen, but we think that this is going to be a high single digit, double digit growth kind of business. ","What we\u2019ve seen that although the push-outs of the orders, although disappointing, the good news and the fact that our strategy is working is this, which is our services business was up over 20%, it enabled that business to have an accretive margin to what it had last year, and the strategy we\u2019re trying to execute is working. Unfortunately we can\u2019t control the timing of when the orders land, but I can tell you that they\u2019re not due to losses.","Scott Davis","Just a quick follow-up on that. At what point does aftermarket become a bigger piece than the install revenues? Is it three years out, five years out?","Darius Adamczyk","To be honest, Scott, I hope not for a while, right, because that means that our project cycle is slowing. But you know, it\u2019s a bit of a function that still the projects business is the predominant component in that business, so what would have to occur is the services businesses are already growing at over 20%, the projects business slowed a little bit this past quarter. I actually hope that we get more of the projects, and I think that will happen. I don\u2019t think that this is now the sign of, oh God, the warehouse automation segment is slowing. I think that this could be a blip for a quarter or two and it will resume, but that\u2019s really kind of how things will work, is ultimately the projects business will slow down - I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily now - and the LSS is going to become a bigger growth component of the business. We kind of saw a little bit of a preview of that in Q2, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long term trend yet.","Scott Davis","Okay. Good luck, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. ","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning. Just so we\u2019re all on the same page here on the SPS thing, how should we think about the absolute profit for the third quarter, and then I know you guided to something like a $1.1 billion or something like that for the year, are we kind of just south of a billion for the year now when it comes to profitability? Then just as a follow-up, a pretty big miss - you guys were out at EPG not too late, but late May. Did something change significantly in June, or was this something that you knew about but there was enough offset in the rest of the portfolio that you didn\u2019t feel the need to call it out?","Darius Adamczyk","Steve, let me start with the second comment and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg. In terms of SPS and more specifically productivity products, I think we called it out both in our Q1 earnings reports and John talked about it at our investor day. I think that we were pretty clear that this is going to be another quarter where we\u2019re going to see destocking and some challenges on commercial, so I think that--you know, was this a little bit greater than we anticipated? Yes. Did we signal it? I think we did, and maybe specifically didn\u2019t talk about it at EPG but we certainly did at our Q1 earnings call, and John talked about it specifically at investor day. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re shocked by what we saw. Like I said, it\u2019s a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated, but not totally out of whack with our expectations.","Greg Lewis","Yes, then on the profitability front, Steve, I think given the mix of sales that we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s going to look fairly similar in Q3, so I would expect margin rates to be in that same range of 11%, 12% type margins in the third quarter. Fourth quarter should get a little bit better, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it as we exit the second half.","Steve Tusa","Okay, so 225 to 250 in the fourth quarter, something to that extent on segment profit?","Greg Lewis","Yes, the margin rates are going to be in that--again, similar range.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last quick one. When you guys talk about short cycle, to me when I look at the results - you know, commercial, aftermarket, and some of the shorter cycle stuff in PMT, building technology is perfectly fine, you\u2019re really--you\u2019re not necessarily talking about all short cycle. It seems like it\u2019s an SPS type of dynamic, and how bad was the scanning and mobility side, the stuff that you compete with Zebra on? How negative was that in the quarter?","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think that\u2019s right, Steve - this story is really about productivity products. That was what we signalled, a little bit worse than we thought, it wasn\u2019t a good outcome, and it was down for the quarter, so it was a little bit down, more down than we thought. Some of that is--you know, my guess, although I want to emphasize I don\u2019t know yet, because I always assume it\u2019s our issue, not a market issue, I think there was obviously some issues in the market and market slowing. We\u2019ve had some early data points which would indicate that and some commercial execution things that we need to fix, as well as really the destocking thing was the biggest factor. Frankly, the inventory levels really exiting 2018 are unsupported by the business levels, and some of our distributors are taking actions to do that. So that\u2019s really kind of the negative story. You\u2019re right - it\u2019s not widespread, it\u2019s predominantly limited to one business which didn\u2019t have a great Q2.","Steve Tusa","Yes, and that\u2019s why you guys planned conservatively for the second half. Thanks a lot, appreciate it. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gautum Khanna with Cowen & Company. ","Gautum Khanna","--$1.9 billion of stock in the Q, I think that\u2019s a multi-year record or close to it. Are you still thinking $4 billion repo in the year, and then also another--a second question is, if you could please just speak about the M&A pipeline and whether or not you\u2019re seeing anything attractive. Thank you.","Mark Macaluso","I\u2019m sorry. This is Mark, can you repeat the question? We missed the first part of it.","Darius Adamczyk","You got cut off in the beginning.","Gautum Khanna","Oh, I\u2019m sorry about that. My question was related to the stock repurchase - you bought $1.9 billion in the quarter. Are you still thinking about $4 billion for the year? The second question was if you could just give some color about the M&A pipeline and whether you\u2019re seeing anything attractive. Thank you.","Greg Lewis","Sure. You\u2019re right - $1.9 billion was a fairly healthy amount of repo in the quarter. I think we\u2019re about $2.6 billion on a year-to-date basis, and all of that is still aiming at getting the 1% reduction from year to year, so $4 billion for the year is probably in the right neighborhood of where we\u2019ll land. Obviously some of that depends on the share price performance for the remainder of the year, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable assessment of what the end of the year will look like.","Then as it relates to the M&A pipeline, we continue to be active. I wouldn\u2019t say we have--you know, other quarters, we\u2019ve come in and talked about having things that were right at the one yard line that didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think we had anything that was quite that close in this particular quarter, but we continue to be very active across all four of the businesses, and then as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re ramping up the activity particularly in HPT, given the fact that that business is now on much firmer footing. ","Gautum Khanna","Okay, thanks. If I can squeeze one more in here, what are the demand trend expectations for PMT in the second half? What sort of growth are you looking at for those--for UOP, HBS and advanced materials?","Greg Lewis","Think about that as mid single digits. Again, with the backlogs that we have entering the back half of the year, we think mid single digits is a very reasonable spot for PMT. ","Gautum Khanna","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeffery Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you, good morning everyone. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on SPS for good reason, but let\u2019s talk aero for a moment. The margins were extraordinarily strong there, stronger than I might have guessed given the mix. I know you\u2019ve got some commercial-like margins in part of your defense and space business, but can you give us a little bit more color on what really played out in the margins in the quarter and how you see the rest of the year playing out there? ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I think that margin growth is really a testament to the execution prowess of the aerospace team and a lot of our strategies are working. I think sometimes we forget that our software business isn\u2019t just in Honeywell connected enterprise, it\u2019s also in our avionics franchise, and that group has done a tremendous job in really shifting its focus through RMUs and upgrades and enhancements, and we saw the benefits in that because it obviously has accretive margin rates. They\u2019ve done a great job at driving productivity in the business, so although--you know, this is that ultimate combination we also want to see, which is you drive productivity while getting good growth and you really expand the margins.","Obviously focus on the connected enterprise and connected aircraft is helping margins as well, good growth on spares. The BGA market is very, very strong right now, both in terms of OE and aftermarket. It\u2019s a testament to a lot of the great wins we\u2019ve had on the platforms, but also supporting our customers in flight. And then lastly but certainly importantly, defense and space has just been on fire and just about any segment to want to look, we\u2019ve been there, whether it\u2019s helos, whether it\u2019s the U.S., international defense, all those segments are doing well.","I think this is really an important fact, Jeff, that as we look from now through the end of 2020, end of 2020 we have more than 50% of the business already booked, so we\u2019re really in really nice shape as we look into the future.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Great, thanks for that. Just back to this China question, I fully understand your position and statement this week as it relates to this. I wonder if you have seen or how you would keep an eye out for maybe more subtle pressures, not only on your but obviously your--you would see it in your own business, but any indication that U.S. or western companies are just getting a little bit of the cold shoulder around the edges, or any other kind of behavior change in the business that you\u2019ve picked up.","Darius Adamczyk","No, I don\u2019t. I think as Greg pointed out, I know we\u2019ve received interesting press on this subject, but we have seen no indication from China authorities that there are any sanctions coming our way. We have received no sanction. I think I\u2019ll point to a couple of things. Number one is we received our first Jetway order in China, which is very promising. I mentioned the PMT bookings in China were very, very strong in Q2. China is an important market for us, we play it locally, we have a lot of manufacturing, a lot of R&D facilities in China, it\u2019s a market that we take great pride in serving local for local, and we expect that to continue.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just a first question around overall cadence of demand in recent months. Your organic sales growth was 8% in Q1, it\u2019s guided at the midpoint at 3% in Q3, so a pretty severe slowdown with comps that are not that different. Aside from what you\u2019ve talked about in SPS, have you seen any changes in demand in recent months? Several companies talked about June being materially worse than the rest of Q2. Just wondered what you\u2019d seen recently in that respect.","Greg Lewis","Hey Julian, it\u2019s Greg. We haven\u2019t seen any really clear patterns like that across the portfolio that would cause us to say that June is the beginning of a huge slowdown, so across the portfolio I would say the answer is no. But as Darius mentioned earlier, the portfolio is not one thing, and so I expect that we\u2019re going to see different dynamics across the different parts of the portfolio and across different parts of the globe. Darius talked about the strength in Europe earlier, and there\u2019s a lot of strength there because the aerospace business is doing particularly well, and as long as flight hours stay strong we expect to see Europe continuing to do well there. The dynamics in China, as we mentioned, are strong on the long cycle side with UOP orders, so we\u2019ve got a very strong backlog in PMT in the short cycle businesses.","So far, the answer, no real pattern down, but it\u2019s something we absolutely watch as you would expect.","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, and just to maybe add to that, actually if you look at June on a year-over-year organic growth basis, it was our best month. Now granted we saw some softness in SPS which was pronounced, and that\u2019s why we have a bit more of a cautious guide for Q3. That\u2019s really the reason, is we\u2019re not expecting a miraculous turnaround in SPS in Q3. Some of the softness we saw in June, we actually anticipate may continue and that\u2019s why you see our guide, but overall if you look at total Honeywell organic, June on a year-over-year basis was actually our best month of the quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you for that detail. Maybe just picking up on your last point, Darius, within SPS, the warehouse and workflow solutions piece, revenue growth there was 7% in Q2 after 50% growth in Q1. What should we expect in the second half in terms of warehouse and workflow solutions sales trends specifically? Do you expect to pick up from Q2 as some of those orders get realized, or you\u2019re leaving it as sort of a single digit growth assumption for now?","Darius Adamczyk","If you\u2019re referring to productivity products, which I think there\u2019s kind of two different components, we don\u2019t expect a major turnaround here in Q3. Like I said, we still expect that to be negative for Q3 and some level of moderation in Q4. As it comes to Intelligrated, we\u2019re still expecting high single digit, double digit growth for the year. Q3 is a little bit dependent upon exactly when we land some of the orders, but think about--you know, we\u2019re now getting into the tougher and tougher comps, so we\u2019re thinking about single digit kind of growth rates for the second half. But again, just to be clear, that\u2019s depending upon when those orders come, because we\u2019re ready to execute those and we have every indication that they\u2019ll land. Obviously getting those sooner in Q3 would be better; getting them later or pushed out to Q4 would be worse, and that\u2019s a little bit tough to predict, but I\u2019m very bullish on our ability to secure those orders when they do land. That, I\u2019m not that concerned about.","Julian Mitchell","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","The final question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys. Just a couple of, I guess, more clean-ups than anything else. I think we\u2019ve beaten SPS to death, so hopefully John can take the rest of the day off. On aerospace specifically, clearly commercial air aftermarket doing very well. I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing unsustainable there particularly as it pertains the Max grounding, maybe with some of these older aircraft filling the schedule that aftermarket gets a little bit of boost and we shouldn\u2019t expect all of that to continue. I know the trend line is good, I just didn\u2019t\u2019 know if there was a little extra that you got out of the quarter. ","Darius Adamczyk","Yes, I would say this - there is probably a little bit of that, where you had more older aircraft flying vis-\u00e0-vis, but that\u2019s not going to have the kind of dramatic impact on our results. I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s really the cause and effect. I think as long as the air miles stay strong, as long as the economy stays in reasonable shape and people continue to fly business aircraft and buy business aircraft. Defense and space business - like I said, we\u2019re already more than half booked for the next 18 months. Things can always change, but overall we\u2019re not--this is not an area where we\u2019re concerned. We should have very good visibility to Q3 and Q4. Obviously this is a long cycle business. Short cycle continues to look strong, so overall I don\u2019t think that this is some kind of a blip or unusual event here in Q2. I think this is evidence that our strategies are working the aero team is executing.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just back on the topic of inventory, I know that that\u2019s clearly driving some of the activity in SPS, but as you look back on maybe the second half of \u201918, are there any businesses that now with the benefit of hindsight you can say, maybe we saw distributors take on more inventory than perhaps they were selling through and it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching a channel here and there, that you can share with us or we should keep in mind as we go into the second half? ","Darius Adamczyk","Like you said, hindsight is always 20\/20. I think the distributors to some extent play the same role we do, is they want to be prepared for good markets and they want to be prepared to sell out product, so could you say that they took on a bit more inventory than they should have? Well, yes. Hindsight, that\u2019s clearly the case. Yes, you\u2019re right - we are watching days of inventory, we are bringing that down. It came up out Q1, it came down in Q2, we\u2019re planning to have it again come down in Q3 and get it to a much more lower level. That\u2019s really the--you know, if we want to focus around the negative punch line of the quarter, and overall I think this was a very strong quarter for Honeywell, but if we want to focus on the negative, which is fair, that\u2019s really the punch line. We\u2019ve got to get those inventory levels moderated to levels that our distributors are comfortable with, and we planned that for the first half, we\u2019ve got a little bit more to do in Q3, and we\u2019ll see around Q4. Obviously the variable we don\u2019t know is sales out, because if that goes up, then we have leftover product; if it goes down, we\u2019ll have more work to do. ","So short answer is yes, we\u2019re monitoring it and we\u2019re going to be very closely watching it here for--well, forever, but certainly for the second half of this year.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.","Darius Adamczyk","I want to thank our share owners for their trust and support of Honeywell. We have made great strides in 2019 but we still have a long runway to continue our progress. We are focused on continuing to outperform for our share owners, our customers, and our employees. ","This quarter marks the start of a new era for Honeywell in Charlotte, North Carolina and I could not be more excited about what lies ahead for this company. Thank you all for listening, and have a wonderful, relaxing and safe rest of the summer. Take care, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today, as always, our Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.","This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com\/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today.

Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter. We saw good growth in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket and Transportation Systems in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT.","Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously-funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls. We are, again, raising the low-end of our 2016 full-year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70 or up 8% to 10% year-over-year, given our first-half performance.","During the second quarter, we had several announcements that I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO, effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond.","Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The Board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.","In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into two new segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into two smaller, more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have two fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.","Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past two years, will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace, Transportation Systems and most recently, ACS, where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies, like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor.","We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing install base of customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and they serve a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year.","We also announced the spinoff of our Resins and Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well and we expect completion this year. These portfolio changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our great positions in good industries.","In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth region. The trip covered four cities in five days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, visits to innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HGR business review.","This trip served as an excellent venue for our share owners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, East-for-East and East-To-Rest, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.","And our focus on software continues with the announcement of our new Digital Transformation business, part of Honeywell Process Solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. The industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio where we introduced our new Uniformance Suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides real-time digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable information. At the User Group Conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today.","Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently and reduce unplanned downtime.","We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've taken to mitigate potential risk, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our cost and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded-restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior software capabilities and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on slide three, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw continued growth in our Commercial Aviation Aftermarket, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides.","The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew nearly 30%, while in China Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial models and the sales from our seven recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high-single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.","Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range, or up 50 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis, so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentives and raw material pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, segment margin improved 110 basis points, and we expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.","Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also, we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter, as expected. On share count, we've repurchased another 500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our share owners.","Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase in free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow-growth environment.","Slide four provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, and as well as the five other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable-end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our Commercial Aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.","For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses in UOP which bottoms out in 2016. Also, the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS and the softness in our services and international business within Defense and Space, as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.","We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.","Slide five provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives led by the deployment of HOS continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus and the Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins.","Our factories and sourcing organizations continued to mature. Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously-funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.","The other impacts you see on the slide combined for a $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the eight deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated but the net results from all acquisition should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large one-time costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models and, as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers has been outstanding.","Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach resulted in a euro rate of $1.24 for 2015 versus $1.10 for 2016. Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our install base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.","Lastly, below the line items and share count were a net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04 respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were at an average price of $106 per share. So, overall strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.","Let's move to slide six. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, palletizers and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine controls and software.","Intelligrated software offers warehouse execution systems, a scalable suite of software that manage the entire fulfillment process including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and putting technologies. Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are a fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing install base which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position in the approximately $20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there are significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification. Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global megatrends namely e-commerce, software and automation with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year.","S&PS was built initially through acquisitions which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements; a good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter and we're excited about the opportunity this acquisition has to offer.","Let's turn to page seven. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties and we've received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time and thus may cause greater uncertainty in the short term in addition to potentially slower UK and EU economic growth longer-term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change but as a reference point, our core organic sales in the EU region have held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region.","In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.","Let's move to slide eight and discuss the aerospace results. Sales declined 1% or 2% on a core organic basis, below our expectations, primarily driven by weaker than expected sales in Defense and Space which I'll explain further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis as higher volumes with OEMs and Air Transport and Regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in Business and General Aviation. The BGA OE business in particular faced a difficult prior-year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.","Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales continued to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spare side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX Aviation sales including SATCOM and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased in line with flight hours which remained strong in the second quarter as well. Defense and Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior-year comparisons in the international business, as larger projects were completed as well as lower sales to key channel partners.","Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs, but we continued to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continued to be impacted by declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV, the satellite communications acquisition which has performed well this year.","Transportation system sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light vehicle diesel business in Europe which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth in light vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.","Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points or 80 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Let's turn to the ACS results on slide nine. ACS sales increased 9% reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A, a big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter. And we expect ongoing acceleration in the second half of the year.","Sales in energy, safety and security, so the products businesses were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in Security and Fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China business, overall, in ESS grew high single-digit in the quarter and we saw double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions, driven by our Connected ACS China strategy and the benefit from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume in S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the Distribution side, with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our video, access and intrusion product line. In Building Solutions, we saw modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by a decline in the project businesses.","But we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half 2016. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The Building Solutions Backlog and Service Bank increased low single-digit in the quarter on an organic basis. Segment margins, ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact from restructuring and commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than the last quarter and we expect this to continue in the second half.","I'm now on page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS would be split into two newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that with you. The first, Home and Building Technologies will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise which comprises our legacy Environmental and Energy Solutions, including Elster, Security and Fire, and Building Solutions and Distribution businesses. E&ES' industrial combustion and thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past three years and has been with Honeywell for over nine years.","The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business comprising the former Sensing and Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new SPS will be led by John Waldron, who is currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility.","Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile and we think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead to faster decision-making and a more efficient organization.","This announcement builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and five other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio. And we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions. We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure, effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.","Let's move to slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance, in what continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. So starting with UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the first quarter.","In gas processing, we secured five new domestic wins in the first half. However, that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remained strong and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and the UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.","Process Solution continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation, technology field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the Global Mega Project backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations remained strong in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. Through the recent mega project wins, HBS continues to build out its massive install base which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.","Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis driven by a challenging pricing condition in Resins and Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand in more than 20% growth for Solstice low global warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand. As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be tough, but our businesses in PMT are doing well and we expect an even better second half.","I'm now on slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned. So, for total of Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, that's up 4% to 6% reported or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter end. Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points excluding M&A or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.","Starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double-digit driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued declines in Business and General Aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single digit. Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit again with strength in both airline and business jet fare sales, including higher SATCOM and other software upgrades.","Defense and Space sales are expected to improve sequentially but will be modestly down on a year-over-year basis, as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior-year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind downs and a continued softness in U.S. services.","In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low-single digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives beyond favorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to Air Transport and Regional customers. Now, this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.","Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis, driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis led by continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. In BSD, we're expecting low- to mid-single digit core organic growth driven primarily by continued strength in Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets.","Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS' reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. Sorry, third-quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points.","In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat \u2013 or expected to be flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business. Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.","HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis driven by continued conversion of Global Mega Projects, as I mentioned earlier, as well as higher software and service sales.","Advanced Material sales are expected to be up low- to mid-single digits on a core organic basis driven by strength in Fluorine products softer sales and improving specialty products volumes benefiting from new product introductions.","PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points, and down 70 to 90 basis point, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity net of inflation.","Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 (sic) [2016] expectations by business compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking toward our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.","In Aerospace, Commercial OE continued see improvement in ATR with the ramp-up of key platforms like A350 and A320 as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half.","Meanwhile, our Commercial Aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year-to-date, driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and overhaul activities.","Defense and Space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.","In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower largely due to lower volume and our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by double digit core organic growth performance in the first quarter and continued strength in Americas Distribution as we move into the second half.","In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the Global Mega Project backlog. Our software solutions are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue for the remainder of the year.","And UOP activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our Gas Processing, Licensing and Equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.","Moving to slide 14, as Dave mentioned, we're raising the low-end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.","In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion, so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense and Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planned spinoff of Resins and Chemicals.","Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points, or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management.","We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares.","Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.","Let me move to slide 15 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half, adding to our strong performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once again we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments, even with limited help from the macro environment \u2013 a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell operating system.","And we again put to work a sizable amount of shareholder capital in the quarter, including 1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and 0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth. The uncertainty in macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline, where we have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out. We're making small bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives and continuing our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity.","We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix aligned to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will continue to outperform.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You going to make it, Tom?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I'm on my last leg here. Without further ado, let's move to Q&A.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tracy. Tracy, if you could please now open the line for questioning?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Scott.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Scott.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I hope you don't mind. We just got the EMTs in here for Tom.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was going to say maybe a shot of whiskey might help out a little bit. Or if Cote would give you day off once in a while, you might actually be able to stay healthy.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Scott, yes.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You can put the brakes on me.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Anyways. Dave, I love it when management teams use words like strong 2Q with a negative 2% core growth rate, so I'm going to call you out a little bit. The only time we've seen negative core growth at Honeywell, Dave, is when we've actually been in a recession. So like, what's different? What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year? Because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too, it's just not just you guys. But I mean negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess I'm asking a general question on what you think about the world.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong: if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points which is consistent with what we were doing last year. It's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year it's not.","If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that. And the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance.","Now you could say, okay, it is 2% negative core organic. That's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted, was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past, and that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which \u2013 well all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean you know what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that and we do believe that in 2016 that ends. This is the bottom for that sector.","If we take a look at the Sensing and Productivity Solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by Scanning and Mobility, where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service order last year that we're \u2013 in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just is. It would have been impossible to make that up.","Our Resins and Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line; does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense and Space where there's just been delays in orders in the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil and gas has been difficult. Well, those headwinds stop. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall and yeah, I understand the point about the minus 2% but we also forecasted it, it's not like it came as a surprise.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The other thing I would add to that, Dave, is the Aerospace incentives...","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah, good point.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...which come off the top line as well.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And those are significant. The Aerospace incentives are a huge increase year to year and they show up as a reduction of sales and income. And those, they're about flat year-to-year 2016, 2017 and then they decline. So again, it's a headwind that ends and isn't a growth headwind for next year by much.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In fact, it helps us that we're building install base and it drives the future service business for that business.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I look at all of that Scott. I feel pretty good about this, especially in what's not an easy environment.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, no, I get it. If you go back to your guidance two quarters ago, negative 2% would've been off the table but yes, I think you've performed about as good as you can do with that kind of a growth environment. I'm not busting your chops on that. Just lastly, UOP catalyst coming back, returning the back half of the year and my understanding is it's always been a very high margin business. Is your guidance a little bit conservative on the back half PMT based on that?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll never say it was conservative, we'll say that we think it's what we're going to achieve.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I mean as you can...","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But you've got a tailwind there that's pretty material I would imagine, right?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, you appreciate the lumpiness we've had that comes with being in that business. But we have very good visibility to the second half ramp, Scott. In fact, when you look at the third quarter, more than three quarters of the catalyst sales that we foresee are in backlog and ready to go. And in the fourth quarter, we're near the same position that we've been in the past in terms of the percentage of backlog that we have. So there's little bit more wood to chop for the fourth quarter but we have good line of sight and good visibility and yes there is a step up but the team is confident in being able to execute on it.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank, Scott.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, guy.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on Aerospace. There's a headline that American Airlines is deferring their 22 A350s and if you looked at the press, at the local press in Arizona, it sort of was writing about big layoffs and furloughs in your Aerospace business back in May. And I understand that a lot of the stuff is temporary, but can you just talk more about the Aerospace cycle, why such big sort of unusual furloughs in the Aerospace business? Are you worried about the direction of the commercial aerospace cycle? Just connect the dots for us. Thank you.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On the volume side, ATR actually feels fine. The biz jet industry is struggling a little bit and we expect that will continue. That will be offset by all the new platforms we've been on. When you look at the layoffs and furloughs that you're referencing, a lot of that is being driven by just better and better efficiency within our Aerospace business. Tim has been doing a remarkable job of just making all our processes work better. Whether it's how we engineer, how we manufacture, how we run our staff functions, it's really just being driven by doing a better job, overall, which is a good sign. That certainly puts us in a much better position to grow.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow up on Defense and Space, international orders, international is supposed to be a big area of growth, you talk about deferrals. How much visibility to have into 2017 and 2018 on these delays? Thank you.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I mean, the backlogs are holding up and as far as Defense and Space goes, the challenges for us were more in I'd say the commercial helicopter market. And a lot of the other defense companies that have commercial helicopter business, separate those out. We've got ours right in the Defense segment. And with the number of used aircraft available, as well as the declines in the drilling activity, you've seen a reduction in spare parts and services and that's impacting our portfolio there.","Your guess is as good as ours in terms of where oil prices are going and when the volumes will turn. But we feel pretty confident that we're at or close to a bottom in UOP and we expect that to kind of prevail through the rest of our portfolio as well. So we expect to see this improve. The technology that we have in commercial helos is outstanding, top-notch, and we serve all the big helicopter manufacturers and have very strong aftermarket business as well. So it should turn for us, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And I'll echo Scott's remarks on good performance in tough markets. Thank you.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Appreciate it, Andrew.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just talk about the moving parts with a little more detail on ACS in the second half? Maybe just give us a little bit of color. It looks like obviously pretty back-end loaded type of a trajectory, and I guess there's some acquisition snap-back in there, maybe just give us some color there?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I mean, when you look at the third quarter for ACS, we're calling flat to up 1% fourth quarter in that same region, down 1% to flat. So it's a little bit more conservative actually than what we've seen quarter-to-date. We had a very strong first quarter, as you remember, Steve, up I think 5% or 6%; a little more modest in the second quarter. So I think we've actually built the second half fairly conservatively in ACS. We'll get some improvement in S&PS, particularly in the fourth quarter to help us get that growth rate.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what are the margins in the acquisitions going to do specifically? I know you guys were \u2013 they were very low-single digits in the \u2013 you know, the big bucket of deals, they were very low-single digits in kind of the first half here. What do you expect out of those in the second half?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I mean, you saw the dilution in the margin rate overall for ACS. It was on order of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. That will moderate as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter. So overall, it'll be a margin improvement for us. And by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we'll have very strong 100 basis points improvement in ACS on an organic basis.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question just on the, you know, Dave, you talked about at the Investor Day the 4% to 5% or whatever it was, revenue guidance for next year. How does that stand today? How do you feel about that today after reducing your expectation for the second half?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the conditions that generate a 4% to 5% increase are still there. We'll see what the numbers actually look like as we get on further through the year, but all the basics are still there. When you take a look at Aerospace, it's still a case where you don't have this big increase in incentives that hurt you on the growth side year-to-year. The biz jet applications, even in tougher market still help you. UOP does bottom out this year. Some of the CapEx expansions that we were talking about in PMT are still there for us next year or are still there for us next year when we look at Fluorines in particular and what we've been able to achieve with some of the acquisitions.","When you look at ACS, we still expect that to be a good performer for us again next year, although, of course, split into two pieces. So the conditions are all still there. What the macro environment looks like, as we get into that year, I guess we'll have to assess as it moves on. But all the conditions that we talked about are still present.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Nigel.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I hope, Tom, you've recovered from your seizure. So I just wanted...","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","His EMT has got him on the machine. He's doing fine now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, that's what I can hear in the background. Okay, good. Just obviously the trends in the UOP backlog have been really encouraging. I think you mentioned 10% growth in the backlog year-over-year. You're obviously calling for an inflection in the second half on catalysts. I'm just wondering, how much of that backlog right now speaks to 2017? And does it allow you to make any adjustments about 2017? I hear the comments about UOP troughing this year, but I'm just wondering if the backlog speaks to 2017 in any \u2013 in some way?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, go ahead, Tom.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, to me, the visibility is stronger, obviously, Nigel, in the \u2013 for the second half of the year. But in terms of our planning for 2017, we certainly are expecting significant improvement overall in UOP, on the equipment side as well as in catalysts. I mean, remember, we were down 35% in the first quarter and something like 17%, 18% this quarter. That's going to start to improve in the second half with that building of the backlog. The team is very confident in terms of both the second half and their ability to generate orders to support 2017. The full visibility of the full year obviously isn't there, but in terms of what the leaders in the business see, and we've just went through the five-year planning exercise, which had a heavy focus on the earlier years. There's optimism in terms of what the market conditions are going to hold for us in 2017.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And just building on that, just the absence of a decline will be a significant benefit.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Yeah, I'd absolutely agree with that. And then...","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Has been pretty significant.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I mean, no, that chart showing the divergence between the portfolio I thought was really helpful. A quick one on the ACS re-segmentation. With Alex leaving and the re-segmentation, what does that mean for the Connected ACS initiative? Is it the same initiative, just in two pieces now? And do you think that both of those segments can be 20%-plus margin segments?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. I didn't quite get the last part of that, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You talk about ACS being a 20%-type margin.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Do you think that both of those can be 20%?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, starting with the last one first, we'll have to see how that plays out on the Homes and Building side because now all of the Distribution and Building Solutions business are in there, and they tend to be lower margin. So I haven't gotten far enough on that one yet to be able to say that's going to be 20%. But the overall, putting the two together, yes, that can still get to 20%. So how that will shake out by business will take some time for us to sort out.","On the Connected ACS, yeah, that potential is still there. It will continue to be there. It's just going to be into two pieces, so think of it as Connected Homes and Buildings Technologies and Connected Safety and Productivity Solutions. That's still going to exist, and there is just terrific opportunity for us morph these two more focused enterprises. I think of it as one is more commercial and industrial and the other is homes and buildings. It just allows us to be a lot closer to our markets than we have in the past with that same Connected ACS approach, which I think is going to really speak well for us and allow us to do a lot better in those markets than we even have in the past.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, all.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Dave. That Intelligrated acquisition is great, but thinking about the $25 billion or so you talked about in M&A, should we expect more like that now? And how are you looking at the pipeline? What are your thoughts on M&A playing out from here?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the story doesn't really change from anything we've said in the past, Steve, that, yeah, we've got a lot of money to deploy and that gives us a lot of flexibility. And you've seen us do it in different ways, M&A, repurchases when we thought it made sense. And the M&A pipeline still looks really good. We have at least 100 companies we're looking at in any one point in time, from small ones to big ones. Tough to predict when they're going to become available or when we can do something, and it's not like it comes in a steady dose.","Sometimes you get three or four right away. Sometimes you go a year and a half or two years with not much of anything. I can just promise you, it's top of mind for all of us, and we've got a pretty strong, good effort working on it to constantly look for stuff that will make sense and generate good returns for our share owners. We're still \u2013 money is not burning a hole in our pocket. It never will. It's important for us to be smart about how we deploy that money. In the meantime, we're going to focus on making sure we generate a lot of it, and this quarter was a nice indication of that.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And how do you see the construction cycle playing out in risk to that in HMB or I guess I'll call it HBT now?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, construction cycle still looks fine and whether it's commercial or residential it still looks okay. It's not like it's a boom but by the same token it still seems to be coming back pretty steady. Tom, I don't know if...","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I guess I would say that in ACS that was the strongest vertical for us in the quarter and it has been for the last couple of years, mid-single-digit growth at least in the businesses that serve the commercial segments.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And that's baked into your 2017 assumption that that continues, right, that 4% to 5% you've talked about?","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, for the most part.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty much. Yeah, we pretty much assume that continues just the way it is, so slow steady growth, not a boom but not a decline either.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I could just \u2013 one more, Dave, with the announcement for Darius and you're not exactly hands-off, what do you plan to focus on as Executive Chairman versus CEO once we get past that March? I mean, how should we think about the role that is effectively a new role and still a transition, I'm sure, over that following year for you?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I've built a special closet to keep Darius in from time to time. This is by the way \u2013 I think if you take a look at our history, when it comes to transitions and how we do things, I think we tend to do things pretty well and think them through. And, yes, I'm very hands-on, Darius is very hands-on. He wouldn't have got the job unless he was. He's an independent thinker. He's going to be important for the evolution of the company. And, yeah, it's going to be important for me to recognize the difference between my job and Darius'. We get along really well or at least at this point Darius says we get along really well, so it feels that way. But at the end of the day, I don't foresee a real issue doing this. We can manage it and we want a great transition because I still own a lot of shares, Darius owns a lot of shares, we want this thing to work well. So, I don't foresee it being a real issue.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, no, I didn't think there was an issue, it's more just about what do you see doing in the role than anything.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It'll be more advisory than anything else, because there has to be one guy running the place, otherwise it's just chaos. And until March 31, I run it; starting in April, Darius runs it. And that's going to be...","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...we've made that very clear to everybody around here.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning. So, hey, Tom, in the third-quarter, fourth-quarter as part of your third-quarter walk, I know in the first quarter you had some extra selling days and I realize you're not like a daily sales type of company, but if those come out of the fourth quarter, does that have any sort of discernible bearing I guess on growth in the quarter or anything else?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say it's reflected in the full-year guidance that we've given. We've fully contemplated those factors, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So there's nothing discernible. I didn't think there would be but I just wanted to double check. David, I want to pick up on Steve Winoker's question. You had an incredible run and I guess many of us sort of thought that you would be sticking around a little bit longer. And so now you're sort of doing a big ACS restructuring which I understand the logic, it all seems pretty positive. What are sort of the implications of perhaps you leaving or stepping aside a little bit sooner? Is it that there's lot of say growth initiatives the company has been looking to do and that you've sort of decided that maybe Darius should be assuming this on his own or perhaps there's M&A implications? I'm just curious, it's almost a personal question if there's something you could share with us.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you mean like am I running out of gas, so I need a younger guy to be able to keep the energy level of the company up?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I didn't mean it that way. We're all running out of gas but I didn't mean it that way. It's more the implication of strategic initiatives for the corporation and next steps and all that sort of stuff.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, you shouldn't be reading any big implications into any of this. This is just a case where I am 64. At some point investors start to look at and say, hey, we like you Dave but like what's next here and how do we make sure this continues. We've got a really good guy in Darius and he's ready now. There's no reason to wait. And better off, like Belichick, I guess, would say is better to leave a year, two early than a year, two late, and I think it's important to get the timing right.","We agree on the initiatives that we want for the company. We both agree on the need to outperform, and how do we do that. I think if you were to talk to Darius, he'd talk about the need for HOS Gold and the breakthrough initiatives, the need to develop our software capability even further. What we're doing in high-growth regions ends up continuing to be important.","All that being said, all this stuff is going to evolve. It's never a case \u2013 I've never felt that way where a strategy was permanently correct. Rather you needed to keep adjusting. You needed to keep evolving, whether you are a person, a company, a country, you've got to keep evolving, and we've done a lot of evolving over 15 years. And I think you can expect Darius to keep it evolving for the next 15.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Appreciate the comments, Dave. Thanks very much.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Happy to help.","Operator","And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I have two questions. Dave, you've done a nice job over time in ACS with doing a lot of product line extensions, or what I'll call business extensions. How do you think about \u2013 I mean I know with this separation of the two companies \u2013 how do you think about where you go from here with the opportunities?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I think both are going to be extremely good, and you take a look at what's possible in the homes and buildings sector, especially with our installed base, and the increasing need for software-capable products and services. It's quite entrancing with what can happen there, and having a more intense focus on it, I think is going to be very good for us.","On the commercial and industrial side with John Waldron, we're going to see the exact same thing, and the push that we've made with Intelligrated is going to help greatly there. The warehouse space we feel is going to be tremendous for a long time to come, especially with the development of the e-economy. And that's going to play very well for us, especially as you look at what we do with barcode scanning and how that fits. I'm really quite entranced with what can happen there.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","All right. You bring a little bit of \u2013 I guess you've said it before. It's sort of the power of a big company, but the challenge of being an entrepreneurial one at the same time.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And that's exactly the point of HOS Gold and what we're trying to do, and you combine that with the breakthrough goals that Darius has been a big supporter of and I think has improved significantly just in the three months that he's been doing this \u2013 puts us in a really good position. There is a lot of good growth to come out of the two businesses.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","To turn to Aerospace and growth for a moment, you have a fairly substantial connectivity initiative, and also there's a fairly significant change in the avionics market with the demand for ADS-B. Could you first for a moment talk about the progress you've made with the connectivity initiative? And then again, it looks like the pent-up demand for ADS-B remains, and at some point how are you going to convert that into satisfying it?","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, on the connectivity side, things are going very well there, and this really is a far superior product. The thing that's been going on right now is, while it exists, every airframer needs to get it certified so that it can be put on the aircraft.","Demand is very good. We just need to be able to get the certifications done with the airframers so that we can get it out there. I'm pretty well-convinced that when consumers actually start to feel the difference between existing services and what we're able to provide with a JetWave, we're going to be quite impressed, and it's going to get to a point where consumers ask for it. And it's going to be a differentiating item for airlines, for their consumers.","Interestingly, some of the surveys that have been done show that on a three-hour flight or less, passengers prefer a strong Wi-Fi to access to a bathroom, quite significant when you look at it that way. And we're really hot on what this connectivity initiative is going to be able to do for us. And on ADS-B, it's typical with any mandate is that it seems to all be backend-loaded as customers wait. And we'll be prepared for it.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Joe.","Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, and I think I'll shoot with the \u2013 and go for the bathroom instead of the Wi-Fi. But...","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Suit yourself.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, maybe...","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just don't sit next to somebody who chose Wi-Fi.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Exactly. Maybe just a broader question, Dave. We've been spoiled for so long the quarters, you guys have just continued to beat on the segment EBIT line. And recently, really the last couple of quarters you've just been digesting a lot, whether it's UTX, the leadership transition, M&A. Yeah, how do you respond to maybe some of the concerns that are out there right now that perhaps like you \u2013 management capacity has been strapped; the focus hasn't been as rigid as it had been historically. Maybe some thoughts around that would be helpful.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think this is one where you've got to look at the record. And just \u2013 I mean for simplicity, just compare last year to this year. Sales growth was tough last year, also. It was a difficult environment last year. And we kept breaking out the margin rate improvement chart to show, here's the operational stuff and here's all the other stuff that just goes on top of it, and focus on the operational piece because the rest of the stuff can disappear.","Well, this year it's just gone the other way. The operational improvement is still pretty darn good and consistent with last year. And if you look over on the right-hand side, in this continued slow-growth environment, just like last year, it's just going the other way is all. But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very good in a slow-growth environment. That parts not changing, and we're the same company that we were before. And what we're trying to do is just highlight these kind of swing items and say, don't focus on these. We're not asking for credit when it goes our way, and you shouldn't be dinging us when it goes the other way because the fundamentals of the company are still there, are still good and portends for a very good future for Honeywell share owners.","Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Joe, I would add to that and I would say that in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean when you look at the items that brought us back to a recorded margin rate that was lower than that 110 basis points, they're either items that are \u2013 will turn for us or that are of an investment nature. So for example, if you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of $1.24 last year to $1.10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 and some of the hedging we've done, so that will be an actual \u2013 at our tails next year.","And when I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million of P&L impact from the increased incentives. Those level off next year and actually help us to build an install base for service opportunities. And in the longer term, those decrease. So it'll be another tailwind for us.","And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done eight acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the size of the ones we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step up, the integration team cost and the like. And those will all turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future.","We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talk about. But those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own, if you compared how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell, so pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Couldn't agree more","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Dave Cote for any additional or closing remarks.","David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In a difficult environment, we continue to outperform for our investors. That's not going to change. The fundamentals for us remain as good as you saw in this quarter with our performance and our confidence in again raising our guidance for the year, this time to 8% to 10% growth. Rest assured we're going to continue to deliver. And we hope you all get to enjoy a great summer. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."]}}
