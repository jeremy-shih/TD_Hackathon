Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Currens","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings review. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the information on our 2012 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information. ","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at www.duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze Duke Energy\u2019s performance.  In addition to our normal disclosures, we have included additional information on our regulated wholesale business as well as updated estimated earnings base figures by jurisdiction through 2015.  ","In today\u2019s call as Jim and Lynn will review our first quarter highlights and briefly update you on our near term priorities, including our recent regulatory activities.  Additionally, we will discuss trends in our customer usage patterns as well as the economic conditions in each of our service territories.","Finally, we will review our quarterly earnings consideration for 2013 as well as our overall financial objectives.  After their prepared comments, Jim and Lynn will take your questions.  ","Now let me turn it over to Jim.","Jim Rogers","Thanks, Bill.  It is good to have you all on the call today.  We are now 10 months into the merger with Progress Energy, and I am very pleased with how we are executing our plans.  Our first quarter performance built on our momentum in 2012.","For the first quarter, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02, compared with $1.13 for the same quarter a year ago.  Even though below last year, our quarterly earnings are on plan.  As a result, we are on track to achieve, and today are affirming out 2013 earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45.  Lynn will provide more details on the first quarter earnings drivers for each of our segments.  Also, she will provide our perspective on the quarterly variability in earnings this year.  ","During the quarter, our operational performance was strong, as highlighted by our nuclear fleet.  Slide five should be familiar to you.  We\u2019ve used it since last summer to show our near term priorities and progress in resolving them.  ","As you can see, we have checked off several important items.  Now we are focused on placing Edwardsport into commercial service and obtaining construction rate case outcomes.  We have requested more than $1 billion of annual retail rate relief in the Carolinas and Ohio.  I will discuss both Edwardsport and the rate cases in a moment.  ","We also remain focused on our longer term priorities.  One, fully integrating the merged companies while achieving the targeted savings for customers and investors, and two, optimizing nuclear fleet performance.","Our integration efforts are producing results, and we\u2019re clearly on track to achieve the merger synergies we expected.  During the first quarter, we had achieved $37 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings from our Carolinas fleet.  That was in addition to the $52 million in the first six months of the merger.","We\u2019re also making good progress on other integration efforts, and are achieving labor reductions and other non-fuel O&M savings.  In fact, about 30% of our merger integration initiatives have been completed.  The other initiatives are either on schedule or ahead of schedule.  ","As for our nuclear plants, [Dhiaa] and his team continue deploying the nuclear operating model across the entire fleet, which includes 11 units in the Carolinas.  We\u2019re seeing very positive results as measured by our 17 nuclear performance metrics.  Most importantly, our nuclear fleet capacity factor for the quarter exceeded 97%.  ","Now, turning to slide six, I want to update you on the regulatory proceedings regarding our Crystal River nuclear unit in Florida.  This plant has been safely shut down since late 2009.  We decided earlier this year to retire the plant rather than attempt a complex, first-of-a-kind repair.  We are finalizing a comprehensive decommissioning plan, and will file it with the NRC.  As you all know, we selected the safe store method.","The transition organization is fully staffed.  Over the next few months, full time staffing will be significantly reduced from the 600 previously on site.  Late last year, we entered into a nonbinding mediation with NEIL, our insurance provider, to resolve all outstanding claims related to the Crystal River 3 unit.","In February, both the company and NEIL accepted the mediators proposal, whereby NEIL would pay the company an additional $530 million to resolve all outstanding insurance claims related to the plant.  We received the $530 million last month, and these proceeds benefit our Florida customers.  We believe that both decisions were in the best overall interest of our customers, joint owners, and investors.","The settlement agreement approved by the Florida Commission last year gave us the sole discretion and flexibility to retire this plant.  The commission is working with the parties and the proceedings to finalize the issues that the commission will review.  We expect the commission to complete this shortly.  Oral arguments before the pre-hearing officer were held earlier this week, and a scheduling order has been issued which sets hearings for October.  ","Before moving to the rate cases, let me give you a brief update on our new nuclear development activities.  Yesterday, we announced our decision to suspend our plan for two proposed new nuclear units at our Harris plant site in North Carolina.  We continue to pursue combined operating and construction licenses for our proposed Lee nuclear station in South Carolina and the Lee nuclear station in Florida.","Related to the Harris license applications, we have spent about $70 million to date.  We plan to seek recovery of the retail allocation of these costs from the North Carolina and South Carolina utility commissions.","Next, starting with slide seven, I will update you on our rate activities in the Carolinas.  Duke Energy Progress filed a general rate case in North Carolina last fall.  We reached a settlement agreement with the North Carolina Public Staff in February.  Under the terms of the settlement, the return on equity would be 10.2%, with a 53% equity component of the cap structure.","The terms are subject to North Carolina commission approval.  Parties to the agreement have agreed to delay cash collection, a financing cost on [quip] for the Sutton natural gas plant for one year.  Upon commission approval, the immediate increase to customers would be $151 million.  There would be another $31 million in year two, upon inclusion of Sutton in customer rates.","This settlement provides a fair and balanced outcome for the commission to consider.  We have completed our hearings before the commission, and expect a decision in time for the new rates to be effective in June.","In addition, Duke Energy Carolinas has filed rate cases in both North Carolina and South Carolina as outlined on slide eight.  We are requesting an annual retail revenue increase of $446 million in North Carolina and $220 million in South Carolina.  In each case, we are seeking a return on equity of 11.25%.  ","These rate cases are needed to recover the investments we have made to modernize our system.  For example, Cliffside Unit 6 and the Dan River natural gas plant, both put into service in late 2012, and both preapproved by the commissions.  ","The evidentiary hearings on the North Carolina case begins July 8, while the Southern California hearing begins July 31.  We expect rates to be effective for South Carolina in September.  We have also requested a September effective date for revised rates in North Carolina.  ","Before moving to the Ohio rate cases, I want to mention a recent decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court.  The court remanded the Duke Energy Carolinas 2012 rate case decision to the North Carolina utilities commission.  As you all will recall, in early 2012 the commission approved revised customer rates based on a settlement agreement with the Public Staff and a 10.5% return on equity.","The North Carolina Attorney General appealed the decision to the State Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has required the commission to make an independent determination regarding the proper ROE.  This past Monday, the Attorney General filed a motion with the commission requesting that the rate increase approved in 2012 be reversed until the commission issues its ROE decision.  We oppose this motion.  We continue to believe that the settlement agreement approved by the commission is fair and balanced.  ","Next, let\u2019s turn to Ohio regulatory activity starting on slide nine, with our two distribution rate cases, one for electric service and the other for natural gas.  Early last month, we reached agreements with all intervening parties in both cases.  Under the settlement terms, the net annualized revenue increase for electric distribution would be $49 million.  There would be no adjustment for natural gas distribution.","Parties to the settlement in the gas case agreed to litigate the recovery of costs associated with the remediation of the old manufactured gas plant sites.  We are seeking annual recovery of $22 million over three years.","The Ohio commission approved the electric case stipulation earlier this week, and we expect revised rates will be in effect later this month.  It will most likely be later in the summer before we receive the gas order.  ","Next, I\u2019ll update you on our Cost-Based Capacity filing in Ohio, as outlined on slide 10.  We filed the $728 million request last August.  We\u2019re seeking appropriate compensation for our capacity service.  This filing does not seek to alter the electric security plan, under which Duke Energy Ohio now operates.  Hearings began in April.  We presented a strong case, and interveners made arguments consistent with their previous filings.  Rebuttal hearings will resume later in May.  ","The legal basis under which this request was filed remains strong.  The filing is consistent with a new cost-based compensation mechanism adopted for fixed resource requirement entities in Ohio.  Once hearings are completed, we will await a commission decision.  The decision will inform our long term strategic plans for our Midwest generation fleet.","Turning to slide 11, we continue to advance our fleet modernization program, $9 billion of investments adding 6,600 megawatts of natural gas and coal-fired generating capacity.  This program gives us the ability to retire up 6,800 megawatts of our older, less efficient, high emitting coal plants and our oil-fired units.  This will give us a high level of fuel diversity, which will benefit customers by giving us flexibility to adapt to future changes in commodity prices.  ","In 2012, we brought three new plants online, a combination of natural gas and coal-fired units, and we\u2019re on track to bring our remaining two construction projects, Edwardsport and Sutton, into service in 2013.  Let me provide you an update on the Edwardsport IGCC coal plant in Indiana.   ","As you all remember, we completed the construction in 2012.  We\u2019re now in the final process of completing the testing needed before we begin to bring the 618 megawatt plant into service and deem it operational.  Both [gas-fires] have successfully produced syngas from coal, and we produce electricity from both turbines using syngas, natural gas, and a blend of both.  ","We\u2019re on track to put Edwardsport into commercial service later this month.  This will be a major milestone.  As with any new large plant, additional testing, completion of punch list items, and project closeout activities will continue for several months past the commercial operating date.  Edwardsport will be a very important addition to our generation fleet in Indiana.","The other major construction project is Sutton, a combined cycle natural gas plant we\u2019re building in eastern North Carolina.  We expect to place the 625 megawatt Sutton plant into commercial service during the fourth quarter.  It represents the latest step in modernizing and adding more natural gas diversification in the Carolinas.","In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, and are focused on resolving near term priorities.  The organization has quickly pulled together as one team.  We continue to drive efficiencies that benefit customers and investors.  We\u2019re making the most of the unique strength this merger has created.  Our performance in the quarter leaves us well-positioned to meet our 2013 earnings and operational objectives.  ","Now, Lynn will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance in the quarter, including a customer load and economic update.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Jim.  I\u2019d like to begin by saying how pleased I am with our first quarter results.  Slide 12 provides our earnings summary.  As you know, first quarter 2013 adjusted diluted earnings were $1.02 per share.  These results were on track with our expectations for the quarter, although lower than our first quarter 2012 results of $1.13 per share.","On a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.89 per share compared to $0.66 per share last year.  A reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials.","Today I will focus my remarks on the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the first quarter.  I\u2019ll spend a few minutes on our volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories.  I will then discuss the timing of several key earnings drivers that you should consider as you assess our quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year.  And I will close with our financial objectives going forward.  ","First, let\u2019s briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments.  Adjusted earnings at our regulated business, U.S. franchise electric and gas, increased by $0.44 per share.  U.S. FE&G\u2019s increased results was primarily driven by the addition of Progress Energy\u2019s regulated utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida, which contributed $0.35 per share in the quarter.","More favorable weather of $0.10 per share was also a significant driver for the quarter.  As you might recall, first quarter 2012 was extremely mild, with the Carolinas heating degree days at their lowest level on record for a first quarter.  Weather during the first quarter of 2013 was favorable to normal by $0.02 per share.  Colder than normal weather in March more than offset the mild weather in January.","During the quarter, pricing and riders were favorable by $0.03 per share.  This increase was primarily due to the timing of revised rates associated with our prior rate cases in the Carolinas.  As a result of these rate cases going into effect in February of 2012, we recognized an additional month of revised rates during this year\u2019s quarter.","Finally, additional wholesale revenues increased earnings by about $0.02 per share for the quarter.  As we discussed at our analyst day in late February, the wholesale business involves the short term and long term contracts to provide power to municipalities and co-ops within our service territories.","We expect the wholesale business will contribute pre-tax net margins of $1 billion in 2013.  This power is sold under various pricing mechanisms such as formula rates and fixed capacity contracts with price escalators.  ","We have several new wholesale contracts that began in 2013.  These contracts will grow over time as the volumes sold increase over the contract term.  The terms of these new contracts are long term, between 15 to 20 years.","As we look forward, we expect our wholesale business to add an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 annually to earnings in 2014 and 2015, resulting in an average growth rate of 8% for this business.","Partially offsetting these favorable drivers for FE&G was a decline and allowance for funds used during construction equity of $0.02 per share resulting from the completion of several major construction projects in 2012 such as Cliffside and Dan River.  As expected, this decline in AFUDC also contributed to a higher effective tax rate.  This higher tax rate decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.  ","Next, I\u2019ll address International Energy\u2019s results, which, as expected, were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter.  International\u2019s results were impacted by lower volumes and higher purchased power costs due to delay and rainfall in Brazil, as well as FX and lower commodity prices at National Methanol.","Let me provide you an update on the rainfall conditions in Brazil.  As we entered 2013, reservoir levels in Brazil were unusually low due to a delay in the rainy season.  Since our analyst day in February, rainfall has been stronger.  This has resulted in reservoir levels increasing from around 30% at the beginning of the year to around 60% currently.  Even though this is a significant improvement, these levels are still below historic averages for this time of year.","Due to the lower reservoir levels, higher cost thermal power is being allocated to cover the demand, resulting in a higher exposure to cost for hydro-generators, including our Brazilian operations.  We will continue to monitor the reservoir levels and keep you updated as the year progresses.","Next, moving to our commercial power segment, results were $0.03 lower in the first quarter as compared to the prior year.  This decline was primarily due to lower PJM capacity revenues for our Midwest generation fleet.  Prices declined from $110 per megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 per megawatt day in the first quarter of 2013.","And finally, let me discuss other.  This category primarily includes corporate interest expense not allocated to the business units, results from Duke Energy\u2019s captive insurance company, other investments, and quarterly income tax levelization adjustments.","We recorded higher interest expense of $0.04 associated with the Progress Energy holding company debt and $0.02 per share associated with higher debt levels at Duke Energy holding company.  We also recognized dilution of $0.41 per share for the quarter, resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the Progress merger.  As you know, we issued around 258 million shares after the completion of the merger.  We now have around 705 million shares outstanding.","Turning to slide 13, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories.  As a reminder, it\u2019s important to note that 2012 was a leap year.","Our 2013 guidance assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of around 0.5%.  For the first quarter, our retail volumes, excluding the impacts of weather, were down 0.5% to the prior period across all customer classes.  However, if the prior year leap year effect is excluded, our first quarter volumes would have been favorable by approximately 0.5%, which is consistent with our annual expectations.","Let me briefly discuss some of the trends we are seeing in each of our customer classes.  First, our residential customers.  Usage per customer for this class continues to trend slightly lower.  We continue to experience growth in the average number of customers, primarily in the Carolinas, Indiana, and Florida.  Since last year, we\u2019ve added approximately 50,000 new electric customers, an average increase of 0.7%.  Trends in this customer class will continue to track the recovery in the housing markets as well as the general economy.  ","Excluding the leap year effect, our commercial class remains on a slow and steady growth path.  Usage per customer in this sector is relatively flat, while growth in consumer spending and retail sales remain modest.  Office vacancy rates remain consistent, and above historical norms.","In the industrial sector in the Carolinas, we continue to experience strength in the automotive sector, which has helped to offset the continued decline in the textile industry.  In the Midwest, the automotive sector is also strong, but has been offset by recent weakness in the steel industry due to volatile steel prices and global economic uncertainties.  As you will recall, industrial activity comprises a very small percentage of our customer load in Florida.  ","Overall, the economy continues to perform in line with our expectations and is recovering at a slow and steady pace.  We expect economic activity to pick up in the second half of the year.  Our service territories remain attractive for economic development activities.  ","As an example, MetLife, the global life insurance and employee benefits provider, announced in March that it intends to create 2,600 jobs in Charlotte and Cary, North Carolina by the end of 2015.  And just a few weeks ago, Google announced it is expanding its data center site in western North Carolina, making an additional $600 million investment to the area.  These announcements have resulted in new investments and jobs in our service territories.  ","Now I\u2019d like to discuss several earnings considerations for this year.  As you are aware, the midpoint of our 2013 earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45 is reasonably consistent with our adjusted EPS of $4.32 in 2012.  Even though the annual earnings per share are expected to be reasonably consistent, the quarterly contributions in 2013 will differ from 2012.  We expect a relatively weaker first half in 2013 compared to 2012 and a relatively stronger second half.","This variability is being driven by a few key drivers, which are outlined on slide 14.  First, the timing of rate case resolutions.  We expect to begin recognizing the benefits from our pending rate cases in the third and fourth quarters upon approval from our commission.  ","Our second key driver is the timing of recognizing O&M expenses and merger savings.  We expect to experience more significant merger synergies in the back half of the year as these savings ramp up over time.","Third, the impact of the issuance of incremental shares in connection with the Progress Energy merger.  As I mentioned a moment ago, we will have significantly higher share counts in the first half of 2013 compared to 2012.  Even though the additional share counts are evenly distributed throughout the year, the offsetting earnings contributions from the Progress utilities are not.  The first half of the year normally contributes lower earnings than the second half due to seasonality.","The fourth key driver is significantly lower PJM capacity revenues for our non-regulated Midwest generation fleet.  As I previously mentioned, in the June 2012 to May 2013 PJM auctions, the capacity price declined sharply to $16 per megawatt day from the previous price of $110 per megawatt day.","Overall, our first quarter results are on track with our plan and give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year 2013 EPS guidance range.  In closing, we are affirming the guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45 for 2013 based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Results for the full year will be largely department on the successful resolution of our pending major rate requests, effective cost controls, and our results in the third quarter, historically our most significant.  ","We continue to focus on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition.  We are committed to a payout ratio of 65% of 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Our current dividend yield of 4.1% remains attractive in the ongoing low interest rate environment, and we remain confident we are on track to achieve our short term and long term financial objectives.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim.","Jim Rogers","Thanks, Lynn.  With that, let\u2019s open up the phone lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  We\u2019ll take our first question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.  ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Can you give us an update of where you stand in terms of your CEO search, and whether you can give us any view on whether we get visibility on that at the front end of the period that\u2019s stipulated in the settlement, or towards the end of the year?","Jim Rogers ","The CEO selection process is being led by a special committee of the board.  The committee is working with an outside advisor to support this process in applying a great deal of rigor and due diligence.  Of all the decisions a board can make, the most important decision is the selection of the CEO.  ","They are looking at both internal candidates as well as external candidates.  The process is ongoing.  They are being very thoughtful, deliberative, and are working their way through this.  And it\u2019s difficult at this time to predict whether a decision will actually be made.  But in every event, it will be made before the end of this year.   ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group ","It\u2019s been fairly often the case that you\u2019ve been able to settle cases in North Carolina.  I can\u2019t remember a situation where the ROE has been challenged in court and remanded in this fashion.  Is there any precedent for this type of scenario, and can we look at that precedent, if there is any, into how the commission might respond?","Jim Rogers ","As a general rule, the Supreme Court defers to the judgment of the state commission.  I think what\u2019s important to appreciate about the remand to the state commission is this: They didn\u2019t strike down the 10.5% ROE.  What they simply did was ask the commission to explain in detail the basis of their approval of the settlement and specifically the underlying basis for the 10.5%.  There\u2019s ample evidence in the record, and what is expected from the commission, and at least what we expect from the commission, is that they will review the evidence that was presented, and they will write an order that underpins the 10.5%.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Just following up on Greg\u2019s question on the North Carolina situation.  Does that potentially have any bearing on how the progress settlement is put together when it gets presented ultimately to the commission?  Or does it prospectively slow down the Duke case in the sense of maybe you need to build a bigger, more broad docket in order to avoid a debate in the future?","Jim Rogers ","Good question.  I would address it this way.  When we file for a rate case, we file with a lot of testimony that really supports the ROE request that we\u2019re making.  As a consequence of that, when we enter into a settlement, as we have in the Progress Energy case, basically that 10.2% is underpinned with testimony and we will file additional testimony when there\u2019s a hearing on the settlement.  ","So I think the most important point here is that one doesn\u2019t change the historic practice in the Carolinas of reaching settlements and presenting settlements to the commission.  What the court has really done is ask the commission to explain in much greater detail why they approved the settlement, and specifically why they approved the ROE.  So I think it\u2019s really a message to the commission to address, based on record evidence, why they made their decision in more detail.  ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","On the Ohio capacity case situation, obviously the other parties have pretty staunchly maintained their position, and you guys have maintained yours.  Is there an opportunity for you guys to look at a settlement or find a common ground on this issue, or is this one that\u2019s going to have to go to a commission decision and prospectively litigation to get to a fair outcome, from your perspective?","Jim Rogers ","You know, Dan, my judgment is we\u2019ve always reached settlements in Ohio, but this one is difficult if not impossible to reach a settlement.  I don\u2019t rule out the possibility of a settlement later in the process, but I think it\u2019s where everybody\u2019s kind of strapped on their position and going full speed before the commission to make the argument.  ","The argument is a strong argument, and if I put my\u2014I haven\u2019t practiced law in a long time\u2014but if I put my hat on as a lawyer, this case is a very strong case for us, because this capacity charge has been approved for AEP and the consequence of it, the commission can\u2019t discriminate against one company versus another company in the application of their rulings.  And so we\u2019re clearly going to win in the Supreme Court.  I believe we can win, and there seems to be evidence, or an indication, that we could win at the commission.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","And then Lynn, just one question on commercial power.  You know, after the first quarter was kind of off the full year rate and capacity\u2019s going to work [unintelligible] in the second half, what should we be thinking about this?  Kind of help fill in against guidance where you guys have it today.","Lynn Good","Dan, we do have an assumption of some success in Ohio in our guidance, and I think as we shared with you in February, you should look at the broad guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45.  We\u2019ve assumed a range of outcomes.  And so as we move through this process and get some more clarity on Ohio, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you more sense of how commercial will contribute, as well as how the other parts of the business will contribute.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.  ","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to touch on your disclosure on wholesale revenues and Lynn, you provided some discussion of that business.  Can you talk a bit to execution risk relating to that and the certainty of being able to achieve that.  It looks like good EPS contribution, 8% growth.  Can you just talk a little bit about where you stand?  You mentioned a few contracts, but I couldn\u2019t kind of relate that back to the overall number.","Lynn Good","We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and that growth rate, because the contracts have been signed and are in place.  So the two that we pointed two was a wrapped contract or an extended contract with NCEMC in the eastern part of our Carolina territory, and then a contract that we announced really back in 2010 involving co-ops in the northern part of South Carolina, a contract that will ramp up over a period of time, over the next several years.  So the contracts are in place, and we believe that we have a high degree of confidence in achieving those numbers.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley ","And then just on the financial side of things, your interest expense year to date and your overall assumptions, just curious, as you are looking at your financing plan relative to where you initially set your assumptions, are things generally tracking online, or are rates coming in lower?  How are you sort of tracking in terms of your financing costs?","Lynn Good","Generally tracking online, and we have, in the appendix, our expectation for additional financing over the course of the year.  We do have a number of issuances that we\u2019ll plan in the back half of the year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.  ","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","A quick on on Brazil.  What would be a good assumption for a run rate headwind if the current curtailments continue through the year?  We\u2019ve heard some talk that they might want to really build a buffer ahead of the World Cup next year, etc.  So if things don\u2019t improve, is Q1 a guide to future quarters?","Lynn Good","That\u2019s a good question.  As we looked at planning for Brazil and for international, what was delivered this first quarter was actually consistent with our plan.  So we were expecting this level of contribution.  We do see some expectation of higher than average dispatch on thermal generation for the balance of 2013, but we would not expect it to have the impact that it had in the first quarter.  But what I would also say is this is a situation that we\u2019re continuing to monitor, and we\u2019ll give you an update as the year progresses.  ","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","And on another front, can you give us a little more insight into what\u2019s still showing up in the cost to achieve line.  And what kind of timeframe should we expect that to fade?","Lynn Good","Cost to achieve will be with us for a few years, primarily related to integration of systems, and also costs, if we continue to move through the exiting of employees who are leaving under the voluntary severance plan.  So a couple of examples would be HR and finance systems will not be in effect until early \u201914.  Nuclear asset suite, where we\u2019re combining systems in the nuclear operation and work management systems, those projects will continue into \u201914, \u201915, and \u201916.  So they will tail off over time, but we will continue to have cost to achieve for a couple of years.   ","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","And this sort of Q1 level is probably where we are for the next year or two?","Lynn Good","I haven\u2019t looked at it from a run rate perspective.  So let us take that one, Jonathan, and the IR team will be prepared to respond and give you some more input on that.  ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Can you talk a little bit about Crystal River, and specifically decommissioning costs and the decommissioning fund, meaning what are the variables that could significantly change the expected decommissioning cost of the plans, where does the fund stand in terms of meeting the decommissioning cost for the plant, and how do you manage the risk around the cost variability of decommissioning, meaning are there ways you can shelter Duke from cost escalation in the decommissioning of Crystal River over time?","Lynn Good","I\u2019ll start and see if we can resolve\u2026 Dhiaa\u2019s also here for further discussion on the specifics of the decommissioning plan.  But we have $600 million in the decommissioning trust fund, which is a fully funded level, assuming that the plant retires in the 2030 timeframe.  Under the safe store method that we\u2019ve adopted, we have 40 to 50 years to move through decommissioning of this plant.  ","And so we believe our funding level is adequate.  We\u2019ll be monitoring it as we go, and you ought to think about it as almost equivalent to the way we manage liabilities in a pension fund, where we have investments, with equity and fixed income that we match to an expectation of liabilities.  And we run scenarios and assumptions on cost as well as scenarios and assumptions on investment of assets to ensure that we\u2019re adequately funded.  ","Dhiaa Jamil","From a plant point of view, there is a process that we will follow to produce a cost estimate for decommissioning.  We have to file with the NRC a report that is called the \u201cPost-Shutdown Decommissioning Activity Report\u201d and have to outline in that report our estimates, a site-specific cost estimate.  We are due to submit that in November of this year, and 90 days after that, that is considered approval of that report.  We\u2019ll be able to give you significantly more details about the scope of that work.  ","Primarily, systems have already been drained down because the plant has been shut down for quite a while.  So we\u2019re a good bit ahead on those activities.  Basically we\u2019ll just stop maintenance on those systems, other than those that are associated with the spent fuel and related support systems.  That will dictate the vast majority of the plan going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs ","What are the biggest cost buckets, or cost areas, in terms of decommissioning a nuclear facility like CR3?  I\u2019m just trying to think about some of the variable, very big picture, broad brush, that could change your forecast decommissioning costs higher or lower when you put out that report in November.","Dhiaa Jamil","It is entirely based on dismantling all equipment at the plant, and then dealing with the spent fuel pool contents.  Currently, CR3 does not have dry storage, so that\u2019s a pretty significant consideration, of how do we move forward with the fuel that\u2019s in the pool.  Other than that, it\u2019s really just dismantling the equipment and the manner we go about doing that.  Those are the two main variables.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.  ","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","In the context of past success, I think you guys have beaten consensus quarters for three or four years in a row, every quarter, and didn\u2019t do it this time.  Did you hit your internal numbers and just consensus was too high?  Or did you not hit your internal numbers?","Lynn Good","We\u2019re on plan, internal numbers, so we did hit plan.  And what we were trying to demonstrate with slide 14 is sort of the quarterly variability that you can expect as you look at comparables between \u201912 and \u201913.  So we have a high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to finish the year consistent with our expectations.  So that\u2019s where we are.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","And then a follow up on the wholesale sales and the slide.  The $0.07 to $0.08 is both in \u201914 and then incrementally in \u201915?","Lynn Good","It is.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","And is that matching up with rate-based growth in wholesale as well?  So when you have wholesale on the slide, is it matching there?  Or is it more just tied to contracted price increases?","Lynn Good","It\u2019s load.  You can think of it as additional load, where we are bringing on additional megawatts of load in those years.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","And is there any offset in retail, i.e. less retail sales, or less wholesale full retail benefit?","Lynn Good","No.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.  ","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","My question is on page 19, 2013 earnings guidance assumptions.  I\u2019m looking at commercial power and the assumption of $95 million of earnings in 2013 relative to the $6 million earned in the first quarter.  And I think that reflects the expectation of an award of capacity revenues by the PUCO, if I\u2019m not incorrect.  What should we expect regarding the underlying earnings power of that fleet in the absence of an award of capacity revenues this year?  Will it resemble what we saw in the first quarter, the expected material improvement in the subsequent three quarters?  ","Lynn Good","The other major driver in that segment is capacity prices.  So $16 through May of this year.  It will go up to $28 in the back half.  And then you have energy for the coal and gas fleet, and we\u2019ve seen trends comparable to others in the Midwest.  We\u2019re seeing a little bit more coal generation, a little les gas generation, as prices have risen.  So those are the other drivers to think about.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein ","And on 23, you provide an analysis of your weather-normalized generation, or power sales, over the last 12 months, and on the right hand column, you can see it\u2019s been broadly flat.  Is this a trend you expect to continue?  Or are there reasons to believe that the last 12 months were somehow different from what we\u2019ll see in the year, two years ahead?","Lynn Good","If you look back at rolling 12 months to the end of 12, we were at 0.6%.  If we were to do leap year adjustment on this rolling 12 months, it would be 0.3% overall growth, and we\u2019re projecting 0.5%.  So we feel like we\u2019re reasonably consistent or in the range with our expectations.  We think they\u2019re cautious, and as we have done every quarter, we\u2019ll just continue to update you on developments that we see.  We\u2019re seeing strength in customer growth, we\u2019re seeing some strength in automotive in our industrial segment, and then some weaknesses in primary metals that I referenced a moment ago.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.  ","Julian Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Following a little bit up on the North Carolina situation, I wanted to get a little bit more clarity here, because there\u2019s just so many different pending filings, including the Supreme Court remand regarding ROE.  I\u2019d be curious, is there any potential for all of these ROEs to kind of be resolved at once, shall we say?  Obviously there\u2019s a certain timeline here which the NCU needs to address the remand, but they have other rate cases in front of them.  ","Is there any ability to kind of deal with it at once, or would your expectation be we\u2019ll get an updated ROE for a certain period of time and then we\u2019ll have a new ROE effective whenever the subsequent case comes into effect?  Just trying to get a sense of the ability to interject new testimony into the ROE, and secondly the timeline.  ","Jim Rogers ","My judgment is that there\u2019s adequate testimony underpinning the 10.5% ROE in the Duke Energy case that was remanded back.  I think what the commission will do, particularly in light of the motion by the attorney general, they\u2019re probably all right going to work to write an order that really underpins the 10.5%.  So I think they\u2019ll do it seriatum, and that will be first.  ","I think the second thing that they will focus on is the settlement of PEC, with a 10.2, and that order will probably come on the heels of that.  And then subsequently, with the new Duke Energy case, that will probably be working on resolving that through settlement over the coming weeks and months, and that will be third in line.  That will be my view of how that unfolds.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith - UBS ","And each will continue to have a discretely separate process for setting that ROE?","Jim Rogers ","I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the way it will work.  Because it makes sense, and it\u2019s consistent with the traditional practice and procedure of the commission.  ","Julian Dumoulin-Smith - UBS ","Going back to the international business for a second here, obviously there have been some acquisitions.  Chile, there\u2019s been some commentary around Peru.  What is the thought process, as we sit here today, around expanding the business given the cash balance?  Is this a year for more expansive deployment of that balance?","Lynn Good","We continue to look for opportunities to grow the business that are consistent with our return expectations.  The countries we like, generation is kind of the part of the system we\u2019re interested in.  And I would say our aspirations this year are no different than they are any year.  If we find an asset that fits with us and meets return expectations, we would pursue it.  And we have been systematically, over the last five years, adding, in a moderate way, assets that are complementary to our portfolio.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith - UBS ","Any particular market as it stands today that you\u2019re focused on?","Lynn Good","Well, we were focused on Chile in \u201912.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Bischof with Morningstar.  ","Andy Bischof - Morningstar","I was wondering if you could just comment on the level of switching from gas back to coal in your generation portfolio.  A couple of your peers have posted pretty dramatic shifts in their generation mix compared to 2012.","Lynn Good","What I would say is in our Midwestern fleet we\u2019ve seen an increase in coal generation and a decrease in gas generation really consistent with the fact that those coal assets are positioned very favorably for transport.  In the Carolinas, we haven\u2019t seen what I would call switching, but we have seen higher capacity factors of our coal plants, in our Duke Carolinas territory.  Transportation, as you know, in the Carolinas, is a bit more expensive, and the price at which gas is advantaged to coal is a bit higher.","Andy Bischof - Morningstar ","And what is that price in the Carolinas?","Lynn Good","I would say probably $4.50ish?  ","Jim Rogers ","And I think that\u2019s the price, Lynn, that once gas gets to $4.50, then we turn on the Cliffside plant, because it\u2019s our most efficient coal plant.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.  ","Ali Agha - SunTrust","I wanted to get a little more insight.  On one of your slides, you talk about an EPS growth of 4% to 6%.  That\u2019s the aspiration from \u201913 through \u201915.  And you look at your commercial power unit, a cyclically low point here because of the capacity payments.  International, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that the hydro situation is hurting you right now.  We have that wholesale growth coming up next couple of years.  Cost reductions [unintelligible].  I\u2019m just curious, I would have thought the growth rate would be somewhat higher given the cyclically low \u201913 that we\u2019re looking at.  Can you give me a little more insight into how we keep it in that 4% to 6% range?","Lynn Good","You know, Ali, we\u2019re smiling at the question, because I think our questions have primarily been, \u201cHow could you possibly get to the high end of the range?\u201d  And you\u2019re arguing why aren\u2019t we higher, which we\u2019re delighted to hear.","You know, the 4% to 6% we think is a reasonable expectation.  You\u2019ve talked about commercial certainly contributing to that.  And then we look at franchise electric and gas with the key drivers being rate base, our merger synergies, the continued focus on driving cost out of the business.  ","So we have a high degree of confidence of hitting the 4% to 6% range, and as we see these fundamental pieces coming into place in \u201913 with rate cases and other things, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a better sense of what \u201914 and \u201915 could look like as the year progresses.  ","Ali Agha - SunTrust ","I understand, the largest, the regulated business dominates the percentage growth going back.  Second question, on Ohio, just to be clear, Jim, on the strategic plan there, you had gone down the path of looking to potentially exit the [merchant] generation business.  Then the capacity case obviously came up, and you want to play that out.  Once that decision comes out, whether you get it or not, regardless, but once that decision is out, strategically, does that merchant portfolio still fit with Duke, or will it still make sense to focus more on the regulated and get out of that volatile business?","Jim Rogers ","That\u2019s a good question.  I think we\u2019re going to wait and see what the decision is from the Ohio commission, and then we\u2019re going to make a decision with respect to those assets.  I think it would be premature for me to comment on what we would do, but we believe we\u2019re entitled to this capacity payment and if we don\u2019t get it, I think we\u2019ll have to make a tough decision about those assets going forward.  But more to come on that.  Our focus is on creating value and reducing the risk of our portfolio, and so we\u2019ll make a decision consistent with that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust ","Just to be clear on your thinking, if you do get the capacity payment, that does not necessarily mean that you\u2019re going to still own those.  You could still go down the divestiture path?","Lynn Good","You know, Ali, I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see the conditions of the order from the commission.  So at this point, we are under order to move the assets out of the utility to an affiliate by the end of 2014, and I think we\u2019ll just await any clarity the commission would provide on that as part of the cost base capacity order.","Jim Rogers ","I think the other dynamic that plays into this is also the movement in gas prices.  This time last year, gas was about $1.87 in MMBTU.  It average $3.48 in MMBTU last year, and now we\u2019re in the $4.40 range.  And some people are predicting we\u2019ll be to $5 to $5.50 before year-end in gas prices.  So that will have a significant impact on the value of the coal plants in the Midwest, as well as the gas plants as we look forward.","Operator","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Currens for any additional or closing remarks.   ","Jim Rogers ","This is Jim Rogers stepping in for Bill.  I want to thank you all again for your interest and your investment in Duke Energy.  We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2013.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Currens","Thank you, Sandy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Group Executive and Chief Financial Officer. Jim and Lynn will review our first quarter results and provide an update on key issues. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.

Rogers","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Today, we will review our quarterly earnings results, provide an update on economic activity and customer load growth trends, as well as summarize what we are experiencing with coal-to-gas switching. We will also review the status of our combination with Progress Energy and discuss the settlement agreement we announced earlier this week with respect to the Edwardsport project in Indiana. This settlement agreement resolves uncertainty regarding the cost recovery of this important investment. I will review the terms of this settlement later in my remarks, but let me begin with an overview of the quarter. ","Today, we announced first quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38. That compares to $0.39 in the first quarter of 2011. Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.22 as compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Current quarter reported results reflect $0.20 of charges related to the settlement agreement on the Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana. This charge has been treated as a special item for the quarter. Consequently, it has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share. ","The quarter was characterized by unusually mild weather across all of our service territories. In fact, this past winter was the fourth warmest winter season on record for the entire U.S. I am pleased with our employees' efforts to effectively manage costs during the quarter. This helped offset some of the impact from the weather. We also benefited from increases in customer prices in the Carolinas as a result of our rate case request last year. ","In our commercial businesses, international operations continue to deliver strong results, mitigating the reduced earnings we expected from our new ESP agreement in Ohio. In addition to cost control, our operational performance during the quarter was impressive. The regulated nuclear fleet delivered a capacity factor of 99.7%. Meanwhile, our nonregulated gas fleet in the Midwest continued to operate at record-generating levels, benefiting from low gas prices. ","I am pleased with where we stand at the end of the first quarter. While we cannot control the weather, I commend our employees for focusing on what we can control, specifically our fleet and grid performance, as well as our expenses. Based upon our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guided range of $1.40 to $1.45. ","Now I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.","Lynn J. Good","Thank you, Jim. Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment EBIT basis. As a result, earnings for each segment include interest and income tax expense. In addition, corporate governance costs, which were previously reflected in the category labeled other, are now allocated to each segment. ","First, let's review earnings for our regulated utilities, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Quarterly adjusted segment income was relatively flat with the prior year quarter. Revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower operation and maintenance expense helped to offset the impact of unfavorable weather. ","Let me give you some perspective on the mild weather, which affected earnings per share by about $0.04. In the Carolinas, we had the lowest level of heating degree days on record for the first quarter. Heating degree days were below normal by around 25% in the Carolinas and 28% in the Midwest. We were able to offset about $0.01 per share of the weather impact with reductions in our O&M costs during the quarter. Due to the unfavorable weather and the low natural gas price environment, we are generating fewer megawatt hours from our coal plants. ","We've examined our operations for opportunities to reduce cost. From a labor perspective, we have displaced contractors, reduced overtime and have not filled open positions. Additionally, we will defer certain scheduled outages since the plants are not running at the levels we originally anticipated. Assuming normal weather and storm activity, we expect our 2012 O&M to be down about 2% from 2011 as a result of the actions identified in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on costs while also ensuring the continued safety of our employees and reliability of our systems. ","Also during the quarter, FE&G began to realize the benefit of recent rate case outcomes in both North and South Carolina, which increased earnings per share by about $0.03. These revised rates primarily reflect recovery of investments in our fleet modernization program. ","Now let me move on to Duke Energy International, which continued to provide strong financial results. This segment's adjusted income increased principally due to higher volumes and pricing in Brazil, as well as at NMC, more than offsetting the impact of the prior year favorable arbitration award in Peru. ","Finally, I'll briefly discuss the results for our nonregulated Commercial Power segment. As expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment income was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of the new Electric Security Plan in Ohio. That plan resulted in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.02. As you'll recall, under our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation dispatches into PJM. That generation receives an energy margin, as well as capacity revenues based upon PJM clearing prices. Duke Energy Ohio is also collecting an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge through the end of 2014, adding $0.01 to the first quarter results. ","Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleet continued its strong performance, contributing around $0.01 more than in the first quarter of 2011. The gas fleet's earnings were supported by higher volumes and margins resulting from low gas prices. Our Midwest gas fleet dispatched about 1,900 gigawatt hours more than the prior year quarter, nearly a 70% increase. As expected, PJM capacity revenue received by the Midwest gas fleet was lower in first quarter 2012 as the capacity price fell from the $174 per megawatt day in the prior year to $110 per megawatt day. ","As a result of the reset of our ESP in Ohio to market-based rates, volumes and margins realized by our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, were lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduced earnings by around $0.01 per share. Despite a challenging environment, the Commercial Power team continues to work to control costs and optimize the performance of the nonregulated generating fleet. ","Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. This slide presents our quarterly volume trends by customer class based on calculations that exclude weather impact. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance assumes we'll experience weather-normalized volume increases of about 0.7%, driven by expected growth of approximately 1% in both the industrial and commercial customer classes. ","On a weather-normal basis, quarterly volumes were around 1% higher than the prior year period. However, most of this favorable trend was due to an extra day in first quarter 2012 resulting from leap year. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which remains strong across both the Carolinas and Midwest. Weather-normalized industrial volumes were 2.6% higher than the prior year quarter. Growth persists across several major industrial classes, specifically the automotive, chemical and heavy-equipment sectors. However, weakness continues in housing-related sectors and among our textile customers in the Carolinas. ","Economic development activities continue to remain strong in our service territories, bringing new investments and jobs. For example, tire manufacturer Michelin announced last month that it will invest $750 million for a new plant and a factory expansion in South Carolina, that combined are expected to create 500 new jobs. ","Let me move on to trends in the residential customer class. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were essentially flat, an increase of about 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. We are seeing positive trends in the number of residential customers being added in the Carolinas and Midwest. We've added approximately 20,000 more electric and gas customers from the prior year quarter, an average growth of around 0.5%. Even though this level of growth is below what we were experiencing before the recession, it is significantly higher than the 5,000 customers we added at the same time last year. We continue, however, to experience a reduction in our residential customers' average kilowatt hour usage. A sluggish economic recovery, high gasoline prices and energy efficiency initiatives may all be influencing these usage patterns. ","Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.6% higher than the prior year. This customer class continues to be weighed down by high office and retail vacancy rates and low construction activity.","The economy within our service territories maintains its slow recovery. Industrial activity remained strong, yet consumers continue to be cautious. Unemployment rates have improved but remain at historically high levels. Further, last week's announcement of first quarter U.S. GDP showed a slowing from the fourth quarter of last year. All of these factors leave us cautious and guardedly optimistic on the overall economic recovery. ","As we forecast the remainder of the year, we are seeing some challenges in our ability to achieve the 0.7% weather-normal volume growth assumed in our 2012 guidance. We will continue to monitor customer volume trends as we progress throughout the year. ","Finally, let me discuss the issue of coal-to-gas switching, which is resulting from the low natural gas price environment. The charts on Slide 8 show our generation fuel mix over the last 2 years and our current projection for 2012, both in the regulated businesses and in our nonregulated Midwest generation business. As demonstrated by these charts, the commodity price environment has significantly changed the mix of generation, resulting in less coal and more natural gas. For example, in the Carolinas, our Buck combined cycle gas plant, which became operational this past November, has been dispatching like a baseload generating unit. In fact, it is currently dispatching just after our nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. ","Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, our nonregulated Midwest gas-fired generation continues to run at high levels. In fact, 2011 was the third straight year this fleet achieved record generation levels. And if low gas prices persist, 2012 is looking like another record year.","As a result of reduced coal burns expected in 2012 from mild weather and low natural gas prices, our coal inventory levels have increased. Inventory levels are currently above our target of about 40 days in the Carolinas and about 45 days in Indiana. In 2009, the impacts of the economic recession put us in a similar situation, but we were able to work with our coal suppliers to effectively manage inventory levels. We are doing the same this year. ","We've had extensive discussions with our coal suppliers, and we're evaluating contract deferrals or buyouts, as well as additional coal storage options, both on and off-site. In February, we implemented a coal price decrement in Indiana, increasing the dispatch of our coal units. To the extent the units are dispatched, coal coming to the stations is consumed and other higher potential costs are avoided. Overall, customers benefit. We'll continue to monitor this situation and take appropriate action as needed. ","In summary, for the remainder of the year, we'll continue to monitor customer load growth trends, and our focus on effective cost control and operational performance to help drive our financial results. We remain on track to achieve $1.40 to $1.45 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2012. However, actual results for the year will be largely dependent upon the third quarter, historically our most significant. Additionally, we remain well positioned to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% long-term growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. ","Now I'll turn it back over to Jim.","James E. Rogers","Thanks, Lynn. Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation plan. The filing features both interim and permanent mitigation components. ","The permanent mitigation solution involves the building and upgrading of transmission and an estimated cost of about $110 million. The transmission projects are designed to significantly increase power import capabilities and enhance competitive power supply options in the Progress and Duke Carolinas service territories. ","The proposal also features a 2- to 3-year interim mitigation plan with firm power purchase agreements already signed with 3 third parties. The agreements will be in place from the date the merger closes until the transmission projects are operational, at which time the interim mitigation will terminate. The costs of this interim mitigation, which we're able to currently estimate, are included on this slide. ","Our regulatory and legal teams have spent considerable effort investigating solutions to address FERC's concerns about market power in the Carolinas. FERC's common period on our mitigation plan ended last week, and we responded to intervenor comments earlier this week. We believe that our revised mitigation plan addresses the FERC's concerns and that the protests to the plan are without merit. We've requested that FERC issue orders approving the mitigation plan, the joint dispatch agreement and the joint open access transmission tariff no later than June 8. After satisfactory FERC approval, we will continue to seek final merger-related approvals from the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions. ","Over the past several weeks, we have had constructive discussions with the North Carolina public staff. These discussions have centered on how the cost of the proposed FERC mitigation plan will be handled for rate-making purposes, as well as some clarifications, including the timing on the $650 million guarantee of fuel and joint dispatch savings. We hope to have a revised settlement in place soon that balances the interests of consumers and shareholders. ","We have restarted our integration planning on a limited basis, focusing on those areas that are critical to day 1 operations of a combined Duke Progress. We will continue to keep you informed on developments regarding the merger in the weeks ahead. ","Next, let me review the Edwardsport settlement, an important milestone in achieving clarity on the cost recovery of this investment. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana related to recovery of construction costs for the project. This settlement is subject to the approval of the Indiana commission.","Let me highlight a few provisions of the agreement. First, the settlement includes a cap of construction costs, including financing costs, to be reflected in customer rates of approximately $2.59 billion as of June 30. This amount includes approximately $2.32 billion of estimated direct costs, as well as estimated financing costs. To the extent we do not have a final commission order by June 30, Duke Energy Indiana will be able to recover additional financing costs until customer rates are revised. ","Second, Duke Energy Indiana will not request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with the rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014. ","And finally, Duke Energy Indiana will incur approximately $20 million to reimburse to settling parties for attorney fees and litigation expenses, as well as make other funding commitments for low-income heating assistance in Indiana. The agreement also includes certain measures which help mitigate the customer rate impact of the project. For example, we agreed to implement revised depreciation rates to the benefit of customers. ","Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customer rate impacts of this project are to be implemented as follows: first, recovery of project financing costs up to the hard cap amounts will be reflected in customer rates as soon as practical, upon commission approval, and will result in an average increase in customer rates of 3.2%; and second, recovery of posted service costs such as O&M costs and depreciation is estimated to start mid-2013 based on our rider request to be filed after the expected in-service date of the plan, will result in the average increase in customer rates of 6.4%. Until such recovery is obtained, these posted service costs will be deferred following the in-service date of the project. ","Provisions of the settlement agreement resulted in an approximate $420 million pretax charge or roughly a $0.20 EPS impact in the first quarter 2012. This impairment reduces the annual earnings contribution from this project by approximately $0.02 on an ongoing basis. I am pleased that the parties were able to reach this agreement. ","The agreement is balanced and reasonable and achieves 2 important objectives: first, it mitigates the cost impact of this project to our Indiana customers; and second, it resolves the regulatory uncertainty regarding construction cost recovery. We have requested the commission to establish a procedural schedule to address the settlement and expect a final commission decision at the summer or fall of this year. ","Our current focus is on bringing the Edwardsport facility to full operation later this year, allowing us to provide Indiana customers with cleaner power to meet increasingly strict federal environmental regulations, as well as utilize a readily available local resource, Indiana coal. ","Let me discuss the status of the Edwardsport construction project and our Carolina projects outlined on Slide 11. Construction of the Edwardsport IGCC project is essentially finished and the start-up phase is well underway. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines successfully completed in March. Edwardsport is on schedule to go online this fall. ","Cliffside is 97% complete with construction. Commissioning, start-up and testing of plant equipment are currently underway. The plant's first fire on coal remains targeted for later in the second quarter. We plan to bring the plant online this fall on time and on budget. ","The 620-megawatt combined cycle Dan River gas plant is also on time and on budget, with construction 85% complete and commercial operations scheduled for the fourth quarter. ","Finally, let me give you an update on our growing renewables business. Last week, we closed on a 50-50 joint venture partnership with Sumitomo for 2 large-scale wind farms that Duke Energy Renewables is building in Kansas: the 131-megawatt Cimarron II project and the 168-megawatt Ironwood project. Both projects are scheduled to go online later this year. In addition, we have 3 other wind projects currently under construction. ","We also continue to grow our renewable solar business, targeting the addition of around 25 to 50 megawatts in new capacity this year. By the end of 2012, our total owned renewable capacity is expected to grow to almost 1,700 megawatts, an increase of about 60% since the end of last year. ","In closing, let me say I am very pleased with where we stand through the first quarter of 2012. We remain on track with our earnings objectives and have entered into constructive agreement on our Edwardsport project in Indiana. ","Slide 12 summarizes the key short-term and long-term priorities we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. For the rest of the year, we remain focused on our primary strategic objectives: first, obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals related to our merger with Progress; second, completing the remaining major construction projects; third, obtaining reasonable regulatory outcomes in the Edwardsport proceeding and our upcoming rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio, which we will likely file with regulators around mid-year; and finally, achieving our earnings guidance range for the year. ","Our employees' hard work continues to support Duke Energy's ongoing mission of delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy, benefiting our customers, investors and the communities we serve. ","Now let's open up the phone lines for you all's questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, first, on the merger, I just noticed that you mentioned that you've restarted the integration process. So I guess my question is, does that mean it stopped? And when was that? And what changed? And can you just provide some color on what you're referring to?","James E. Rogers","Sure. Let me ask Lynn to address that question, if I may.","Lynn J. Good","Jonathan, at the time we received the FERC order in December, we really put pencils down a bit, finishing up what was going to be required for legal day 1 but really putting it on the shelf so that we could get focused on running Duke and Progress separately at the beginning of the year. We didn't have specific clarity on timing of the FERC filing and closing, et cetera. So we've been focused first few months of the year on the things you would expect us to be focused on, running the business well. And now we believe we're getting to the point where we should start brushing off the legal day 1 work and restarting integration so that we're prepared for a July 1 closing.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the coal piles, could I ask -- can you give us any sense of where you are currently within this? You said you're above the 45- to 50-day range, but you're not at the 75 to 80. Where are you in that range? Do you think you'll get to the maximum? And is this any -- very similar to '09 or more dramatic?","Lynn J. Good","Jonathan, we are at about 90% of the peak levels of 2009, so we're not quite to the point we experienced in 2009. And the teams are very focused on managing through this, taking all the steps we think are necessary, including off-site storage and other measures. So we're managing through it and believe we will be able to manage through it.","Operator","Moving on to Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, there certainly seems like there's some momentum with the conversations you guys are having with the staffs in North Carolina and South Carolina. But can you just maybe mechanically or logistically walk through how a settlement would synchronize from the states with trying to get a FERC decision done and how they would marry together? Because obviously, they're kind of early stage or dependent upon the FERC decision, how that would all play out in June if things worked as you guys have them scheduled right now?","James E. Rogers","Absolutely. Dan, first, let me say that our aspiration is to get a decision from the FERC in early June. In the interim period, we're working with the public staff in North Carolina, as well as the consumer council in South Carolina, to reach settlement agreements that we can present to the state commissions for their approval. We've had detailed conversations with the public staff in North Carolina. Our discussions have focused on what is the appropriate treatment for the $110 million investment in transmission. It has been focused on some additional flexibility with respect to our guarantee of $650 million in the joint dispatch and fuel blending. It's also been focused on other items such as our sale of electricity during the interim period. So we are very close to reaching agreement with the public staff, have not reached agreement with other parties with respect to this in North Carolina. And so more to come there, and we hope to have a settlement soon. With respect to South Carolina, we're also working very closely with Dukes Scott and his team so that we can satisfy his requirements. And I think an important part of the relationship between North and South Carolina is that Dukes Scott negotiated early on a Most Favored Nation's Clause, which really allows them to track whatever agreement is reached between us and the public staff in North Carolina.","Lynn J. Good","And so, Dan, maybe just to put those things together, the intent would then be to be in a position where the commissions could approve this settlement following FERC approval in that June time frame.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So because the commissions wouldn't decide, basically, you'd have a -- this settlement which could then be adjusted if the FERC makes adjustments and then -- and bring it to them so they wouldn't actually have to revise what they had done because they wouldn't have made the decision.","James E. Rogers","That's a very good observation on your part. We are building in a provision in our settlement that we're working through now with the public staff for the possibility that the FERC will not fully embrace our proposal and will modify it in a way -- one way or another. And if that happens, then we have the capability to really reopen the agreement we have with the public staff and make any adjustments that are appropriate given the FERC's action.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just one other question. You guys have talked on a merged basis of 4% to 6% earnings growth as the target without any equity. Are you still feeling comfortable with that at this point in time? And do you feel comfortable without the equity needs, given some of the loss of cash you guys have with the Edwardsport deal and some of the loss of cash that Progress put up in the Crystal River deal?","Lynn J. Good","Dan, we are still targeting the 4% to 6%. We think the combined company has the fundamental growth drivers of investment and load synergies, of course, will be very important to drive that growth. We will be finalizing guidance as we near completion, restart integration, get a better sense of synergies, timing, et cetera, and be prepared to give you more specifics post closing.","Operator","Moving onto Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question is on the -- primarily to Edwardsport and what, if anything, remains to be [indiscernible]. The -- you mentioned you're in the testing phase. Has the gasifier at Edwardsport -- hello, hello? ","[Technical Difficulty]","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Hello? My question was, has the gasifier at Edwardsport been tested yet?","Lynn J. Good","We were having trouble hearing you. Can you restate?","Operator","Mr. Wynne, are you still on the line? Sir, this is the operator. And Mr. Wynne has disconnected. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One real quick thing. When I go back and look your guidance for -- that you provided at the end of the fourth quarter call or during the fourth quarter call. Look at the USF&G. You expected it to be up year-over-year about $0.12. Nowhere in there is there any bullet points for O&M cost reductions. And yet, based on the commentary and what I'm seeing in the abbreviated data at the back of your release, it seems like you've actually managed O&M down a bit in the first quarter. Can you comment on that? Can you comment on expectations for O&M for the rest of the year relative to last year, both at USF&G and maybe at Commercial Power?","Lynn J. Good","And, Michael, let me respond on USFE&G. We actually came into the year assuming O&M would be flat, 2011 to 2012. And as a result of the weak weather that we experienced also, we are continuing to build in some flexibility for the possibility that load growth doesn't show up as strongly as we anticipated. We have taken some actions that now put us in a position to forecast that O&M will be down 2% year-over-year. This gives us some flexibility in FE&G as a result of the start to the year. So that's the way I would think about it. In commercial, a lot of the O&M in commercial can actually be tied to generation, specifically in Latin America. And so we look at that O&M a bit differently and really try to give you a sense of margin and other things that we see in those businesses.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. One other question just in terms of thinking about PJM coming up in the next couple of weeks, assuming the auction results are actually released in the next couple of weeks. When you guys look at the market just in general, do you still have the view that coal plants are needed at peak in PJM? And if so, is it entirely just scrubbed coal plants? or even -- does PJM still need some of the unscrubbed coal plants at the peak?","James E. Rogers","Michael, it's my judgment that in PJM, they still need all the scrubbed plants and some of the unscrubbed plants at peak period.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So when you think about market fundamentals or kind of what's normal or long term, either an unscrubbed coal plant, whether its energy or capacity, needs to set the clearing price or some other asset replacing that plant needs to.","James E. Rogers","I think that's right. I think, historically -- and let me see if I remember the -- I think it's about 85% on gas is on the margin in PJM. And I think that will continue to be the case, even though there's been a flip in gas prices and coal prices and a flip in the dispatch. Said another way, the gas units, particularly combined cycle units, are dispatching with the 7,000-plus heat rate before most coal plants or virtually all coal plants in the region.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, Jim. Last question, just Commercial Power, really Duke Energy International, any change in your thoughts about the growth outlook, especially with kind of the next year sharing at National Methanol, kind of what the growth trajectory of this business is relative to your U.S. businesses?","Lynn J. Good","Michael, I think we talked a little bit about growth on international as we put forward guidance. We think international is a very solid contributor to the company. It has growth prospects with the repricing of the contracted load in Brazil, and there's actually some information in the year-end package that might be helpful on that. We will also bring some new resources into the international business as we go forward. I think as you look at Commercial Power, growth is going to occur over a longer-term basis as we see capacity prices rise and, hopefully, a broader spread in energy.","Operator","Moving onto Brian Chin with Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, if the FERC says it needed another month to review this, and that sort of drags out the process into August, would you be willing to extend the merger agreement another couple of months?","James E. Rogers","Brian, I'm not going to speculate on what we'll do with respect to extending the time of July 8. We're going to wait until we get there and wait to see what orders we get from the FERC and from the commissions and address that issue at that time.","Operator","Moving once again to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","James E. Rogers","Hugh, I'm sorry. You dropped off somehow.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Hello?","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Mr. Wynne has dropped again, sir. We'll move on to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Known you for a long time, so a very, very simple question for you just concerning the merger. I just want to make sure that you're still very committed and still very excited about this merger.","James E. Rogers","We are very committed to getting this merger across the goal line. This is the third time we've filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We've reopened negotiations with both states in an effort to get this done. As the prior question from Brian was all about July 8, and in our judgment, there's adequate time for both the state and the FERC to act, so we can get this across the goal line. So I'm confident that we will. And if you had to put a probability on it, you'd say, more likely than not, we'll get it done.","Andrew Levi","And you're still excited about it, as you were when it was announced?","James E. Rogers","I don't know, at my age, if I'm excited about much. But...","Andrew Levi","Okay. Fair enough, Jim. You're still a young man. Come on.","James E. Rogers","Yes, yes, yes. But if you look at this transaction from a long-term perspective, this is -- positions us well for the future, and we wouldn't be continuing to work as hard as we've worked and our teams have worked if we didn't think this was the right thing going forward. So thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Andy Bischof with MorningStar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A question for you, I'm trying to get a grasp of the likelihood of an approval by the Indiana commission for Edwardsport. What discussions were had with the commission during Edwardsport? And how are their concerns taken into consideration?","James E. Rogers","Andy, as you might imagine, we didn't talk to the commission when we negotiated this settlement. We worked hard with the consumer council, who plays a very important role in the state, as well as the industrial group in Nucor. We had many negotiating sessions to get to that settlement. And I think what's important is, is by putting these parties together and presenting it to the commission, we're presenting to them a package that really allows them to address all the issues that have been raised in the proceeding and put this behind the commission, behind us and allow us to go forward to build what may be the last coal plant that will be built over maybe a decade or more, given the price of gas and given the new proposals from EPA with respect to carbon.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. So you're pretty comfortable that the commission will look favorably upon this agreement?","James E. Rogers","I'm hopeful because we've had a long history in Indiana, as well as other states, of reaching agreements with the parties and presenting settlements to the commission and having the commission approve them. And we hope that, that occurs here, and that's certainly our expectation.","Operator","Moving onto Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 2 questions for you, if you don't mind. The first one is on Edwardsport, and I have the same question that Hugh was trying to ask because I could hear him. But could you just give us an update as to how the test firing is going on the Edwardsport facility?","Lynn J. Good","So, Jim, I'll give it a try, and Danny Jamil is here to correct me when we get into maybe more detailed questions. But we have tested on gas firing of the turbines. We have scheduled tests for the gasifier within the next 6 to 8 weeks, and are moving through the start-up process in a very methodical way. We have operations teams on the ground, ensuring we have a smooth transition from construction to start-up to operation.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Have you had any issues come up yet with that, out of the course of the ordinary, I should say?","Lynn J. Good","I would characterize it as things that you would expect to happen as you're turning over systems and processes. Dhiaa, would you add anything to that?","Dhiaa M. Jamil","Yes. I mean, in any start-up, of course, you will have issues. And that's why you go through the testing. We did experience some, but I would not put it outside of the normal range that you would expect for a first-of-a-kind type of system.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. My second question is, I listened to the annual meeting yesterday. And, Jim, you made a statement saying about your commitment to new nuclear. And I just -- it's a clarification question, if you don't mind. You said 5% to 10% -- you're still interested in a 5% to 10% stake of Santee Cooper's stake. Now is that 5% to 10% of the total project or just Santee Cooper's piece of it?","James E. Rogers","It's 5% to 10% of the total project.","Operator","Moving onto Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","All my questions have been answered.","Operator","And Ali Agha with SunTrust has our next question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I apologize, I got on a little late. But on Edwardsport, assuming the settlement is approved, what does that mean, if anything, for the Phase 2 hearings that were separately going on?","James E. Rogers","This settlement resolves both Phase 1 and Phase 2 issues.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, good. And secondly, again, I apologize, you may have done this, but on an LTM basis, what are the utility ROEs looking like for your utility portfolio?","Lynn J. Good","Ali, we had a slide in the year-end package that had targeted ROEs and what I'd love to do is have Bill Currens walk you through that off-line.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know. I recall that. I've seen that. But I'm wondering, are you -- I know it's early in the year and all that, but still -- that is still the right target?","Lynn J. Good","I think that's right. As you know, third quarter is very important for the regulated business. So we'll continue to build on the progress that we've made first quarter, but on track.","Operator","Moving onto Greg Rice [ph] with Catapult [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Quick question on the merger again. If, for some reason, you guys saw a material reduction in the expected benefits of the merger, would you be able to call upon the burdensome effect clause in the merger agreement? And how would it affect this? And would this allow you to avoid having to pay a break-up fee?","James E. Rogers","Greg, the merger agreement is clear on the burdensome effect provision. It's clear on MAE provisions. It's clear on the reps and warranties. And I think rather than me trying to opine with respect to how these provisions will operate, I would urge you to read them and draw your own conclusions as to what effect they would have under the scenario that you presented to us.","Operator","Your final question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quick, just rate case time line in the Carolinas, when do you expect to file? More importantly, do you expect to get all of Cliffside's in the rates? And what portions of Buck county and Dan River would you get as well?","Lynn J. Good","Yes, so Michael, Buck was in last year's case, and we would file this year's case with the intention of picking up both Cliffside and Dan River. So kind of filing mid-year, maybe early third quarter. And with the planned in-service dates of those plants, we would be able to pick both of them up in this case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And does that include both the capital and the expected OpEx?","Lynn J.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Currens","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Review. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Group Executive and Chief Financial Officer.  ","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. This forward-looking information is based on Duke Energy as a stand-alone company, as regulatory approvals for our merger with Progress Energy are still pending. You should refer to the information in our 2010 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials. Note that the appendix to today's presentation materials include additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance, as well as our 2012 earnings guidance assumptions. ","In today's call, Jim and Lynn will review our fourth quarter and year end earnings and provide you with our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. We will also update you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress Energy. Additionally, we will highlight recent regulatory outcomes and our key priorities for 2012. After the prepared comments, Jim and Lynn will take your questions.  ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Rogers.","James E. Rogers","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We are extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some challenges, it was a year in which we continued to deliver on our commitments. Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments. ","From a financial perspective, we grew earnings, ending the year with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46, which is $0.03 higher than our 2010 results. Considering that extremely favorable weather contributed about $0.13 to the prior year, our 2011 performance is truly exceptional. These results exceeded both our original and revised guidance range. For the year, earnings from our ongoing modernization programs and strong performance from our international business helped offset less favorable weather, significant storm restoration costs and the annualized effect of customers switching in Ohio. Continuing our commitment to increase the dividend, we grew our quarterly dividend by about 2%. Our dividend is supported by a strong, regulated earnings base and we target a long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continued to finance our major construction projects at low interest rates and completed a new Master Credit Facility, supporting our liquidity. ","In addition to solid financial results, we also had strong operational performance. Safety is a top priority for us. I'm pleased to report that our safety record last year was the best in the company's history, and it represented the sixth consecutive year we have improved our safety performance. Our nuclear fleet performed very well, achieving a capacity factor of about 93% for the year. This marks the 12th straight year the fleet has been above a 90% capacity factor. Our nuclear fleet also established some quarterly records during the year. During the third quarter, we achieved a capacity factor of around 99.3% and set an all-time record by dispatching more than 15 million megawatt hours. Our fourth quarter capacity factor, at just over 95%, was also a record for fourth quarter performance. And for the fourth consecutive year, our nuclear fleet was ranked #1 among all other nuclear fleets in the nation with the lowest total operating cost per megawatt hour, as reported by the Electric Utility Cost Group. ","From a strategic perspective, our regulatory teams executed well during the year, advancing our strategy to obtain regulatory clarity in Ohio, as well as recover the cost of our modernization projects in the Carolinas. Our team in Ohio worked very hard to complete the move of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky to PJM and obtain approval of an Electric Security Plan or ESP that balances the interests of customers, the state, and our investors. I'm pleased the Ohio Commission approved our settlement with intervening parties in late November, and new rates are now in effect. The terms of the ESP provide Duke Energy Ohio with 9 bypassable stability charges of $330 million over 3 years. This gives customers the benefit of today's low market prices and allows us to transfer the generation assets to an affiliate. We have begun this work and expect to make a FERC filing in the near future. This move, which we have committed to complete no later than 2014, will provide greater clarity for our generation business. ","In the Carolinas, we reached constructive settlements and gained approval of customer rate increases. We also spent the year focused on advancing approvals related to our pending merger with Progress Energy, as well as planning our integration efforts, leveraging best practices across both companies. I want to thank each and every Duke Energy employee for their contributions to a very successful year. Despite a pending merger transaction, regulatory activity on many fronts and an aggressive construction program, our employees maintain their focus on execution and cost control. Their achievements and dedication to excellence are very commendable. Despite important challenges ahead of us in 2012, we are well-positioned to continue delivering value for our customers, investors and communities. For 2012, we are targeting an adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 on a stand-alone basis. Our earnings projections continue to support our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate, based off our 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. ","At this time, I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of the year and our 2012 earnings outlook.","Lynn J. Good","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll start with an overview of our annual results for 2011 before discussing our financial projections and related assumptions for 2012. For reference purposes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year variance disclosures are included in the appendix. As you recall, our original outlook for 2011 assumed adjusted diluted earnings per share would fall within a range of $1.35 to $1.40. We increased this range to $1.40 to $1.45 after the third quarter, primarily due to favorable weather and stronger-than-expected results at our Commercial Power and International segments. We ended the year with adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share, slightly above our revised guidance range and $0.03 higher than the prior year. To put this performance into perspective, it's important to remember that 2010 results included around $0.13 of favorable weather as compared to around $0.05 of favorable weather in 2011. ","Let me briefly discuss the primary drivers for each of our business segments during the year. At FE&G, less favorable weather and significant storm restoration costs continued -- contributed to lower earnings for the year. However, the negative impact was mitigated through strong operational performance, cost control and increased earnings from the continuation of our major construction projects. Strong results at International were supported by both higher contract prices and favorable average foreign exchange rates in Brazil and improved earnings from National Methanol. Our fossil fleet in Central America dispatched more frequently due to lower hydrology and stronger results in Peru included a favorable arbitration award. At Commercial Power, results for the year were down due to the net effect of annualized customer switching in Ohio and exit fees related to our transfer from MISO to PJM. However, this segment performed significantly better than our original EBIT forecast. For example, our Midwest Gas fleet produced better-than-anticipated earnings as a result of strong energy margins and another record year of generation volumes. Other significant earnings drivers for the year included interest expense and taxes. First, interest expense was higher as we continued to finance our major construction projects. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued $2.5 billion of fixed-rate debt at a weighted average rate of 3.3%. Finally, the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%, slightly favorable to our expectations of 32%. ","In summary, we had a strong year and are well-positioned to continue achieving our financial projections and objectives in 2012. Our results demonstrate the positive benefits and the diversification in our businesses. ","Turning to Slide 12 -- turning to Slide 7. Let me just not jump ahead here. Let me provide an update on the economic conditions and related customer load trends within our regulated service territories. For 2011, we finished the year with an increase of about 0.2% and weather-normalized volumes slightly below our expectations. Continued economic volatility kept commercial and residential volumes relatively flat, but industrial volumes grew by about 1%, with strong results from the automotive sector. With continued expansion of the manufacturing sector, our major industrial customers are feeling more confident about 2012. And given the increasing levels of consumer confidence, we are cautiously optimistic. Because the economy hasn't quite recovered from high unemployment, challenging housing markets and Europe's fiscal uncertainties, however, we expect growth to be modest. ","From an economic development perspective, our service territories continue to attract new jobs and new capital investment. For example, BMW has announced it will add 300 jobs this year and invest nearly $900 million to expand its South Carolina plant, and Daimler has announced it will hire 1,200 workers at its freightliner plants in North Carolina. For 2012, we are projecting overall load growth of approximately 0.7%, led by a 1% growth in both Industrial and Commercial. ","Now let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Jim mentioned, today, we are initiating our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45. Slide 8 contains a waterfall chart with the significant drivers expected from each of our segments, as compared to our actual results in 2011. But first, I want to highlight that we will no longer report adjusted EBIT for each of our segments. Instead, beginning with the first quarter of this year, we will report adjusted net income. This new reporting measure will involve an allocation of interest and taxes, as well as corporate governance to each of the segments. Our other category will primarily include captive insurance results and interest expense on our holding company debt. For your reference, net income projections for each of our segments for 2012, as well as comparable amounts for the prior year, are included in the appendix. ","Let's start with a discussion of FE&G, which is expected to contribute approximately 75% of our consolidated net income for the year. In 2012, we expect segment results to increase by around $0.12. This is supported by the investments to complete our fleet modernization program in our most recent rate cases in the Carolinas. These base rate increases, effective earlier this month, along with other rate riders, are expected to generate increased earnings for the year. As I previously outlined, we expect modest weather-normalized retail load growth for the coming year. For sensitivity purposes, a 1% change to our retail load growth impacts earnings by approximately $0.03, assuming the change is evenly distributed among our customer classes. Partially offsetting these positive drivers are increases in depreciation expense and a reduction in debt and equity AFUDC, both resulting from the expected 2012 in-service dates for our remaining major construction projects and the impact of the Carolinas rate cases. In addition, we removed the $0.05 effect of the favorable weather from our 2011 results, as our projections for 2012 assume normal weather. Also note that we are targeting O&M to be relatively consistent with 2011, as inflationary impacts are offset by less anticipated storm restoration costs. ","Next, let me move on to our Commercial Power segment, which contains our nonregulated Midwest generation, as well as our Renewables business. This segment is expected to contribute less than 5% of our consolidated earnings for the year. Segment results in 2012 are expected to decline as we begin to recognize the financial impact of the new ESP in Ohio, which was effective January 1. Historically, our coal-fired generation in Ohio was dedicated to serving our native load customers, and for customers that had not switched, we received negotiated ESP rates that were above market. In our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation will dispatch into PJM and will receive an energy margin, as well as PJM capacity revenues. Currently, these amounts are less than what we collected under our prior ESP. However, the decline is partially offset by an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge, which Duke Energy Ohio will collect for 2014. Within the fully competitive environment in Ohio, we expect to continue pursuing opportunities to capture margins, both inside and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail is expected to contribute about $0.02 of earnings, a reduction of around $0.03 from the prior year. Finally, contributions from our Midwest gas-fired fleet are expected to decline slightly, primarily due to lower PJM capacity revenues. ","Next, our international businesses delivered record earnings in 2011, and we expect strong operational performance this year as well. The segment is projected to contribute about 20% of our consolidated results for 2012. For the year, we expect an approximate $0.04 decrease in earnings contribution, largely driven by 3 factors. First, during 2011, we had a favorable $20 million arbitration award in Peru that will not recur. Also we expect the average Brazilian foreign exchange rate and our O&M expenses for the year to be slightly unfavorable. ","Now let me briefly mention some of our consolidated expense items. These are included in the projected net income for each segment as outlined in the appendix to our presentation. Our overall interest expense is expected to increase around $0.04 as compared to the prior year. Of this amount, about $0.01 relates to holding company interest, which is included in other. Even though we expect a low interest rate environment in 2012, the full year effect of our 2011 financings is expected to result in an increase to our consolidated interest expense. ","Finally, our consolidated effective tax rate for the year is projected to be around 31%, which is consistent with 2011. ","Turning to Slide 9. I'll now discuss our expectations for capital expenditures. In 2011, we spent approximately $4.5 billion, and we expect 2012 CapEx to be fairly consistent, at $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. In 2013, CapEx is expected to trend down slightly as we complete our remaining modernization projects and a significant number of renewable projects later this year. Over the 3-year period, from 2012 to 2014, we expect to deploy about 80% of our forecasted CapEx into our regulated businesses, consistent with our overall business mix. Overall, annual capital expenditures at FE&G are expected to range between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion. Of this, approximately $2 billion is related to ongoing maintenance capital and nuclear fuel for our regulated fleet. The remaining $1 billion to $1.5 billion is targeted toward growth investments, such as completing our major construction projects, our grid modernization program and environmental compliance spending. Our nuclear fleet is also performing a series of upgrades, which will add additional net capacity of around 100 megawatts when completed in 2014. These upgrades are expected to be completed at a cost of less than $2 million per megawatt. As we enter 2013 and 2014, we expect to begin increasing our environmental spending. After the recent finalization of the utility mercury rules, we refined our CapEx estimates. To comply with the new regulations, as well as potential rules, which have not yet been finalized, including air emissions, coal ash and water intake, we could spend around $5 billion over the next 10 years. This is at the low end of our previous $5 billion to $6 billion range. Over the next 3 years, we expect to spend about $1 billion for environmental compliance. ","In our nonregulated businesses, we expect to deploy ongoing maintenance capital of $100 million to $200 million, as well as make investments to strategically grow our renewables portfolio. In anticipation of expiring wind tax incentives at the end of the year, we expect to spend around $500 million to complete 770 megawatts of contracted renewable projects by year end. Finally, we continue to maintain a level of discretionary capital for both our nonregulated and regulated businesses, giving us future flexibility to pursue projects. The significant capital investments we anticipate making in our regulated businesses lead to rate-based growth over time. This rate-based expansion is one of the more significant drivers in achieving our targeted 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate. ","Slide 10 gives you a view of the growth potential in the regulated businesses. As outlined on the previous slide, we expect to invest capital of approximately $10 billion over the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014. Of this amount, about $5 billion is maintenance capital, which substantially offsets our depreciation expense. The remaining $5 billion is expected to add to future rate-based growth. From these investments, rate base could expand from the current level of $25 billion to around $30 billion by the end of 2014, principally in the Carolinas. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. ","As the result of our significant investments in the regulated business, we expect to file rate cases to update customer rates for these costs. A regulatory calendar with our current rate case timing assumptions is included in the appendix. Another driver for potential rate-based growth is investment in new nuclear, and we anticipate receiving our COL for the Lee Nuclear Station in South Carolina in 2013. We expect to invest a total of $100 million between 2012 and 2013 as we continue to pursue this option. Also we continue analyzing our option to acquire a 5% to 10% interest in the new nuclear reactors at DC Summer [ph], but we have not yet made any firm commitments related to this project. ","Let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 cash flow assumptions and financing plan, which are contained on Slide 11. As we enter the year, we are well-positioned with stable outlooks on our investment-grade credit ratings, along with strong liquidity, which was around $4.5 billion at the end of 2011. Our liquidity is supported by our recent $4 billion 5-year credit facility, involving 30 financial institutions from around the world. This facility supports the company's commercial paper programs and replaces Duke's previous $3.14 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in June of this year. Another $2 billion of credit under the facility will become available upon the successful closing of the pending merger with Progress Energy. As outlined on this slide, we have around $1.9 billion of debt maturing in 2012, principally focused in the Carolinas and Ohio. In order to fund these maturities and our cash flow requirements, we expect to issue around $2.2 billion in financings during the year. These financings will mostly occur at the operating utility level, as well as in our international and renewable portfolios. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate making about $200 million of voluntary contributions to our pension plan. Our plans are currently fully funded based upon Pension Protection Act requirements. We remain committed to maintain the strength of our credit ratings, and our current business plans do not require any incremental equity issuances through 2014. Details on our projected credit metrics for 2012 can be found in the appendix. ","Before I close, let me discuss the primary drivers supporting our ability to achieve our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate. As you see on Slide 12, investments in the regulated business and resulting rate-based increases are expected to drive earnings growth over time. Next, we expect to see long-term, average, weather-normalized load growth of about 1%. As I mentioned previously, each 1% change in customer load results in an EPS impact of around $0.03, or approximately 2% earnings growth. Increased wholesale transactions are another growth area for our regulated businesses. We enjoy a strong base of existing customers for whom we offer competitive power supply options. We have recently extended several existing full requirements contracts and have attracted new wholesale customers. For example, in 2009, we partnered with South Carolina's largest electric cooperative to provide power under a long-term contract beginning in 2013. Peak demand for this contract is projected to grow annually to around 900 megawatts by 2019. Our wholesale agreements involve creditworthy counterparties, stable returns and formula rates that true up annually, thus eliminating any regulatory lag. Based upon our current plans and rate case timing assumptions, our entire wholesale origination business is expected to add incremental margins of around $0.02 to $0.03 annually through 2016. In our nonregulated Midwest generation, growth will be supported by margin expansion and increases in future PJM capacity prices. We also expect to realize contributions from investments in our Renewables business, our International business and from strong economic conditions in Brazil. And of course, as we demonstrated during the recent weak economic environment, cost discipline is an available lever to help us achieve our long-term growth rate. ","In summary, I'm pleased with our historical financial performance and how we have delivered on our commitments. For 2012, our focus will be on achieving our earnings guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and continuing to increase the dividend. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","James E. Rogers","Thank you, Lynn. I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress Energy. Recently, Duke and Progress jointly extended the initial merger termination date to July 8. We still have merger-related proceedings open with FERC, and with both the North and South Carolina Commissions. As you may remember, in December, the FERC rejected our proposed mitigation plan because of market power concerns. We were disappointed by this action. As we continue to finalize our analysis of the FERC order and the development of our revised mitigation plan, it is important that this plan balances FERC's market power concerns with the ability to retain the benefits of the transaction for our customers and our investors. We are considering both short-term and long-term mitigation provisions. Our longer-term solution will likely involve building new and upgrading existing transmission to improve the import capability of power into the control areas. On a short-term basis, until the transmission upgrades can be completed, we would offer firm sales of capacity and energy into the wholesale markets. Before we file with FERC, we are required to make a 30-day notification filing with the North Carolina Commission. We expect that a filing could be made next week. On a parallel track, we will also be seeking clarification on certain state rate making issues. A potential merger closing date will ultimately depend on the regulatory approval process. ","Now let me turn to the status of our major construction projects. As you see on Slide 14, 2012 will mark a milestone year in our modernization program. We expect to bring more than 2,000 megawatts online with the completion of our remaining major projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River. In November, we brought the 620-megawatt combined-cycle Buck plant online, and we expect it to be completed under budget. Because of low natural gas prices, Buck has been running like a baseload generating unit. It is currently dispatching just after the nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River are anticipated to be in service by the end of this year. Cliffside had a successful first fire on oil in January, and its first fire on coal is targeted for the second quarter. At Edwardsport, construction is essentially finished, and the startup phase is more than 60% complete. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines expected later in the first quarter. ","Let me bring you up-to-date on the regulatory proceedings related to the proposed cost increase for Edwardsport. In January, we completed extensive hearings on both Phase I and Phase II of the project before the Indiana Commission. We presented a strong case, including extensive testimony from independent, respected experts. After thorough analysis and review, these experts testified that the company's decisions and management of the project were prudent, except for around $12 million in costs related to pursuing deep well injection system. Post-hearing filings are scheduled to be complete by mid-July. Therefore, a commission order is not expected before the end of the third quarter. We continue to believe the cost of Edwardsport project were reasonable, prudent and necessary. ","Before moving on, let me give you a quick update of the growth we expect in Duke Energy renewables through 2012. We have 5 major wind projects currently under construction, which will nearly double the company's existing wind generation capacity by the end of the year. The projects will add almost 800 megawatts of wind power into operation, increasing our total wind generation fleet to around 1,800 megawatts. ","Turning now to Slide 15, we recently received commission approvals to increase our customer base rates in both North and South Carolina. Revised rates became effective in early February. In North Carolina, customer base rates increased by about $309 million or an average of 7.2% for each customer class. In South Carolina, the Commission approved an increase in base rates of approximately $93 million, an approximate 6% average customer rate increase. In both states, the increase is based upon a return on equity of 10.5% and a 53% equity component of the cap structure. To help mitigate the impact of this rate increase to customers in North Carolina, we had deferred cash recovery of Cliffside CWIP about $1 billion until the next rate case. We're pleased the Commission's approved the constructive settlements we've reached in both North and South Carolina. Along with the settling parties, we were able to strike a balance between the economic challenges facing our customers and the company's need to recover its capital investments. These projects will ensure our customers in the Carolinas have access to reliable, cleaner and affordable energy well into the future. ","Moving to Slide 16. I want to highlight our total shareholder return metrics. One of the company's key objectives is to deliver competitive returns for our shareholders. We monitor our success by comparing our stock price and dividend return performance against our peers, as well as the broad markets. We performed exceptionally well in 2011. Our dividend payment and growth objectives appealed to investors, especially with the overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Our current dividend yield is about 4.8%, which is very attractive in today's market. For the year, Duke's total shareholder return was 30.3%, which exceeded both the 19.3% return on the Philadelphia Utility Index as well as the 2.1% for the S&P 500. Additionally, as outlined on this slide, our shareholder returns over the past 3 and 5-year periods significantly exceeded both indices. We remain focused on continuing to position the company for long-term shareholder value. Our highly regulated business mix and our expectations to continued growth in the dividend offer opportunities for attractive shareholder returns. ","Before we take your questions, I'll quickly highlight our key priorities for 2012 and forward. For the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on the day-to-day business of serving our customers and delivering strong operational performance. We will work toward constructive regulatory outcomes in the merger with Progress Energy, in cost recovery for Edwardsport and our planned rate cases. For the longer term, we will continue to work to advance our legislative and regulatory priorities. We plan to complete the remaining 3 major capital projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River, as well as bring 800 megawatts of wind power into operation by the end of the year. The strength of our balance sheet will support our ability to grow earnings and increase the quarterly dividend. Our standalone 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 positions us very well to achieve our long-term targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. ","We've covered a lot of information today, so let's open up the phone lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, can you just talk a little bit more about how you see the timeline working on once you file the statement with North Carolina on the remediation plan? You have 30 days, and then it goes to FERC. How would see that playing through, best case scenario, to getting to a point of resolution on the merger?","James E. Rogers","Dan, my judgment is that -- I mean, we've actually spent almost 2 months trying to finalize our analysis of the FERC order and the development of this revised mitigation plan. This has proven to be a very complex analysis, and we've really worked to try to address the concerns of the FERC and at the same time address the concerns of our State Commissions. And in many senses of the word, we're really trying to thread the needle between federal and state policy. In terms of how it'll play out, I'm almost reluctant to predict the timeline, given what has happened in the past. But I think a best-case scenario is that the North Carolina Commission will review for 30 days, and maybe it will take them a shorter period of time to review it. Then we will file with the FERC, and then the FERC will take 30 days for comment from the various parties, and then they will deliberate roughly 30 days and then issue our order approving the merger, along with a joint approval of our joint dispatch agreement, as well as our tariff. So you can see that the timeline plays out by late May, June. I'd say mid-to-late May, we will, in all likelihood, have an order from the FERC. And then we expect orders from the state commissions, both North and South Carolina, after they've had an opportunity to review the FERC order and the issues that are pending before them.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And I'm going to ask a relatively impolite question, so I apologize in advance, but, given the fact that you guys have been able to put up better numbers and maintain your growth rate while Progress' numbers have, I guess, deteriorated expectation-wise from when the deal was struck, is that causing you or the Board to have any reconsideration on the overall value of the transfer, or the acquisition, I guess?","James E. Rogers","Well, we consider -- we continue to look at the performance of Progress. They've had a few issues in Florida that they seem to be working through. I think the important point here is this, you have to look at this deal both in the short and the long term. And we continue to analyze their performance. And over time, we're on a path to get approval of this. And so again, more work to do, more information to gain as we move through the process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Kind of a question along the same line as that. As I look at the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration, and I think about it in the context of the merger, presuming we reconcile the issues with the FERC and the states. I have 2 questions regarding what your assumptions are in that 4% to 6% aspiration. One is, does it presume that your earned returns in the Carolinas, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky accrete to your authorized levels through synergies? Is that sort of one of the critical paths to getting to that range? And second, are you making any contingency assumptions in that range with regard to a negative outcome on Edwardsport, and for that matter, a negative outcome on Crystal River on the Progress Energy side in terms of write-offs and balance sheet impact?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, those are good questions. We continue to target 4% to 6%. And I'm talking about the combined company, because your question's directed toward the combined company. I think the fundamental drivers for growth will be in the regulated business, with rate-based investments, with rate cases, with load growth, and, as you said, demonstrated cost control in the form of synergies. I do think, over time, our aspiration with Duke has been to close the gap between the allowed and earned return, and we expect to be able to do that over time. And the range of planning assumptions that we look at, of course, include outcomes around Edwardsport and Crystal River. But as we've indicated, there's more work to do on a number of these things, including achieving the approvals to get the companies together before we can give you any specific guidance about the combined company.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But at least on the first question, it's fair to presume that somewhere in the midpoint of that guidance range is a scenario where the synergies drive your returns to their authorized levels?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, I wouldn't get as specific to authorized levels. What I would say is we'll close the gap between earned and allowed over time through a combination of costs and rate cases. I think to assume that we're going to be right on top of allowed returns is probably a stronger assumption than I would make year in, year out as I look ahead.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then post-merger close, to the extent there's guidance to be given on contingency plans or more information with regard to outcomes on Edwardsport and Crystal River, you'll brief us then?","Lynn J. Good","That's right. More guidance to come as we get closer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, on the International business, could you give us a number of how much cash you had at year end held overseas? And just also generally, International has been fantastic the last couple of years. Is there any part of that, that -- I know you mentioned that Peru arbitration is a little bit of temporary gain. But are all the gains you've seen in the last few years kind of sustainable-type growth, or is there some things we should be wary of that fall off over time?","Lynn J. Good","Steve, I think I'll take that one. On cash, we ended the year with close to $1 billion overseas. Some of that, of course, is directed toward working capital requirements in the countries. So I would think about maybe $500 million to $600 million as being something that we could readily repatriate if we chose to do that. Of course, we've not made that decision. As we think ahead, there's no question, International has had an exceptional year, and we do think there are some fundamental drivers to that business. The recontracting and repricing in Brazil has been a nice driver. We also continue to add a modest number of new resources that will drive earnings in the future. So we continue to think of it as a very important part of the business. As you know, there will be some volatility in variables such as hydrology, foreign currency, perhaps pricing of MTBE impacting National Methanol. But we believe the business is very well-positioned for the future.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. A couple other quick questions. Just -- do you have the gas capacity factors from the Odin [ph] assets for 2011? And maybe what they had been the prior year?","Lynn J. Good","Steve, I don't have a capacity factor number. But the generation almost doubled. It was kind of a 70% to 80% increase in generation volumes year-over-year, 10% to 11%. And we're projecting that, that could continue to increase into '12. So they're running well, we're running a lot.","James E. Rogers","Steve, the interesting point is, is that with gas prices where they are, both in MISO as well as in PJM, you see gas being dispatched before coal plants. In the Carolinas, we brought on the Buck plant, and it has great heat rate, low-cost gas, and it's dispatching just behind our nuclear and before our most efficient coal plants. So this is a good outcome for consumers with respect to the low price of natural gas.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One last quick question on the merger. Just based on your plan to update it, kind of market power-related solutions, do you expect the joint dispatch savings will still be in the range you've talked about before?","James E. Rogers","It's our judgment, they will generally be in that range. But we have more work to do with the changes that are occurring in gas prices, in coal prices. All of these have impact on what the joint dispatch savings will be. We continue to monitor that and update it as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Going back to guidance for a second, I apologize. The 4% to 6% you've characterized as long term. I know on the last quarterly call, there was some confusion as to whether it was off of 2009 or off of sort of weather-adjusted 2011. So how should we think about that, is the merger obviously being delayed a little bit? And what's the right base?","Lynn J. Good","Jonathan, that's a good question. I think for Duke stand-alone, which is what we're talking about today, we're talking about a base of 2009. We haven't advanced that base for Duke stand-alone. We did advance the base for the combined company, as you recall when we announced in January, and so we will, as I said, give guidance and specifics around the combined company when we get closer to closing.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you're not reiterating 4% to 6% for the combined company? Is that what you're saying?","Lynn J. Good","We continue to target 4% to 6% for the combined company with the drivers that we've talked about, investments in the business, synergies, et cetera. But as we've said, with work to do around the timing of the closing, the synergies, the approvals, North and South Carolina FERC, we have just some more work to do to finalize where we are, and we will continue to update you as we make progress. We're continuing to target the 4% to 6%.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On another topic, picking up on something else. Could you give us a view of where you are in terms of coal inventories today, how that's marrying up with your contract situation and any efforts to defer deliveries, et cetera?","Lynn J. Good","Yes, Jonathan. The outgrowth, as you know, of dispatching the gas plants ahead of the coal plants is we're not running the coal as much; this is particularly the case in the Carolinas and in Indiana. The coal inventories are up. We are continuing to look at that very closely, also addressing issues with our contracts. We think we've got a plan to manage through it. But there is some market issues resulting from the low gas price environment. We are in a very good situation in Ohio. We have more flexibility on the way we've contracted in Ohio. And so not much, if any, issue at all in our nonregulated business.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So would you say your coal piles in the Carolinas are kind of up to the levels they reached in 2009 yet? Or is that sort of somewhere you're heading towards?","Lynn J. Good","Jonathan, I don't have a specific comparison of today versus 2009. I'd be happy to look at that, but I haven't looked at that statistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Lynn, one question -- 2 questions. One on the transmission comments you made regarding the merger. Can you give a little bit more detail in terms of, are we talking about sizable transmission investment measured in the billions or are we talking about 1 or 2 kind of smaller, even 345 KB type of lines into the state? That's my first question. And second, can you provide any detail about the coal that you've hedged for your fleet in Ohio, in terms of just how long that's been under contract, how long you might have it under contract going for? Whether those contracts are kind of above or below market?","Lynn J. Good","Let me talk about transmission first, and then I'll move to Ohio. As Jim mentioned, Michael, we are proposing or will propose as part of our mitigation plan a longer-term solution to the market power issues, which will include building new and upgrading existing transmission. We are estimating the cost to be about $100 million. That of course will be refined as we go through this process. We'll be presenting specific details to the FERC on these projects. And of course, we'll get feedback as we move forward. We will also be discussing those projects with the North and South Carolina Commission. Jim, did you have something to add?","James E. Rogers","Yes, I'm just going to add with respect to the coal. Our plants in Ohio are all on the river. And so as a consequence of that, we're able to really take advantage of the spot price. And so we really don't enter into long-term contracts as we might in the Carolinas or in Indiana. So that's why we're in relatively good shape there, because of the term of our contracts with the coal suppliers.","Lynn J. Good","And Michael, we are fully hedged in Ohio for 2012, a modest amount of coal secured for '13. And I'm not going to comment on market price of the coal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the questions regarding coal for gas switching. In particular, what are the biggest impediments for your Commercial Power fleet and your U.S. FE&G fleet to capitalize on lower gas prices? I wonder if you could maybe comment on the difficulties with handling your coal contracts or commitments, your rail contractual commitments, and, for that matter, the difficulty of serving load during peak demand months like the summer, when both the coal and the gas fleets may be called into service. Can you guys give us a little bit of color on what the operational challenges are to respond to these new relative prices of gas and coal?","Lynn J. Good","I'll comment on the Commercial business, and I'm sure Jim will have something to add. I feel like our Commercial business here is very well-positioned to operate in a low gas price environment. As I mentioned a moment ago, their generation volumes have just continued to steadily increase in this market condition, and we see that continuing from '12 to '13. And those assets are run directly into the market based on price signals in the market. We're prepared to run any day and every day and have had very consistent run times for those gas assets. In the coal fleet, now that we're completely situated in the wholesale market, the coal fleet, nonregulated, we run them in an economic manner. If the coal is in the money, we run them. If it's not in the money, we don't, and maintain flexibility in the way we contract for coal to make that operationally successful. On FE&G, I think we've got a nice portfolio mix. I think about the Carolinas, what dispatches first is the nuclear plant. We're now bringing Buck in behind the nuclear plants but still get into the coal stack at various times of the year and continue to look at ways that we can introduce flexibility into coal contracts. And I think that's part of everyday business and will continue to be.","James E. Rogers","I don't see any threat to our ability to meet peak demand because of the low gas prices or the blend of our coal and gas assets in meeting demand. I think we're well-positioned to meet any peak demand that we may have in the coming summer or future summers.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Lynn or Jim, I wanted to come back to your comments, and again, just looking at Duke stand-alone, dive a little bit more into the growth rate. The 4% to 6% you talked about from the '09 days, which implies to us mathematically that if we were to push it up to 11%, the number would be mathematically lower than that, just given the way the math has worked. But when I look at the numbers you've given us for '11 through '14, you're telling us rate base is growing 6% a year, ROE is trending up, there's no equity issues so there's no dilution coming to the equity. So I'm a little confused in terms of the disconnect between the rate-based growth '11 through '14 and the implied EPS growth for Duke stand-alone, '11 through '14?","Lynn J. Good","Ali, the rate-based growth is always going to be a bit stronger. The rate-based growth is always going to be a bit stronger than EPS growth as we look about financing the business. We've looked at inflationary impacts on O&M and other costs that would go into an EPS view. I think what we are saying is that we feel like we have a number of opportunities to continue to invest in the FE&G business, which will be a fundamental driver for growth.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you're not assuming any major drop off in either International or the unregulated Commercial business to offset that? I mean, I didn't hear that from any of your earlier comments.","Lynn J. Good","Ali, if you look at the waterfall from '11 to '12, you do see a resetting of Commercial in light of the current market conditions. And so that business will be one that will continue to work through what I would call a low commodity, low capacity price environment for '12, '13. And then over time, it will demonstrate growth around energy margins and capacity prices.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my other question, Jim, going back to Edwardsport for a second, can you just update us? There was the other Phase II discussion going on regarding broad concealment and gross mismanagement. Is that issue finished, or is that out there? What's the latest on that?","James E. Rogers","That was part of Phase II, and that issue has been -- the witnesses have been presented and there's been cross examination and it's completed. Both Phase I and Phase II are now in the process of being briefed for the Commission and proposed orders will be presented to the IURC for approval.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And so in both cases, you expect third quarter timeframe?","James E. Rogers","That's our best guess at this time. Given the fact that the briefs have to be completed by July, I think that's a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Hey, 2 quick questions. One is following up on the coal to gas switching questions, do your gas plants have any limitations under their air permits with respect to capacity factors?","James E. Rogers","It's my recollection that our new Buck plant has no restrictions. In fact, it's actually been running a little bit above its nameplate, in the production of electricity, which we're very pleased with, of course. But with respect to our other gas plants, I think they're all running consistent with the permits that were granted when they were cited.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So then I guess a follow-up question is this, can those air permits be amended to increase those capacity factors?","James E. Rogers","I think they could, but I don't think we need to, actually; it could've been [ph] how they're currently structured.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Now the second question is on the lead project. Where do you stand with respect to the EIS? The Environmental Impact Study?","James E. Rogers","We're going to turn to Dhiaa Jamil, who is our Chief Nuclear Operator, to address that.","Dhiaa M. Jamil","The draft EIS was issued late last year, and we are currently in the comment period, which will end in March. Then after that, we'll follow the published schedule for the final environmental impact statement.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","March this year or March next year?","Dhiaa M. Jamil","March this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions, unrelated, one on the coal to gas switching. Can you tell us what your capacity factors, coal and gas, in the Midwest were December, January, February, roughly?","Lynn J. Good","We don't have specific capacity factors by month available.","James E. Rogers","If you call Bill Currens and his team, we'll put together that information for you.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then an unrelated question, what type of target payout ratio are you thinking about on the 4% to 6% growth that you've talked about?","Lynn J. Good","We're targeting a dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70%, which we believe is an appropriate range, given the level of capital spending that we have and growth expectations.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Currens for any closing or additional remarks, please.","Bill Currens","Okay. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for the Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Review and Business Update. As always, the Investor Relations team is available for any follow-up. Thanks, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8182":["Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","William Currens - Vice President, Investor Relations","Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer","Steven Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Hugh Wynne - Bernstein Research","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir.","William Currens","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance.","As listed on Slide 3, Lynn will begin with an update on our principal first quarter activities. Then, Steve will review our 2015 first quarter financial results, including an update on what we\u2019re experiencing in Brazil. Finally, Steve will close with an update on economic activities within our service territories as well as a review of our recently announced $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With the first quarter behind us, I\u2019m pleased to report that we are on track to meet our financial objectives for the year and are demonstrating strong operational performance for our customers.","We are making progress on our near-term objectives and achieving important milestones on the strategic initiatives we announced last year, including growth investments totaling $8 billion. Our strategies reflect a focus on new generation investments, electric and gas infrastructure and contracted renewable opportunities.","Now, let\u2019s focus on the quarter. This morning, we reported first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $1.24. We also affirmed our full-year 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Steve will provide more details on the quarterly results in a few minutes.","Let me start with reviewing a few operational highlights as outlined on Slide 4. I\u2019m pleased with how our system performed during record cold temperatures during the first quarter. On February 20, we set new all-time peak demand records in the Carolinas. Our teams demonstrated exceptional preparation and collaboration across the company in meeting this challenge.","Our generation fleet performed well during the experience of record demand as our customers benefited from our diversified portfolio of generation resources. The regulated natural gas fleets at a record for the quarter delivering more than 12 million megawatt hours.","The performance of our nuclear fleet continued to improve, serving as a valuable resource of baseload generation to our customers. The fleet achieved a quarterly capacity factor of almost 94%, led by the Robinson and Harris plants which set generation records for the quarter. We also recently learned that our nuclear fleet as a whole led the nation\u2019s large nuclear fleets in 2014 as measured by several key performance indicators.","Our operational teams also responded to a series of major winter storms. In the Carolinas alone, three severe storms caused more than a million outages. We used the scale of our company to effectively prepare for and respond to these challenges. For example, in one major storm, we deployed more than 3500 workers and restored power to 85% of the affected customers within 24 hours.","Our ability to restore service in the wake of storms was recognized in March by EEI. We were awarded the institute\u2019s Emergency Recovery Award for our restoration efforts in the winter of 2014.","Our Edwardsport IGCC plant in Indiana also performed well during the first quarter. We believe the best measure of performance for Edwardsport is over a long term basis. However, it\u2019s worth highlighting that the plant achieved 79% gasifier availability, representing its highest individual quarter yet.","After last winter\u2019s challenges, we made a number of enhancements to the plant, driving this year\u2019s performance. We expect orders in the Indiana Commission on several pending rider proceedings around mid-year.","We\u2019ve made significant headway on other important strategic and regulatory priorities, which I will briefly cover on Slide 5. We achieved a major milestone in our proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of jointly-owned generating assets from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. State legislation that enables these municipalities to issue revenue bonds was finalized in March.","And it also allows Duke Energy progress to recover through a rider mechanism, its retail investment and operating costs associated with the acquisition. This important legislative milestone follows last December\u2019s approval by FERC. We remain on track to close the acquisition later this year once we receive approvals from the NRC, all 32 individual municipalities and the state regulatory commission. Once closed, we expect an annualized incremental earnings per share impact of between $0.05 and $0.10.","The plan to acquire these generation assets is a win-win for all parties involved. The municipalities in eastern North Carolina get rate relief which will be a boost to economic development in the entire region. And our Carolinas customers will enjoy significant fuel savings from the addition of valuable nuclear and coal generation capacity to our supply mix, helping to mitigate the impact of the purchase on retail customer rates.","In March, we filed with the FERC for approval of our proposed purchase of Calpine\u2019s Osprey combined cycle gas plant in Florida. This 599 megawatt plant will help offset the impact of system retirement. If the Osprey purchase is not approved in a timely manner, we have requested state commission approval to build 320 megawatt of new combustion turbine capacity at our [Swany] site. We have requested FERC approval by July 30.","In early April, the Ohio commission approved our next three-year Electric Security Plan, or ESP. the commission approved our request for two important rider mechanisms, a distribution capital investment rider and a storm cost rider. Parties including Duke Energy Ohio have until May 4 to file for a re-hearing. We are evaluating this option for certain provisions in the order and will provide updates as needed.","Earlier this week, the Florida legislature passed new utilities regulations, including a provision allowing securitization of our remaining Crystal River 3 costs. This law is still subject to being signed by the Governor. As you will recall, our 2013 settlement in Florida included a provision allowing for us to begin recovering up to $1.46 billion of Crystal River 3 assets and customer rates by beginning of 2017.","The securitization would allow us to provide a significant rate benefit to our customers, while also providing full cash recovery of these investments. If signed by the Governor, we anticipate seeking Florida commission approval later this year to issue bonds in early 2016.","Also in early April, we successfully closed the transaction to sell our Midwest Commercial Generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash. With the sale complete, we\u2019ve been able to sharpen our focus on the regulated business and quickly redeploy the proceeds to ensure an accretive transaction within the first 12 months. In a moment, Steve will discuss the use of proceeds.","Our International business has been experiencing challenges due to the continued drought conditions and a softening economy in Brazil as well as weaker foreign currency exchange rates and lower MTBE prices at National Methanol. Steve will provide more detail on what we are experiencing during his prepared remarks.","Next, I will provide an update on our coal ash management activity. We have been taking action to improve our management of ash across each of our jurisdictions in a manner that protects the environment and our communities. As you may recall, in February, we reached a proposed plea agreement with the US government. If approved, the agreement would close the federal investigation related to the Dan River coal ash spill and basin operations in North Carolina.","In April, the Judge granted a four-week continuance of the hearing to May 14 to allow the court more time to prepare. As a consequence of this [indiscernible] plea, we\u2019re working through an agreement to avoid debarment with the EPA. We have been working for some time on this proposed agreement and our target is to have it in place by the hearing on May 14.","If an agreement is not in place by this date, for some period of time, we would need to obtain prior approval before entering into new or modified contracts federal government agencies. This is not expected to result in any material financial or operational impacts.","We have been actively working on plans to close all of our ash basins in North Carolina under the provisions of the Coal Ash Management Act. We are required to obtain permits before beginning execution of ash at the initial four high priority sites. These permits which we applied for last year are being reviewed by DENR. We expect to be able to begin moving ash later this year.","We also continue to develop plans for our remaining 10 sites in North Carolina and finally we expect to begin moving ash from our W.S. Lee plant in South Carolina later this month. Environmental matters including EPA regulations are certainly a focus of ours over the coming years. The EPA\u2019s proposed Clean Power Plan creates aggressive state specific targets to reduce CO2 emissions. The plan is scheduled to be finalized this summer and includes some of the most far-reaching and complex regulations the industry has ever faced.","We continue to engage with the EPA and states in support policies that reduce carbon emissions over time without jeopardizing reliability and affordability. This is not a one side solution to this issue, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that our states maintain flexibility as they develop plans to comply with the final targets.","I will also mention that the EPA published its final coal combustion residuals rule in the Federal register on April 17. This new rule regulates the disposal of coal ash and is applicable to all new and existing landfills, structural fills and new and existing ash basins at active sites.","We have already begun a site by site evaluation to determine our plans for compliance with these Federal provisions across each of our jurisdictions beginning later this year. Additionally, in North Carolina, we must also comply with the state\u2019s Coal Ash Management Act, which requires a closure of all basins in this state over the next 15 years. Since the federal and state rules contain some conflicting provisions, such as different compliance, timelines and groundwater monitoring requirements, our actions will be based upon the most restrictive provisions.","We have already recognized the $3.5 billion in asset retirement obligations for our North Carolina sites to comply with the state legislation. The new federal rules would result in actions in our other jurisdictions, in particular Indiana, where most of the remaining ash is located. We will recognize incremental asset retirement obligations for the federal rules in the second quarter. However, similar to the North Carolina rules, any closure costs are expected to be incurred over a long-term time horizon.","In closing, we are on track to meet our objectives for the year with a strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline. We are moving forward responsibly in our ash management plans. We are successfully executing on the growth projects and strategic initiatives announced last year, positioning Duke Energy for long-term success.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Young","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results and discuss the economic conditions within our service territories, including retail customer volume trends. I will also provide an update on Brazil\u2019s challenging economy and ongoing drought conditions. Finally, I will briefly review the accelerated stock repurchase plan we launched in April with the Midwest Generation sale proceeds.","Let\u2019s start with the quarterly results. I will cover just the highlights on Slide 6. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today\u2019s press release.","We achieved first quarter adjusted diluted earnings of $1.24 per share compared to $1.17 in the first quarter of 2014. Strong results from our Regulated Utilities and commercial Midwest Generation business helped offset weakness at International.","On a reported basis, 2015 first quarter earnings per share were $1.22 compared to a net loss of $0.14 last year. The loss in last year\u2019s reported results included the pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion or $1.23 per share related to the Midwest Generation business.","Let me briefly review the key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities delivered higher results of $0.05 per share, primarily due to increased wholesale margins and higher retail rates, including energy efficiency cost recovering mechanisms. Similar to last year, we experienced cold weather during the quarter. So it was not a significant quarter over quarter driver. These positive drivers were partially offset by a slight decline in weather normalized retail load growth. I will provide additional details on that in a moment.","Our Regulated Utilities also realized higher O&M costs during the quarter. As you will recall, in 2015, we are targeting increases of O&M cost at Regulated Utilities below the level of retail load growth. Our quarterly results were also impacted by the timing of items, including scheduled fossil plant outages, nuclear outage cost levelization and winter storm costs. We remain on track to achieve our targeted level of O&M cost during the year.","Our Commercial Power business contributed to increased earnings of $0.12 per share, driven by higher results from Midwest Generation. Earnings from Midwest Generation were supported by higher PJM capacity of revenues and favorable pricing on generation volumes, without significant hedge positions. Due to the sale completion, this is the last quarter that Midwest Generation will be included in our results.","Additionally, we incurred slightly lower quarterly results from our commercial renewables business due to lower wind production, which was experienced across the United States. This business remains on track to achieve its targeted $100 million of net income for 2015 as we put significant additional wind and solar capacity into service later this year.","International\u2019s quarterly earnings declined by $0.13 over last year, due to the factors we have been monitoring for some time, the ongoing drought, lower electricity demand and weakening foreign currency exchange rates in Brazil as well as low MTBE prices at National Methanol that are directly correlated with Brent oil prices.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing conditions in Brazil. Setting aside foreign currency, there are two key factors impacting results: generation dispatch order and demand for power. First let's discuss dispatch order.","In response to the ongoing drought, generation dispatch has fundamentally changed in an effort to preserve reservoir levels. Under normal reservoir conditions, low cost hydro generation is dispatched before the higher cost thermal generation. However, since the end of the rainy season in the second quarter of 2014, the system operator has consistently dispatched thermal generation first with hydro generation being dispatched as necessary to meet system demand. As a result, the hydro generators operate less and are now at the margin bearing the risk of softening demand.","This brings us to the second factor, demand for power. Brazil's slowing economy and the effective voluntary energy conservation efforts have resulted in lower demand for electricity. Brazil's demand for power has typically grown at greater than 3% over the past several years. We now expect demand growth for 2015 to be between 0% and 2%. This coupled with the impacts of the revised dispatch order results in significantly less hydro power production than in previous years.","As you compare our expected results in 2015 to what we incurred in 2014, there are several factors to consider, hydro dispatch, the allocation of shared energy and market prices. First, hydro dispatch in the first quarter of 2015 was much lower than what we experienced in the same period last year. As I described earlier, hydro generation is being dispatched after thermal and we expect this dispatch order to continue throughout the remainder of the year.","Secondly, in 2014, given the way the hydro system generators shape their shared energy for the year, we were allocated higher percentages of energy in the first half of the year with lesser percentages being allocated to the second half. In 2015, on the other hand, we are allocated less energy in the first half of the year and more in the back half. The combination of these factors has resulted in a short position so far in 2015, whereby contracted energy sales exceed the allocation of hydro generation.","We are required to settle this short position in the market at a capped settlement price or PLD of 388 reais per megawatt hour. In contrast, in early 2014, these same factors resulted in a long position whereby the allocation of hydro generation exceeded our contracted energy sales. In this situation, we were able to sell excess energy into the spot market at a higher market price of up to 830 reais per megawatt hour.","Over the remainder of the year, we expect to be in a net short position. However, the level of this short position should moderate over the second half of the year, resulting in greater comparability with the second half of 2014 and what we're seeing early in the year.","We are taking actions to mitigate some of the financial exposure we are experiencing. Entering 2015, we reduced our contracted position in Brazil from 93% to 91% and we are considering further reductions to our contracted percentage for 2016, if conditions do not improve.","We have also identified opportunities to achieve cost efficiencies throughout the International business and have already instituted headcount reductions of approximately 15% or over 100 positions. We will continue to evaluate further efficiencies as we move forward.","We will closely monitor impacts from the deteriorating demand for electricity as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate trends in Brazil. These factors will make it more challenging for International to meet its financial plan for the full year. We will continue to update you as the year progresses.","Moving on to Slide 8, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. As we outlined in the fourth quarter call, weather normalized load growth in 2015 is expected to be in the range of 0.5% to 1%. On a rolling 12 month basis, weather normalized retail load growth was down 0.2% through the first quarter.","Weather normalized load growth for the first quarter of this year is in line with our budget. However, the comparison to the prior year is challenging, as the first quarter 2014 results included 2.6% weather normalized load growth due to the unusual impacts of last winter\u2019s Polar Vortex.","Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.2% over the year. However, customer usage trends remain challenging, leading to a decline of 1.4% in residential volumes over the rolling 12 months. This decline is primarily attributable to the strong 2014 results that was also impacted by energy efficiency as well as changing usage patterns.","We continue to see favorable trends in the key indicators for the residential sector, namely full-time employment and median household income. I've discussed these metrics before and they continue to move in the right direction. Additionally, we see an increase in manufacturing jobs in our service areas, along with some positive data on new housing starts.","The commercial and industrial sectors continued to show growth of 0.2% and 1.2%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector is driven by declining office vacancy rates and expansion in the health and food service subsectors. As for the industrial sector, metals, transportation and chemicals continue to drive growth in the Midwest and Carolinas.","One factor that we are closely monitoring is the impact of the strong US dollar which could hamper domestic manufacturing activity. We have not seen any significant impacts of this dynamic with our industrial customers to date, but we\u2019ll continue to closely monitor trends.","Our economic development teams remain active, successfully helping attract new business investments into our service territories. During the quarter, these activities led to another $1.2 billion in capital investments being announced, which is expected to result in almost 3,000 new jobs across our six-state footprint.","Before closing, I\u2019d like to briefly cover the mechanics of the recently launched $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program, as outlined on Slide 9. In early April, after closing on the sale of the Midwest Generation business, we began the program. We immediately received and retired 16.6 million shares, which is 85% of the total expected to be retired. The program will be completed by the end of the third quarter of this year.","The actual number of shares repurchased will depend upon the daily volume weighted average price of our stock during the term of the program. The timing of the close of the sale was ahead of what we planned for in our 2015 earnings guidance presented in February. This allowed us to accelerate the deployment of the proceeds and launch the share repurchase.","Additionally, the Midwest Generation business contributed stronger results during the quarter than we expected, earning almost our full six-month assumption in just three months. For the full year, the early close of the sale and timing of the ASR are slightly favorable to our overall financial plan, offsetting some of the weakness being experienced at International.","Slide 10 outlines our financial objectives, both shorter term and longer term. We have a strong established track record of achieving these objectives and remain on track to continue meeting them in 2015. The strength of our balance sheet underpins our ability to access the debt markets on reasonable terms. This helps fuel our growth strategy, support the dividend and maintain low cost rates for our customers.","In early April, we were pleased to receive an upgrade to our credit ratings at S&P. This upgrade resolves S&P\u2019s positive outlook on the company which was initiated last fall. Related to the dividend, we have reached our target payout ratio and the Board now has the flexibility to consider growing the dividend more in line with our earnings growth over time.","We are off to a strong start to the year in our Regulated business and are executing on our strategic initiatives. We are closely monitoring developing trends in our International business and are taking actions within our control to react. We expect unfavorable variability in the International business in the second quarter due to the factors I previously discussed as well as the absence of a favorable tax benefit in Chile that impacted prior year results. This negative variability to the prior year is expected to moderate in the back half of the year.","We are also taking a hard look at our cost structure. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 guidance range of between $4.55 to $4.75 per share and continue to target earnings per share growth of between 4% to 6% through 2017.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers","Is the usage comparison down at this point in time? Is that really just a function of the math behind the first quarter 2014 kind of trying to discern weather versus usage or is there something more structural happening? I couldn't figure out what that first quarter comp is doing to this number.","Steven Young","I think that the first quarter\u2019s comps are influenced by what happened in the first quarter of 2014. Let me recap a bit. We\u2019re about flat on the rolling 12 month variance. Overall, industrial is 1.2% growth, continuing being around 1% which we\u2019ve seen really since 2011 on a consistent basis.","Commercial has been growing also, it grew at about 0.2%, that\u2019s lower than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, but we continue to see in the Commercial sector some strength as vacancy rates are declining, health care and food service are strong. We did see some softening in government a bit, but overall I think with new people moving into our service territories, Commercial is poised to continue to grow.","Residential is where we saw the decline. And there, I do think part of the decline in residential of 1.4%, roughly half of that you could attribute to the anomaly of the 2014 results of the Polar Vortex. There people were literally forced to stay at home due to the weather and was hard to model that accurately.","When I look at residential, I do continue to see usage per customer going down due to energy efficiency, due to people living more in smaller spaces, condominiums and apartments than perhaps we\u2019ve seen in the past. But on the flip side of that, I also see that we are adding customers particularly in the Carolinas and Florida sector very strongly. We see unemployment continue to decline and median household income rise, we also see some favorable housing data, existing home sales are increasing, which should lead to some new home building. So those are factors that offset the energy usage.","The question we ask is when does the saturation hit on energy efficiency at residential and when does the core growth overtake that? So we will keep an eye on those factors. But I think the fundamentals of our service area economies are ultimately very solid.","Daniel Eggers","So the 0.5% to 1% makes sense on an ongoing basis. So your view is we shouldn't get too caught up in this usage comp right now because there's going to be some friction in the weather adjustments?","Steven Young","That\u2019s correct. I think that will be always rolling 12 month average, the base periods going to have some of that and it\u2019s from the Polar Vortex of 2014, I think I would look at other trends there as well. And I think 0.5% to 1% is certainly still a reasonable estimate for where we are going.","Lynn Good","Dan, the one thing I would add is that if we look at these results relative to how we plan the year, we\u2019re on plan, so that\u2019s another indication of the fact we think we\u2019re tracking with our expectations.","Daniel Eggers","And I guess just on International, you've given the obviously slow start to the first quarter and probably rough looking second quarter, given the Brazil dynamics. What is your confidence in getting to the full-year guidance you guys have laid out for there? And if you're coming in light there, where do you see the business making up more of that earnings?","Steven Young","I think the International segment will have challenges meeting their targets, which were set in February at about $345 million of net income. We recognize that and have discussed that thoroughly. I think there are offsets to that in our other businesses. We have seen favorable weather in the first quarter and that\u2019s in the bank, our ability to accelerate the share repurchase program due to the early closure of the sale is accretive to us by in the neighborhood of $0.04, we were fortunate and that we got our full earnings estimate out of the Midwest Generation business in the first quarter. It was a very good quarter for that business. So the acceleration to share repurchase should all add to the bottom line to us. So that\u2019s favorable as well. So I think you got levers in our cost structure as well to pull that can help us offset some of the shortfalls in International.","Lynn Good","The other thing I would mention, Dan, is we\u2019ve been moving more rapidly to the approval process on the acquisition of the generation assets from NCEMPA. In our planning, we assumed all of that benefit was in 2016 and it looks like we\u2019re tracking ahead of that. So that\u2019s another thing I would point to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim.","Shahriar Pourreza","So just on the International business, Steve, you provided pretty good sensitivities around Brent and exchange rates. Is there any way to price the risk around the weak hydrology conditions and even sort of what you're seeing from an economic development in Brazil?","Steven Young","Shah, that\u2019s difficult to put a sensitivity to. It is hard to predict the impact on demand on electricity usage, it\u2019s more volatile than in the US. Last year, it was 3.7% for the entire year and it was over 7% in the first quarter and then changed throughout the year. So it\u2019s more volatile there.","Additionally, it is difficult to predict what the spot pricing might be, given the lower demand, the cap is 388 reais, but where spot pricing sells under that cap was hard to know and that affects the bottom line there. So it\u2019s hard to give a sensitivity there, we\u2019ll just have to keep an eye on it as we move forward.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just in the US, seems like you're in a really good spot. You've sold the assets in the Midwest; you're doing the buyback program. Could we maybe just get a little bit of a refreshed view on your growth avenues? And maybe just focusing a little bit outside of the current gas projects, generation projects may be centered around more midstream or muni acquisitions in the area?","Lynn Good","Let me take a shot and then Steve can add to it. I think around the jurisdictions on where growth is coming from and if we start in Indiana, it\u2019s grid related growth. We filed for $2 billion investment in the grid related reliability and optimization projects. That\u2019s moving through the regulatory process. We also have distribution and transmission investment in Ohio and in the remarks we mentioned the fact that under our ESP, we have an approved tracker which gives us timely recovery of those investments which we think is positive.","I think in the Carolinas, you\u2019re familiar with the generating assets, gas plant, the pipeline, you\u2019re familiar with. We also are investing $500 million in solar, about half of which of that will be owned generation. And then in Florida, we have close to $2 billion in investment on generation in the Citrus County and Osprey or Swany investment. So those are the things I would point to as unfolding or moving through regulatory approval processes on each one of those. And of course, continuing to look for ways that we can put capital to work for the benefit of customers.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just one last question around the dividend, currently, maybe we could just get a viewpoint on the policy, especially as your earnings growth trajectory is where it is, kind of where you will be around the target range of where you want to be.","Steven Young","Our dividend has been growing at 2% and of course our earnings have been growing in the 4% to 6% range. And that was just to help calibrate it and get back within our target range after the issues that occurred during the financial crisis and the merger with Progress. And we\u2019ve now gone to a point where we are within that target range, at the upper end of it. So our Board will consider that as we move forward, but ultimately our goal would be to have the dividend growth closer to the earnings growth rate. So that\u2019s where we are headed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein","I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the puts and takes of the securitization bill in Florida for Crystal River.","Lynn Good","Michael, it is a legislation that has passed both Houses. It is awaiting signature from the Governor. It is a part of a regulatory reform bill that worked its way through the House and Senate in Florida. And we see it as a great opportunity for us to bring a rate reduction to our customers, so that when the Crystal River investment goes back into rates, it will go back into rates at a lower amount for the benefit of the customers in Florida. And it does also give us accelerated recovery of the cash investment as we would securitize the investment.","We still have some gates to go through, Governor\u2019s signature being one that I mentioned. We will also need to file for approval with the Florida Commission. We'll need to issue the bonds and then we will give you more perspective on where we see opportunities to put that capital to work on a go-forward basis. But this is something that I think strategically is very valuable to our utility in Florida and to our customers in Florida.","Michael Weinstein","And have you had any indications at this point, this early stage, about how capital or coal ash remediation might be treated? Will it be given full base treatment or is it something that would be similarly securitized in some way?","Lynn Good","We are early in the process of beginning the actual investment of dollars around the ash remediation. You may recall that our first commitment is to excavate four sites between now and 2019. In our capital plans for that period, we are at $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for those sites and are developing plans for the remaining sites. So the spending will ramp up over the next four years, but really continue for 10 to 15 years as we address the remaining sites.","Our intent would be to present these costs for review by the North Carolina Commission later in the decade when we have a regularly scheduled general base rate case. And that will be something that I would see maybe 2018, 2019. And that's the path we are on at this point, Michael. And our focus is getting the approvals from the state necessary to begin the excavation and movement of ash. And that's been our primary focus at this point.","Michael Weinstein","One last question, I think you mentioned that you thought the second half of the year would be better than the first half of Brazil, I'm just wondering if you could explain that a little more.","Lynn Good","We were talking about comparability to prior year, Michael, so let me ask Steve to weigh in.","Steven Young","Yes. What we were referring to is, as Lynn said, comparability. I think Brazil will be challenged throughout the year because demand is lower. There have been informal rationing implementations that will affect demand as well. But it will be more comparable to the last half of 2014, as thermals were dispatched in the last half of 2014, and some the similar effects that we are seeing now started to move into place. That was the reference we are making there.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Hugh Wynne with Bernstein Research.","Hugh Wynne","I wanted to follow-up on a couple of those recent questions regarding coal ash and the International operations. You mentioned that the ARO in North Carolina was about $3.5 billion. Does the Indiana ARO for coal ash removal likely to be of a similar magnitude or are you expecting it to be materially less?","Steven Young","We would expect that to be less, Hugh. There's less wet tonnage of ash in Indiana, it's roughly a third and we are running numbers now. We will probably disclose a range in the upcoming 10-Q and book it in the second quarter. But it will be a smaller number than what we've seen in the Carolinas.","Hugh Wynne","And are these costs, are these future removal costs primarily expenses or a very substantial portion of them likely to be capital investments?","Steven Young","Hugh, the way the accounting works on coal ash here is that we will book an estimate of the liability here and the offset to that will be plant in service and assets, or for retired plants or regulatory asset. And then we will work with the regulators on recovery of these costs and effectively amortize the regulatory assets in conjunction with the regulatory treatment from the regulators. So that's the way it's going to appear on the books, primarily on the balance sheet, until we understand recovery mechanisms at this point in time.","Hugh Wynne","And that will be kind of a commission-by-commission discussion, whether there's any return allowed on some portion of these outlets?","Steven Young","Well, that's correct. Ultimately, the Commissions will determine what's to be recovered over what time frame, they will have great flexibility to that. And I would add, as actual costs are incurred, they will be charged against the overall liability that's booked on day one, again, balance sheet oriented until we know what the Commission recovery mechanisms are.","Lynn Good","Hugh, I would think about this as a decommissioning type cost, that is something that the industry and certainly we have been aware of for decades. But we are reaching a period where not only are we retiring plants, but we now have federal legislation and in the case of North Carolina, state legislation.","All of our jurisdictions have addressed federally-mandated costs in a constructive way over time. And so we are executing this to achieve closure in the time frames required and the methods required. And we will continue to update you on both the costs that we incur as well as the timing for presentation to regulators.","Hugh Wynne","Just a quick question, follow-up question on Brazil, is your expectation that it's going to take a period of quarters or even years for hydroelectric output to normalize? I guess, in my mind, I'm thinking that if hydroelectric facilities are anything like bathtubs, you'd probably have to have more water go in than is coming out for the level to rise, and that might take several years of normal or above-normal hydrology. Is there a kind of a permanent, I shouldn't say permanent, is there a long-term drag to the earnings power of the hydroelectric assets in Brazil as a result of these two years of drought?","Steven Young","Well, Hugh, one thing I might state there, I do believe that the Brazilian authorities will continue to run thermals through the next rainy season, which will carry you into 2016. So that will have some dampening effect on Brazil results in and of itself. Beyond that, it is hard to say what pricing might be contracting levels and demand might be. Brazil has a number of issues going on politically, social unrest, et cetera, that could affect these results. But the one thing I would say is I do think thermals will be dispatched through another rainy season.","Lynn Good","And Hugh, we have in the slide deck, back in the appendix, sort of a tracking at the reservoir level. I think to your point, the reservoirs are low, but they're moving up. I think the rainy season in 2015 will be extraordinarily important. And the system operator is using thermals as a method of restoring those reservoirs. That, coupled with weakened demand, is increasing the reservoir level. And I think that ultimately will be a big indicator of how long the country continues to experience the effects of the drought.","Hugh Wynne","Can you provide any color on your comment regarding the threat of debarment and what impact that might have on contracts with the military or other elements of your Commercial business?","Lynn Good","And so this is a consequence, Hugh, of the plea in the investigation that we entered into in February. And we have been working actively through reaching an agreement on this, and have a hope and expectation we can finalize by May 14. But if not, we will continue to move forward working to resolve this issue.","It only relates to new and modified contracts. So we do not see an impact in our ability to provide power to the important bases that are in our service territories. We do not see any material financial or operational impact as a result. But it's a consequence, we need to work through it and that's what we are focused on.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure","I wanted to circle back to Florida and the securitization of the Crystal River 3 money. Was this expected by you guys? How does it fit into your financing plans over the next couple of years and your prior statement that you don't need equity through 2017, I think and also could you quantify the potential number for the securitization for us?","Steven Young","Some of the facts there, I think the securitization will be around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. And the way it will mechanically work, as Lynn said, early in 2016, if things move along properly, is when the securitization would occur. But the proceeds will be used, half of the proceeds will displace and take out some operating company level debt down at Duke Energy Florida. The remaining half proceeds will be dividended up to the parent and will be used to help fund and finance growth projects. And this was not in our initial financing plan that we presented back in February.","Christopher Turnure","And then going back to the North Carolina muni purchase, you mentioned it's going along a little bit faster than you had originally anticipated. What's the potential timing there for final closure now? I guess it's at some point before year-end, but when do you think specifically the NRC will come out with their decision?","And then also my understanding was that you didn't need any kind of specified regulatory recovery mechanism there, but you got this rider in the legislation that was signed early last month. Could you just clarify that a little bit and if anything has changed versus how you expected to recover the assets?","Lynn Good","So I think, Chris, you've got the elements there. There are three approvals required, NRC, and we are hopeful that that will move through over a few months. So we expect that to be before the end of the year. The thing that's interesting about the NRC approval, these are plants we already operate. We operate the Brunswick and Harris plants. So we will be working through that diligently to secure that approval. Then the 32 municipalities need to approve. We think that will occur quite quickly over the next month or so. And then we need approval from the NCUC.","The rider mechanism that you talked about has already been approved through the legislature, so it will be a matter of implementation here in the state. So when we look at the big issues that were obstacles to closing, it was FERC approval and it was legislation. We've cleared those. And so the ones that remain, we think, can go rather quickly, giving us an opportunity to close sooner than we anticipated.","Christopher Turnure","So the rider doesn't improve your outlook in any way? That was expected and that's required to close and it's all set?","Lynn Good","It is, from a cash standpoint, it's a rider, so you get more timely recovery, cash recovery, Chris, and we would always have assumed that we could record some return.","Steven Young","And from an earnings standpoint, the profitability from this is the tended wholesale contract with these same municipalities. They were self-supplying when they owned the asset; we bought the asset. We will now supply them at a FERC-regulated rate. We purchased the asset at a price that did not distort retail rates in any fashion. So it's fairly revenue neutral there. The profitability is on the large wholesale contract that follows it.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Could you just remind us, as you're thinking about the plan today, how important to the 4% to 6% through 2017 this 0.5% to 1% sales growth is? I appreciate there's some noise in the numbers right now. And maybe just related to that, I know you said you're going to take a deep look at the cost structure. Are you kind of positioning for an eventuality where if the sales growth doesn't materialize, just how should we think about those pieces?","Steven Young","Sensitivity, Jonathan, on the sales growth that we've thrown out is that a 1% organic retail load growth would translate into roughly 2% earnings growth. So that's a metric to give you an idea of what it means in terms of earnings per share and growth trends and that kind of thing. So it's obviously critical for us, particularly between rate cases to see load growth from our organic businesses there.","In terms of do we anticipate a downturn there? I think the 0.5% to 1% is still a reasonable growth trend to project on. We are always looking at our cost structures and trying to find flexibility. We are a large company with a lot of different operations and we have levers that we can pull.","Jonathan Arnold","But you're not considering starting to plan off of a lower number to just have a bit more comfort that you can hit this number or is that, at this stage, not saying that, by the sound of it?","Steven Young","No, it's too early to try to move in any direction on that. I think the growth estimates are reasonable given what we are seeing, but we are always trying to prepare and be ready for other circumstances.","Jonathan Arnold","And then just one other on International, I was just curious, you're talking about headcount reductions. Just given the nature of the business, predominantly hydro footprint, what kind of flexibility do you really have there? And how should we think about how that changes the positioning of business going forward?","Steven Young","I think in terms of cost reductions, we have identified over 100 positions. There's various administrative, corporate office type positions that are examined and support roles. So that has been acted upon and will help offset some of the losses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","A quick question. Steve, I think I heard you say that the strength at merchant and the ASR will offset some of the pain in International?","Steven Young","Yes, that's correct.","Paul Ridzon","And then just a clarification, did you say the ASR happening sooner than anticipated was $0.04 accretive to previous use or is it $0.04 absolute?","Steven Young","It's $0.04 to the plan that we had submitted. And let me give a discussion here. In the first quarter, our Midwest operation earned, it provided earnings that were equal to what we projected for a six-month period. We had, in February, projected that the sale would occur and close mid-year. And so we had the Midwest Generation in our results for six months and about $95 million of earnings during those six months.","They got those earnings in the first quarter and then we closed the deal. That allowed us to accelerate the timing of the initiation of the share repurchase. And the share repurchase provides benefits to us happening earlier, roughly one quarter earlier, within the neighborhood of $0.04 compared to our original plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Almost all my questions have been answered. Just to clarify, though, you guys said that you are taking a hard look at your costs. And Jonathan asked about this. I just am wondering, though, you guys are always probably taking a hard look at your costs. I mean, is there anything that we might think of as being potential cost cutting program, et cetera, that could, in case whatever, some factor here or there doesn't work, that could help you meet the numbers if there was a hiccup, let's say, more International or sales growth, whatever, I'm just wondering, do you see it \u2013 is there something new that you're identifying or how can you \u2013 could you just elaborate a little bit on that?","Lynn Good","I'll take a shot, Paul, and Steve can certainly chime in. I think this organization has demonstrated great discipline with cost. And when you think about where we've come post-merger integration projects, corporate center benefits, moving into the operations, consolidating work management tools, the nuclear fleet, working together over a several year period, we continue to look for ways to optimize our investment and optimize the operation of our business. And that is not going to change.","And so I would not point to any single thing. I would just point to ongoing financial discipline. When we make commitments, our expectation is that we will deliver those commitments using all the levers that exist in the company. And making the right risk reward trade-offs, because, at the end of the day, we want to provide reliable service, maintain a safe operation and commitment to employees. So it's no one thing, but it's just ongoing financial discipline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller","I was wondering going back to the retail usage trends, particularly on the residential side, I suppose. Are you seeing any kind of penetration on distributed generation at all and what might change that?","Lynn Good","It's modest at this point. So we are a company with 7.2 million meters. We serve about 20 million to 25 million customers and we have about 5,000 to 5,500 rooftop installations. I do think that there is an ongoing interest on the part of customers to pursue distributed generation when it makes sense for them. I think the one distinction that I might make in many of our service territories, our retail rates are extraordinarily competitive. We are 20% below the national average here in the Carolinas, as an example.","So the economics have not been as favorable as they might be in other jurisdictions where the prices are just frankly higher. So we think about our renewable strategy for the company, including economic forms of renewable investment, it's in primarily utility scale up to this point, but we do believe customers will have an interest over time if the economics continue to improve on distributed generation.","Travis Miller","And then I wonder if you could give an update on the Atlantic Coast pipeline, that, or even the projects that you have related to that?","Lynn Good","So the Atlantic Coast pipeline is moving through its early-stage development process with open houses, surveying, engineering work, still targeting a FERC filing later this year, with construction hopefully beginning in 2016, 2017. So it's on track and enjoys very strong support here in North Carolina, represents important infrastructure for the eastern part of the state not only to enable electric generation, but also for industrial growth.","Travis Miller","Do you wait for the FERC filing and any kind of approvals there before you start any kind of projects, power generation, et cetera, that would tie into that pipeline or is that something you can start before that?","Lynn Good","So we look at that infrastructure as being infrastructure that we are building over time, not for any one plant but to continue to provide diversification supply and infrastructure over time. So we've built five combined cycles over the last three to five years. We have another one planned for 2018. And all of those over time underpin this infrastructure, but I wouldn't tie any given plant to the expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Just wanted to get a sense of on the \u2013 you mentioned the $0.05 to $0.10 on the North Carolina, the municipal acquisitions. Can you just remind us why there's this variance of $0.05 to $0.10, how we can end up at $0.10 versus $0.05?","Steven Young","What we\u2019re thinking about there is basically the financing of it. It's roughly a $1.2 billion investment. Half of that will be through Opco debt and absorbed in the retail and wholesale rates. The other $600 million is the $0.05 to $0.10 range, dependent on, it was financed with cash or with equity. We are not going to issue equity here, but that just gives you an idea of the range. I would think about that more in the midpoint of that range in terms of what it's really going to yield.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","So thank you all for joining us today, for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. I think we'll see a number of you maybe in May at conferences, but we'll look forward to our second quarter earnings call on August 6. So thank you for joining us today.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"7989":["Duke Energy Corp.

We delivered strong operational and financial results, ending the year at the high end of our guidance range. We completed our multiyear transition of our business portfolio, with the well executed exit from our International operations and the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. Through it all, we maintained strong earnings growth in our core businesses and continued to increase our dividend. 2016 was clearly a pivotal year for Duke Energy and it's a key indicator of the success we expect going forward.","As you see on slide 4, today Duke Energy enters 2017 with premier electric and natural gas franchises operating in constructive jurisdictions and with a demonstrated track record of strong execution. With our scale and portfolio of complementary businesses, we benefit from a wide range of investment opportunities. And as you will hear today, we're excited about our five-year $37 billion growth capital plan, up approximately 25% from last year.","We have strong growth in every segment underpinned by capital, delivering value to our customers. Today, we extended our consolidated growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2021, which is off of the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70. Our capital plan and regulatory strategy has been designed to produce earnings within this range each year of the five-year plan. And as the investments build and recovery accumulates, we're even more confident of our ability to reach the high end of the growth range.","The assets we have, coupled with the strategy that produces real results, offer a solid long-term investment opportunity. We are positioned to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low risk, predictable and transparent way, providing an attractive risk-adjusted shareholder return for our investors. As a capital-intensive business, our growth is supported by the scale and strength of our balance sheet, which remains the continued focus for our company. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment.","We have a great story to share today. And in a moment, Steve will provide details on our five-year capital plan. I want to spend the next few minutes offering insight into our long-term vision for Duke Energy and where we plan to take our company in the next decade.","Our industry is undergoing transformation, from increasing customer and stakeholder expectations to rapid technology development and new public policy requirements. The companies that succeed in this dynamic environment are those who anticipate and adapt. We see great opportunity in this period of transformation. And our focus is highlighted on slide 6, investing in infrastructure, our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors.","Slide 7 shows how that vision is manifested. We will invest at areas that position us well for this transformation; strengthening and modernizing our energy grid, generating cleaner energy through natural gas and renewables, and building natural gas infrastructure to support the growing need for this important resource, and by building on a foundation of customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement. Everything we do begins with customer service, and we also understand that working collaboratively with our stakeholders is critical to our success.","To paint a clearer picture of where we're going, we pulled back the lens and outlined on slide 8 our aspirations for the next 10 years. We will relentlessly pursue our goal of achieving and sustaining top quartile customer satisfaction, placing the customer at the center of everything we do. We will strengthen our energy delivery system, investing $25 billion to create a more modern, smarter energy grid. We will generate cleaner energy through natural gas and renewables, investing $11 billion as we move to a lower-carbon future. We will expand our natural gas infrastructure to meet customers' needs, doubling earnings contribution of our natural gas business. And we will enable more timely recovery of revenues in all of our jurisdictions, as we work to improve regulatory cost recovery mechanisms.","Of course, any success we achieve is grounded in our commitment to maintaining industry-leading safety standards and operational excellence remains as the foundation of all we do. Our success starts here. Today, Duke Energy leads the industry in employee safety, and we will continue that leadership in the years ahead. This is our path. It's ambitious and it's achievable.","Let me spend a few minutes on each investment area. First, turning to slide 9, I will discuss grid modernization and our objective to improve system performance and enable additional capabilities through smarter energy infrastructure. Our transmission and distribution network is the largest in the nation, and on its own, our Carolinas system is the sixth largest. Our scale requires consistent capital investment. But in this era of transformation, the demands on our system have never been greater.","And while the system is reliable, recent events such as Hurricane Matthew have highlighted opportunities to strengthen the grid. We have outlined a 10-year $25 billion plan to modernize, building a more flexible, reliable system. We have already begun this important work in the Midwest, with plans to expand it into our other jurisdictions. We're using data analytics to inform our investment plans, delivering the highest value to our customers. This work will direct our targeted undergrounding programs, as well as a number of other reliability and integrity upgrades. Additionally, new technologies available today will advance our energy grid and deliver services our customers and communities increasingly expect.","Our initial investment will focus on enhancing basic services with smart meters and communications technologies, increasing power quality and improving reliability. These investments will also support more distributed energy resources on our system. Subsequent capital spending will integrate emerging technologies, such as storage and improved remote monitoring, communications and control.","We expect to reduce our outage frequency and duration rates by 50%, and significantly reduce our O&M expenses through the deployment of more advanced technology. Much of this work will also support our goal of moving the company into the top quartile for customer satisfaction.","Our next major investment platform focuses on generating cleaner energy. I'm proud of our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, including reducing our carbon dioxide emissions by 29% since 2005. As you can see on slide 10, our retirement of more than 40 older, less efficient coal units, coupled with the addition of clean natural gas plants and renewable, is driving our emissions reduction.","In the next 10 years, we will invest $11 billion, increasing new, highly-efficient natural gas generation to 35% of our portfolio, and cleaner renewable energy sources to approximately 10%. These renewable energy sources include hydro, wind and solar. With these investments and our carbon-free nuclear generation, by 2026, we will reduce carbon emissions by 35% from our 2005 levels.","In addition to regulated renewables, we will also invest in commercial renewable assets, as we continue to pursue projects that meet our return criteria. Reducing our carbon footprint is important to many in our communities. We remain focused on being a leader with environmental stewardship at the forefront of our plans.","Moving to slide 11, our third area of investment focus is natural gas infrastructure. We look at the future of this industry and the future generation needs of our company, natural gas will continue to play a major role. With the acquisition of Piedmont, we now operate a five-state gas distribution business and have investments in midstream natural gas pipelines. We rank second nationally for natural gas consumption across our electric utilities and LDCs. This underscores how these business will continue to complement one another.","With more than 90% of our margins in the LDC business mostly fixed through decoupling and weather normalization mechanisms and our low-risk natural gas pipeline investment portfolio, we have very little exposure to volumetric risk in this business. Similar to our electric businesses, our LDCs, which serve more than 1.5 million customers, are located in states with strong customer growth of over 1% over the last five years, including customer growth of 1.5% at Piedmont.","Our growing midstream business is anchored by our investments in highly contracted pipelines such as Atlantic Coast, Sabal Trail, and Constitution. This infrastructure will bring much needed gas supplies to the Eastern U.S. for an economic growth and helping us grow our customer base in the Southeast.","Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a prime example of the tremendous overlap between our electric utilities, LDCs, and midstream pipeline investments, driven by transportation contracts with our natural-gas-fired plant and Piedmont. ACP will provide opportunities for industrial and manufacturing growth and infrastructure investment in our Eastern Carolinas communities. This growth, as well as combined heat and power, coal-to-gas conversions and dual-fuel projects will boost our gas business.","We look forward to benefiting from coordinated infrastructure planning between our electric and gas utilities as we prepare for new gas-fired generation facilities that will maximize this new gas platform. We also anticipate continued economic development opportunities across the region as a result. In the next 10 years, we expect our natural gas platform to account for 15% of our portfolio, up from 8% today, as we expand and scale our natural gas business.","Before turning to Steve, let me turn to slide 12 and touch on a few policy issues that are top of mind for investors. We are engaged with Congress and the new administration as they begin to address important policy issues impacting our company and customers. The President and congressional leaders have an ambitious agenda that includes a few particular areas of focus for us, including tax reform and infrastructure policy.","While it's early in the process and much work remains ahead, Duke Energy supports many of the goals of comprehensive tax reform, which could benefit our customers and support critical investments needed for economic growth. No specific legislation has been introduced, so we are working with the administration's campaign tax plan and the House GOP blueprint. We've analyzed a number of scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impact to our business.","Our preliminary analysis shows that the administration's tax plans, which would allow the option to retain interest deductibility and forego immediate expensing of capital, is neutral to slightly accretive for our company on a consolidated basis. On the House GOP plan, the range of potential outcomes will be impacted by a number of factors, including the treatment of existing debt and other transition rules. The loss of interest deductibility and immediate expensing of capital will impact our utility rate base over the long term.","But given our NOL position, it's not expected to have a material impact over the next five years. It's important to recognize, however, that loss of interest deductibility will permanently impact the cost of capital to our customers, whereas expensing is a timing difference. The most significant impact from the House GOP plan is on our holding company. If we assume the loss of interest deductibility on new and refinanced holding company debt and a lower tax shied on existing debt, the impact could be approximately 5% dilutive by 2021.","We all recognize that we're in the very early stages of this matter, and we will continue to update our analysis as more specific information becomes available. We'll also actively engage in advocacy on tax reform, along with EEI and other industry CEOs.","Given the capital intensity of our industry and the relatively high leverage percentage supported by regulations, we believe better tax policy should retain interest deductibility and forego immediate expensing of capital expenditures. This approach is recognized in the administration's plan, and we will continue to meet key stakeholders to advocate for our position on behalf of our customers and investors.","Turning to infrastructure, the regulated electric industry invests more than $100 billion annually in critical infrastructure, and Duke Energy accounts for nearly 10% of that figure, a welcome effort to streamline the siting and permitting of infrastructure project, such as grid investments and natural gas pipeline necessary to meet the long-term needs of our customers and communities. These topics are complex and will take time. We will be actively engaged with congressional leaders and administration officials to advocate on behalf of our customers and investors, emphasizing the critical role of low-cost energy in driving America's economy.","So that's a brief overview of our longer-term strategy, now, let me turn it over to Steve to walk through our five-year financial plan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. As mentioned, I am going to spend the majority of my time walking you through our five-year financial plan.","Turning to slide 13, we are introducing our adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share today. In addition, now that we have successfully closed on the Piedmont and International transactions, we will anchor our long-term growth rate off of the midpoint of our 2017 guidance range of $4.60. Over the next five years, we anticipate growing our adjusted EPS by 4% to 6%, consistent with the historic growth rate we have achieved in our domestic businesses.","In 2017, our results will be driven by our ongoing investments in electric and gas infrastructure and retail and wholesale customer growth. Positive results in the electric business will also be driven by our base rate increases in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina, and the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida. These positive drivers will be partially offset by higher depreciation, interest expense and other taxes, as we continue to place new assets in service.","Given that we have completed the International sale in December, we will not have results from that business in 2017. That will have an approximate $0.05 benefit from the use of proceeds from that sale, and another $0.05 contribution from National Methanol, which we retained and is now reported in Other.","Moving to slide 14, we have a robust five-year capital plan of nearly $50 billion in place to drive our 4% to 6% earnings growth. In fact, we have increased our growth capital plan to $37 billion, an increase of $7 billion, largely driven by grid modernization investments in the Carolinas and our growing gas platform. This investment plan will drive earnings base growth in our combined electric and gas businesses of approximately 6% over the next five years.","As we look at each of our segments' contributions, electric utilities and infrastructure, representing 89% of our adjusted earnings, is well-positioned to grow at 4% to 5% over the next five years. Our gas utilities and infrastructure business will contribute approximately 8% to our 2017 results, with a five-years growth rate of 10% to 12%.","And our Commercial Renewables segment, which includes owned wind and solar assets, as well as our operating services and third-party contracts, will contribute approximately 3% with a five-year growth rate of 8% to 12%. We are confident these businesses will generate stable earnings and cash flows delivering solid results in 2017 and beyond.","Turning to slide 15, growth in our electric business will be supported by our five-year $30 billion growth capital plan, the investments align with our strategy to modernize the energy grid and to generate cleaner energy. Our plan also reflects environmental compliance cost of over $4 billion, including approximately $3 billion to safely close ash basins across our system. These significant investments drive a strong earnings-based CAGR of over 5.5% for our electric business through 2021.","Now, let me walk you through additional details of our five-year plan for our electric business. On slide 16, you will see our focus on upgrading our transmission and distribution system. We have allocated nearly 60% of our $30 billion plan to transmission and distribution, which includes $10 billion for modernizing our grid infrastructure to make the system smarter and more reliable. The other $7 billion will be devoted to investing in our system for additional customer growth.","Nearly 45% of the capital we invest in the grid will be devoted to storm hardening to ensure our system is better prepared for severe weather events. We will focus on key projects, such as elevating substations located in vulnerable or low-lying areas, and making our power poles more resilient. We are also identifying areas more susceptible to frequent power outages using data analytics capabilities. This information will be used as we develop our targeted undergrounding programs where we have allocated 25% of our grid investment to increase the reliability of our system for our customers.","Another part of the program will include installing smart meters to provide better information and services for our customers, as well as additional cost efficiency. To-date, we have completed this effort in Ohio, and we'll be moving forward with smart meter installations in our other jurisdictions. We expect to fully deploy all smart meters across our system over the next five years. This accelerated deployment will allow us to offer additional products and services and help to reduce our overall O&M cost given that the advanced technology will avoid the need for many manual processes.","Moving to slide 17, we are committed to further reducing our environmental footprint, with plans for new natural gas generation and renewables. Our five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. This will include completing our Lee combined-cycle facility in South Carolina, our Western Carolinas Modernization Project in North Carolina, and our Citrus County plant in Florida, and beginning work on plants within service states beyond 2021.","We are pursuing additional generation projects, such as dual-fuel capabilities and combined heat and power facilities to increase the flexibility of our system, as we continue to meet growing energy demands in the dynamic environment. We will also increase our focus on additional renewables in our regulated utilities. Our $1.3 billion investment plan for carbon-free utility-owned renewables will be led by investments in Florida and the Carolinas.","Moving on to slide 18, we operate in attractive service areas where customer growth remains strong, especially in the Southeast, and continues to support load growth in our electric business. That, coupled with cost management, has allowed us to earn our ROEs even without significant rate cases since 2013. We are committed to earning these ROEs and generating stable earnings growth for our shareholders while we invest in infrastructure our customers value.","In 2016, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.2%. This was largely driven by lower-than-expected results in the industrial sector. One of our large Duke Energy Carolinas customers in the metals industry is reorganizing and plans to begin returning to full operations in 2018. And some other industrial customers saw similar pullbacks from operations, would expect to ramp up as we go forward. Looking ahead, we continue to expect approximately 0.5% load growth in our long-term planning assumptions.","Several factors give us confidence that this assumption remains true. We are experiencing consistently strong customer growth, especially in our Carolinas and Florida regions given a recent uptick in construction in our service areas and greater housing permit applications. We've also seen a recent shift away from starts of multifamily homes to single-family homes. This shift is highlighted by the fact that four major cities within our service territories recently ranked among the top 16 in the country, with a number of single-family building permits filed. Two of these metro areas ranked in the top 5.","The decline in the government sector has leveled out a bit, and we are cautiously optimistic about increased business investment in manufacturing, as inventory levels have declined from previously elevated levels. Based on current and expected economic trends, we're also optimistic about potential for the industrial sector to pick up in the next few years. These positive factors will be partially offset by the continued adoption of more efficient building codes and standards and utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs.","While these programs do offset some of our customer growth, they also contribute to earnings through our approved energy efficiency riders. Overall, we believe all of these factors will allow us to achieve 0.5% load growth during our planning horizon.","Regarding cost control, we have held O&M flat since 2014, and we'll look to continue that trend going forward, creating headroom and customer bills for important energy and infrastructure investments.","2016, we reduced our O&M costs even with unusually high storm costs compared to the prior year, and after re-planning O&M activities on behalf of our customers to take advantage of the above-normal weather. We committed to reducing our O&M cost in 2016, and we clearly delivered on that commitment. We have outlined our economic growth plan and significant capital investments that we will make over the next five years.","Now, let me take a few minutes on slide 19 to discuss our plans for cost recovery, as we balance our growing business and maintaining competitive rates for our customers. We will be very active in the regulatory space over the next five years. As we have done in the past, we will continue to work constructively with key stakeholders to achieve results that benefit our customers and shareholders, while managing our cost to keep bill increases at a moderate level and overall rates below the national average.","Investments we have planned will drive economic growth in our desirable service areas and support additional customers and new technologies. As you can see, we will file two base rate cases with the North Carolina Utilities Commission in 2017; one for our Duke Energy Carolinas utility and the other for Duke Energy Progress. Both North Carolina cases are scheduled to be filed in the summer of 2017, anticipating new rates effective in the first half of 2018.","These filings will be the first in North Carolina in four years to recover costs associated with our capital investments and more efficient generation such as the Lee combined cycle facility, nuclear projects, and coal ash basin closure activities. Looking beyond 2017, we're making substantial investments in the grid. As we look to accelerate those investments over the next five years, we will be engaged in the regulatory and legislative process to pursue recovery mechanisms such as multi-year rate plans and trackers which are better suited to grid infrastructure.","As these regulatory modernization initiatives move forward, we will also evaluate more frequent base rate cases in the interim to ensure timely recovery and more moderate rate impacts to our customers. Updated constructs would avoid the need for filing numerous larger rate cases and level out the rate impact to our customers.","Turning to Florida, we are also planning additional transmission investment and additional renewable projects, as we look to 2019 and beyond. The regulatory construct in the state of Florida, which includes generation-based rate adjustments, solar-based rate adjustments and multi-year rate plans, is well-suited to our investment plan. We will continue to make significant investments in the transmission and distribution systems in Indiana and Ohio, with timely recovery of the investments through previously approved riders.","As we turn to our gas segment on slide 20, we have outlined the five-year $6 billion growth capital plan to expand our national gas infrastructure and further develop this platform. Our plans are split evenly between investments in our LDCs and our midstream gas pipelines. This business will grow rapidly, driven by an earnings-based CAGR of 11% over the next five years as part of our larger 10-year plan to grow this business to 15% of earnings.","Growth in this segment will come from strong organic growth opportunities in our LDCs and midstream investments. We expect to deploy approximately $3 billion in our gas LDC systems, with Piedmont accounting for more than two-thirds of our LDC earnings base, and the Midwest accounting for the remaining third. Our LDCs will continue to invest in infrastructure for our growing customer base, as well as integrity management programs that maintain the safety of our system. These integrity investments are recovered efficiently through well-established riders in several of our jurisdictions.","Moving to our midstream investments, we plan to invest an additional $3 billion in our pipelines during the five-year period, much of which will contribute to the completion of ACP. This project is now anticipated to cost between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, and is still expected to meet the second-half 2019 in-service date. We look forward to growing this platform as we expand our natural gas infrastructure and leverage the expertise of our Piedmont team.","Turning to slide 21, I have already mentioned our $1.3 billion investment in regulated renewables. In addition, we will also invest $1 billion in commercial renewable assets. This expands upon the more than $5 billion we have already invested in our contracted commercial renewables business since 2007, focusing on entering long-term power purchase agreements with creditworthy counterparties. Our Commercial Renewables business continue to expand its wind and solar portfolio, ending the year with nearly 3,000 megawatts in 14 states.","These commercial investments, plus our growing regulated renewables footprint, have positioned us as a top 5 renewables company in the country, and our plan will continue to advance that position. And we do not currently pay significant cash taxes. Due to our corporate net operating loss tax position, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital deployment in our commercial business, focusing on projects that meet our return criteria. Given the more attractive tax credit profile from the Production Tax Credit or PTC, we will explore wind projects more aggressively than solar in this segment.","In 2016, we invested in approximately 1,000 megawatts of new wind projects that qualify for the 10-year PTC under Safe Harbor rules. This gives us flexibility to bid on RFPs over the next several years. Historically, we have not employed tax equity to finance our renewables projects. Given that we have had more efficient and less costly options, we are always seeking the most cost-effective means to develop and finance these projects, and we'll continue to evaluate other capital sources including tax equity structures when appropriate.","Strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Slide 22 shows our high level 2017 cash flows and financing plan. With our portfolio transition complete, we have a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We are supporting the balance sheet with $350 million of DRIP equity per year from 2018 to 2021, which will advance our efforts to fund the increasing level of growth investments in our business.","We expect the frequent rate case activity and equity through our internal plans to strengthen our financial metrics over the five-year plan. I would also like to highlight S&P's recent affirmation of our ratings and revision of our outlook from negative to stable. This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and confidence the rating agency has in our ability to execute on our commitments.","Before I turn it back over to Lynn for closing remarks, let me turn to slide 23. We understand the value of the dividend to our shareholders and are committed to growing the dividend responsibly. We have paid a dividend for 91 consecutive years, demonstrating the steadfast commitment to our shareholders. Moving forward, we expect to maintain our annual dividend growth rate at approximately 4% to 6% through 2021, as we target a payout ratio in the 70% to 75% range.","With that, I will turn it back over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Steve, thanks, and thanks to all of you who've joined the call today. We are excited about the future and remain confident in our ability to deliver strong growth and financial results. We have an ambitious and achievable strategy focused on investing in the grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure, all while modernizing our cost recovery mechanisms and providing customers with the service they value.","As this slide shows, we bring many advantages to this conversation, including scale, constructive jurisdictions, a track record of execution and importantly, we are unencumbered by the challenges that we have successfully put behind us.","In conclusion, our vision for where we want to take Duke Energy is clear and compelling. Our strategy to achieve the vision is well underway. We have the right plan and are working to plan. It is producing results and we entered 2017 with confidence. We're well-positioned to deliver value for customers and steady growth, strong yields and an attractive risk-adjusted total shareholder return for our investors. That is a compelling investor proposition, representing a solid, long-term holding for our shareholders.","Foundational to this proposition is the strength of our dividend and with an adjusted earnings growth plan of 4% to 6%, we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow the dividend. Over the long term, the combination of these factors has the potential to generate 8% to 10% total shareholder return to our investors.","Now, let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for all the details and the update. It's very helpful. I just have a question on the financing and the split between HoldCo and utility and project financing this year. It looks like it's a little over 40% HoldCo. Is that on a net basis? Is that something we should anticipate going forward? Do you stick with that structure, or is HoldCo a little up above where the trend will be?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I don't know that it's necessarily going to be a trend. It'll be related to timing of maturities and other investments. So I don't think that there's any trend in that, Jonathan.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Jonathan, our target, as we've laid out on the credit metrics slide, is to have low-30% overall HoldCo debt to total. So that's the long-term trend you should be thinking about.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I guess that was the thrust of my question that it seems in 2017, you obviously \u2013 you'll be moving away from the target, and then it only comes down a little bit by 2021. So, how should we think about the 34% is \u2013 within \u2013 do you consider that to be in the target range or is it more sort of backend of the decade that you can \u2013 you get further back down towards it?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, as Lynn said, our target is in the low-30%s, and we're a bit above that as we work through this transition of our portfolio. But we'll be looking to move the HoldCo debt into our target range. And we're making progress to our five-year plan. And we'll continue to strive to get it to that point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then if I may just on tax, what gives you confidence that the sort of downside scenario under the House GOP is that interest deduction would only apply on new debt?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, this is a fluid situation, as you know. And we've looked at a variety of scenarios. We thought presenting the new HoldCo debt would give you a sense of where the exposure is. We recognize we do have downside exposure under the GOP plan. As this continues to develop and legislation is introduced and we learn more specifics, of course, we'll update that. But we thought it was a reasonable planning assumption to share with you at this point based on our understanding of how things are developing.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But if we wanted to think about what the implications of losing it on the embedded \u2013 the existing debt, I would take the $557 million of HoldCo 2017 interest plus the $87 million in commercial renewables and eliminate the 20% assumed tax shield....","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","...I'll give you a \u2013 yeah, I'll give you a quick one. It's closer to 7%.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. So, I'll let someone else go. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Stephen.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thought that was a very thorough and thoughtful update on your strategy and growth outlook. Let me just follow up on Jonathan on tax reform which I imagine is a popular topic. When you look at potential levers, I'm thinking first about the potential loss or the potential immediate expensing of CapEx. You obviously have a lot of growth levers at your disposal. How would you think about potentially changing your spending profile to the extent that, that actually got enacted that you immediately expense CapEx?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, if you move in that direction with the immediate expensing of CapEx, one thing I'd say, we're currently in an NOL position throughout the majority of our five-year planning horizon. So, the immediate expensing to CapEx would deepen that NOL position at the backend of our plan. So it's not a significant rate base change for us during the five-year plan. Broadly speaking, I would say, as you heard from our capital planning as a whole, we have a lot of investment opportunities as we rebuild the grid and decarbonize and produce cleaner energy. And those opportunities I think will carry us for quite a while.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you. And then, just shifting over to solar and energy storage and grid modernization, I think you're pretty clear in your plans. But let's assume that cost for solar continue to fall and storage continue to fall. Later in the decade, is there a potential for accelerating spending there? How do you think about solar and storage for your \u2013 I'm really thinking for your regulated territories in terms of the potential for additional spending there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Stephen, I think that is a developing area that we continue to pursue. I think you're aware we have an RFP out now for 400 megawatts in the Carolina, the western part of the state, and we're also in discussions around our avoided cost filing which could provide a pathway for additional solar.","We believe there is a wealth of investment opportunities, and putting forward $1.3 billion, we're targeting a substantial investment, but I could see scenarios in which it can go higher. Our objective is to own some amount of the solar in the state of North Carolina and Florida and our other service territories, and we're working to move in that direction.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And on storage, Lynn, is there a role for storage any time soon, or is it really just premature given the fairly low penetration of renewable energy in your territories?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","It's modest, Stephen, over the next five years. We do have probably a half a dozen to a dozen sites that are under development where we have batteries in place on our system ranging in size from small residential, all the way up to a 35-megawatt battery paired with a wind farm in West Texas. As we look at this planning horizon, we do have some battery megawatts in our plan, but we see it as being a greater contributor, 2021 to 2025, than we do over the next five years.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. All right. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","In your \u2013 I think in your early prepared remarks, you mentioned something about potentially being at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth rate over time. Could you just give \u2013 I missed the intro of that, could you repeat that and just what would you need to see to kind of be looking more at the high end?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Steve, what I talked about is, it's really successful execution of this plan which includes ramping up investments such as the grid investment in the Carolinas, coupled with timely recovery gives us greater confidence at the higher end of the range. So we feel like we've got a plan that gives us that potential, and our assignment is to execute it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And I guess \u2013 I mean, one thing might be just getting maybe through resolution of somebody's rate cases to get better visibility on those?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We have rate cases filed this year. I think better visibility might present to you how we have addressed rate cases for historical investments. Steve, I think it's important to recognize that we have a demonstrated track record of successful execution of regulatory outcomes. If you look at what we have accomplished around our jurisdictions, whether it's related in Florida, the new generation, Crystal River and Levy in Indiana, rate cases in the Carolinas, we have confidence that we can find the right balance between customers and investors and putting capital to work in our jurisdictions in a constructive way. So we come at this with a plan that we believe we can execute.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just \u2013 should we assume the earned ROEs that you're kind of assuming in 2017 for the different states, or is that roughly kind of the range for the five-year plan?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think that's a reasonable assumption.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one other question just on the coal ash. In the 2017 guidance, what are you assuming on how that is treated, just to continue deferral at a debt return, on equity return or...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, for GAAP purposes, Steve, there will be \u2013 we only record a debt return on...","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","...on coal ash.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","It'll be a debt return. We'll continue to defer up until the point of commission order.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And we will request coal ash recovery in the upcoming cases here in 2017.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. How are you doing?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just to follow up on Steve's question a little bit, so are you saying that the successful execution of the plan gets you to the higher end or the upper end of the range, and that even if there were some problems, you would still be at the midpoint? Is that a good way of looking at it?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, we've put together a plan exactly, Michael, that if we successfully execute, will position us at the higher end of the range.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And in terms of the \u2013 can you discuss like the impact of the NOL position on the renewable growth plans? Because I remember it is a little bit slower now, and it sounds like you're going to be more focused on wind going forward. How is that being impacted by the NOL position? And also what's the status of the 500-megawatt plan for Florida solar?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. Regarding our NOL position and how it's impacting our commercial renewables, we've talked about this a bit in the past. We've been in an NOL position for a while, and under current rules, we're projecting to come out of that in 2020. And that affects the timing of the ability to monetize the various tax credits that these projects generate.","In spite of that, we've been able to land projects and bring them in very efficiently and economically. As we move \u2013 what we've seen over the past years is that it's a competitive landscape with some narrowing margins there. We've still been able to put in service 500 megawatts of commercial renewables in 2016.","So as we look forward, what we wanted to do is give an indication here that recognizing our NOL position. We will look at tax equity. Partnership arrangements is a possible financing tool. We've looked at that in the past, we haven't found anything that was acceptable, and we found other options that were more beneficial to us. But we will be open and continue to examine those possibilities.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, a couple of additional things I would point to. As we get toward the end of the decade, we are planning at this point to be out of an NOL position, now that's setting aside tax reform which could of course change the landscape. So, we believe we'll become increasingly competitive as we enter the latter part of the decade under current tax law.","And the other thing I would point to, consistent with your question on Florida, is that we have directed more capital in this plan to regulated renewables, $1.3 billion in the Carolinas and Florida, which we believe will be underpinned by increasing economics, improving economics of those investments in those states. And we will look for ways we can add that form of renewable which has a better return profile for our investors.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And also just one last question on taxes, I don't think you made any comments on the border-adjusted tax and how that might affect your operations at all?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Michael, we do have some exposure to border-adjusted tax within our regulated businesses. I'd point to \u2013 our nuclear fleet is being impacted with fuel and so on. I think what's important is to recognize that our nuclear fleet is regulated that this would become a part of our cost of service. And we are \u2013 of course, as we advocate around impacts to customer rates, the benefits of low cost energy and other items, we are pointing this out in our advocacy plan to our key legislators, is important to Duke Energy and Duke Energy customers.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. That's great. Thank you very much. And by the way, the presentation looks great. The new slides look very well done, so...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","...congratulations on doing that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. You touched on a couple things around the rate cases that you're going to file for in North Carolina this year, but I wanted to try to get some more detail there. And if we think over the last kind of four years, what has changed since the last filings and decisions there? I'm wondering how we can think about that. You've had some load growth. You definitely had rate base growth, but a big chunk of that is deferred with the coal ash expenses. So, are we kind of looking at you guys pretty much earning your authorized ROE right now and the main benefit of these cases being just a cash recovery on coal ash?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Chris, I would point to a couple of things. I think the other variable \u2013 and what has happened over the last four years is, we have executed very effectively on cost management, which gives us some headroom in order to put capital investment in and recovery in without raising prices in a significant way for our customers, and that's very important as we enter in a rate case.","We do have capital investment. We intend to recover nuclearly combined cycle. We have deferred costs in the form of Hurricane Matthew, and, of course, we have recovery of ash. So it will be a mix of cash recovery and returns. And as we get closer to filing, of course, we'll give you more specifics on what we're filing for and the composition, and you can expect that later this year.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my next question is on your capital plan for the next five years. You already talked about commercial renewable growth in there. But are there any placeholders that we should be aware of for kind of large lumpy projects that are not yet approved or kind of maybe even aspirational on the pipeline side or things of that nature for pipelines or other?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","No, we do have growth capital in the plan, Chris, and I would think of it in kind of the $500 million range over this five-year period. And we typically maintain some level of growth capital if you look at us historically because you think about five years, there's time to develop, and we want to put those aspirations out there. So there is some growth capital, kind of $500 million to $700 million, in the gas plan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But nothing kind of particularly large that would move things year-to-year if you were not successful in getting them.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And Praful Mehta with Citi, your question next, please.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And, yes, the slides do look great, so I appreciate it.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had a quick question on holding company debt and tax reforms. I want to just quickly come back to that. If the interest deductibility does go away, do you plan to change the target holding company level that you want to have in terms of debt? And if you do, what are the level do you have in your tool kit right now to think about how you'll reduce that level over time?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think \u2013 let me start, and I'm sure Steve has some thoughts on this as well. I think as we think about tax reform, we turn the discussion to the holding company because of the impact. But I think as you face tax reform, you also have to look at what's happening to the underlying earnings power of the utilities and what options we have there. And that would be a part of the decision process on how we would address the holding company. Certainly, delevering could be something we would consider, but I think there's a lot of work to do before we would reach a conclusion like that.","And so as this develops, we will continue to keep you informed. And we understand the assignment of mitigating impact to the extent we can, and that's one of the benefits of looking at scenarios that is underway right now.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you. And then on the utility side, the growth profile you provided was very helpful through 2021. But if we have to look at retail customer rates, and I know there was a slide you provided with rates in 2017, but just to get a sense, well, what kind of load growth you're looking at over that timeframe, and how do you think rates would go or increase over that timeframe to get a sense for sustainability of that growth over time?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, we focus very keenly on customer rate impact. And you'll have more visibility on specifics as we think about the plans in 2017 as we announce these rate cases. But over a longer term, we target kind of rate of inflation for \u2013 CAGR for customer rate. So, that might be in the range of 2% to 3.5% depending on the jurisdiction. And we actually use that as a governor when we think about capital deployment and our cost of service because of the importance of keeping competitive rates. I think you recognize that we operate in a very competitive environment where our rates in the Carolinas in particular are 20% below national average, and that is an advantage to our service territories if we can continue to perform in that way.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","And we've seen rate reductions due to fuel over the past several years to our customers. So that's part of the overall picture as well.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. So if there is, in fact, tax reform that reduces customer bills just because of newer tax rates, does that mean you have more headroom to spend more CapEx during that timeframe?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. In general, if income taxes are lower like any other operational expense, that provides an opportunity for a utility to make further investments in infrastructure under the same rate scheme. So those can be beneficial situations that we have taken advantage of in the past.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. I guess following up on Praful's earlier questions related to debt. On the HoldCo debt, does the 5% dilutive comment on the House plan, does that incorporate expected changes to the HoldCo debt structure or is that just holding the HoldCo debt outlook in your plan constant and then you could react to it later to mitigate that 5% dilutions?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","It's a modeled level of HoldCo debt in our five-year plan, also considering cash flow impact that we can see in a very preliminary way from the utilities up to the parent. And so that's about a 5% dilutive, Brian.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Got you. Okay, great. And then one other thing, the grid modernization CapEx update is pretty helpful here. What proportion of the grid modernization spending is subject to legislative approval? I think based on the last couple of conversations I've had with you, there were some legislation in the Carolinas, for example, that was necessary for some of that spending, can you just give a little bit of color on that?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","There's nothing subject to legislative approval, Brian. We believe the compelling customer value for this is quite strong. And so we have been discussing the importance of infrastructure growth in our jurisdictions, Carolinas, in both the regulatory and legislative level to inform them of the opportunity that exist here and the value we think we can deliver. We also see it as an economic development driver in our service territories. As we set out a long-term plan where workforce could be developed to work in areas that are rural areas of the state, we think there's a compelling business case for the leaders of the state.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Appreciate the clarification. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start to the year.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I have a question, just \u2013 I'm looking at the detail you provide in slide 18, and you show the adjusted book ROEs by state. And then you talk about O&M cost to management and the need to file rate cases in North Carolina. And I'm \u2013 I'm just \u2013 I'm a little confused only because you're kind of expecting on a 10% to 10.5% or so ROE in the Carolinas. And you're also managing O&M in the Carolinas as one of your bigger jurisdictions. So just curious what drives the need for a case, especially in a state that typically uses historical test years?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, Michael. We've got a number of things occurring here. We've been deferring a lot of costs on our balance sheet that we need to start getting some recovery on. Coal ash is certainly one of those items. We've spent about $900 million on coal ash to-date. We requested and have deferred Hurricane Matthew cost to the tune of about $150 million as well.","So, we'll be seeking recovery in some form or fashion of those types of costs. Additionally, we have had infrastructure buildup. Nuclear uprates and the Lee combined-cycle plant are two good examples there that we'll be incorporating into rates.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. But wouldn't those things be weighing on \u2013 right, if they're already in service, you would have lost the AFUDC. Wouldn't they be weighing on the earned returns? And yet it seems like you're doing a great job of actually earning your ROEs there.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We have been. To the extent you make capital investments and put them into plant and service, they will weigh on the earned returns. But that's where we have worked very diligently to control our O&M cost, to expand our wholesale sales, to keep our regulated ROEs up. But now, as we move forward, it's time to catch up that rate base growth. And also, we do have the singular Lee combined-cycle plant as an example that will be timed with rate recovery, which will be moving from CWIP to in-service. So there's a number of factors, as we've mentioned earlier, some deferred cost cash recoveries and some earnings uplift potentials as well, a mix of the two.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And last thing, just thinking about the O&M cost management. You're saying a 5% reduction and I'm still on that kind of same slide, page 18. Is that a 5% reduction on the total kind of GAAP level of $6.2 billion, or a 5% reduction on that smaller number, the $4.6 billion or $4.7 billion?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","It's on the non-recoverable O&M number. The smaller number there. The larger number has recoverables and pass-through type items, as well as some cost-to-achieve type items. So, we're looking at the non-recoverable, lower number.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you, Lynn. Thanks, Steve.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Much appreciated.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go to [Robert Tsong] with SunTrust.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Robert.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Just a really quick question on the 4% to 6% across the five years. Should we think about it linear across the five years or is it more frontend or back-end loaded?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","No, as we said in our prepared remarks, we have designed this plan to deliver within the range every year, both the capital and the recovery mechanisms.","Unknown Speaker","I see. Okay. And that's all I have. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to [Hassan Jahan with Avila Research Consulting].","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hey.","Unknown Speaker","Couple of questions on the tax issue. One, Steve, I thought what you said was very interesting. If the corporate tax rate goes down, it sounds like you were suggesting that you get to keep that benefit and then take that money and reinvest it in new infrastructure. Is that kind of right or I would've thought that the rates would be reduced to compensate for the lower tax rates?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, not necessarily. There's a number of options that can be put forth here as we work with the various stakeholders. But we've had cost, O&M items drop in the past. There's a number of things that can be done.","You can reinvest in capital and keep your ROEs the same under the current rates, but advance your infrastructure for customers. You can use situations like this to accelerate amortizations of regulatory assets and things of that nature when an O&M cost declines and keep current rates where they're at. We've done that in the past, so there's a number of strategic opportunities that exist out there.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And I think the important point...","Unknown Speaker","Excellent.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","...is if customer rates are otherwise going down for a reduction in tax rates, that gives you the opportunity to deploy capital without an increase in .","Unknown Speaker","Right. Right.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So that's the point we're trying to emphasize here.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's excellent. Gas LDC, M&A, is that something that is still in the mix?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So this plan does not contemplate M&A. We feel like with the portfolio of businesses that we have that we've got a good growth trajectory. Asset acquisitions, if we saw something that fit with one of the businesses, we of course would be opportunistic. But there's no, what I would call, corporate M&A contemplated here.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Personal tax rates going down, I would assume if that happens, your 4% to 6% growth rate would start to look very low, correct?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","If personal tax rates go down?","Unknown Speaker","More money to the consumer, consumers spend more, more household formations, therefore more electric connections and gas connections, no?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We love load growth. We do.","Unknown Speaker","Exactly.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's probably the best thing that can happen to our business.","Unknown Speaker","Exactly.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So let's move to the Southeast. Let's build industrial in the Midwest, we're all for it.","Unknown Speaker","But first the tax rate has to come down.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","But to the extent the economy picks up based on various tax initiatives, whether corporate or personal and discretionary spending increases, well, that will certainly help our business. And certainly our Southeast jurisdictions are very desirable areas with a lot of growth. We'd love to see that uptick.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And last question, if you're going to Washington to influence the outcome of the tax results, why not push for deduction of dividends?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's interesting question because we have that raised by a legislator actually in an early conversation. So, all things are on the table, I guess.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your attention during a slightly longer call and set of prepared remarks.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's first quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials.","Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on key regulatory activity and progress we've made advancing our strategic investment plan. Steve will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and insight about economic and low growth trends. He will then provide an update on tax reform and our financing plan before closing with key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.28, marking a strong start to 2018. It's clear our long-term strategy is delivering results. We made progress on our strategic investments and regulatory initiatives and continue to expand our electric and gas infrastructure businesses with solid customer and volume growth across our service areas. With these results, we remain on track to deliver our 2018 EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share and our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022.","In response to tax reform and consistent with the plans we shared with you in February, we successfully executed a $1.6 billion equity offering in March. We also remain on track for the additional steps that we outlined, reducing capital by $1 billion over the five-year plan and maintaining a sharp focus on operational cost efficiency. Overall, I'm confident we have the right approach to financing our investments. And S&P reaffirmed our credit ratings and stable outlook in March.","On this slide, we've also highlighted other notable accomplishments during the quarter that demonstrate the dedication of our employees and their focus on delivering affordable, safe, reliable, and increasingly clean energy. This was recognized by EEI [Edison Electric Institute], which ranked Duke Energy number one in safety in the industry for the third year in a row. And on May 1, Forbes honored our commitment to engaging, developing, and retaining our workforce, naming Duke Energy as a top employer.","Turning to slide 5, let me provide an update on our regulatory activities during the quarter. Last year we filed two rate cases, one for Duke Energy Progress and one for Duke Energy Carolinas. In late February, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order in our DEP case, approving new rates associated with our $8.1 billion rate base, including our investments in four new solar projects and gas-fired generation at Sutton and Asheville. The decision approved a 9.9% ROE on a 52% equity component of the capital structure.","The order also clarified coal ash cost recovery. We received approval to amortize $234 million out of a requested $240 million in deferred costs over a five-year period and with a full debt and equity return. Ongoing coal ash costs will be deferred with a return and be considered in the next DEP rate case.","Hearings in DEC ended in March, and in late April we filed a post-hearing brief reiterating our positions in the case. We used the opportunity to introduce a modified proposal of a grid rider for the commission's consideration. We also addressed our views regarding tax reform. We proposed reducing customer rates, accounting for the lower federal income tax rate, and returning unprotected access deferred income taxes to customers over 5 to 20 years. The timeline is dependent upon the nature of the items that created the deferral. Finally, we requested to offset a portion of the revenue decrease with the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerated depreciation, or recovery of environmental expenditures.","We believe our proposals included in the post-hearing brief strike an appropriate balance of delivering value to customers while providing returns to investors and maintaining the strength of the utility's balance sheet. A decision is expected in late May or early June.","In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in April, which addresses both the electric distribution rate case and our pending ESP proceeding. It includes the extension of our distribution capital investment rider through 2025, giving us clear line of sight for recovery of our investments. The rider is subject to increasing revenue caps through 2025. In addition, the settlement establishes a new PowerForward rider to recover costs to enhance the customer experience and further transform the grid, including investments as a result of the Ohio Commission's own PowerForward initiative.","Also in April, we received a positive order from the Kentucky Public Service Commission in our electric base rate case. It established a new rider to recover environmental expenditures, including those related to coal ash.","We have made clear progress achieving constructive regulatory outcomes, including modernizing our regulatory constructs. We continue to demonstrate our ability to work with stakeholders to achieve balanced solutions that benefit customers and support our growth plan.","Moving to slide 6, I want to provide an update on our efforts to transform the way we generate energy. With three new natural gas plants either online or under construction, we're committed to reducing our carbon footprint and leveraging the overlap between our electric and gas businesses.","Our W.S. Lee plant, located in South Carolina, began serving customers on April 5, with our Piedmont subsidiary delivering gas using new infrastructure put in place for the project. In Florida, we expect Citrus County to begin operations soon, with Unit 1 online in the fall and unit 2 by the end of the year. This plant, totaling 1,600 megawatts, will allow us to retire two coal-fired units at Crystal River.","In April, we filed a request with the Florida Public Service Commission to recover our investment in Citrus County via the GBRA mechanism once the units are placed in service. Our filing included an increase to the revenue requirement of approximately $200 million per year. New rates are expected to be fully updated in the fourth quarter.","Our Western Carolinas modernization project is progressing and remains on track for an expected 2019 in-service date.","We're also investing in our Commercial Renewables business. We anticipate our 25-megawatt Shoreham solar facility to come online in the second quarter, one of the largest solar projects in New York. This is our first project in New York and expands our Commercial Renewables footprint to 14 states. We put tax equity financing in place for this project and will continue to use this funding source moving forward.","In addition to these clean energy projects, we recently issued two key reports, our annual Sustainability Report and our Climate Report. The Climate Report outline steps we're taking to mitigate risks from climate change and includes analysis of a 2-degree scenario. Importantly, our current plan to achieve a 40% carbon reduction by 2030 is consistent with the pathway to achieving this 2-degree scenario. This new report is another example of our longstanding commitment to the environment and our stakeholders.","Moving to slide 7, let me update you on our natural gas business. We made significant progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter, completing approximately 200 miles of tree-felling along the 600-mile route, or approximately 75% of the miles planned for 2018. The remaining miles will be addressed later this fall when the tree-felling window opens again.","In April, we received FERC approval to begin full construction on the Northampton Compressor Station in North Carolina. This marks the second of three compressor stations for which we have full construction approval, representing another meaningful step for the project.","We also requested approval from FERC to start full construction on the West Virginia portion of the pipeline, where tree-felling has been completed or was not required. While we await the final state permits in Virginia, these milestones keep the project on track for a fourth quarter 2019 in-service date.","Turning to Sabal Trail, the lateral line to our Citrus County natural gas plant is in service, allowing us to begin operational testing prior to bringing the plant online to serve customers. FERC reissued the certificate for Sabal Trail, reaffirming that the project will not result in a significant impact on the environment. Recently, the project partners successfully completed the permanent financing, raising approximately $1.5 billion to return capital to the project owners now that construction is complete. Duke's share of the proceeds is approximately $100 million.","Finally, one quick note on the recent FERC NOPR regarding tax reform, Duke Energy's midstream investments in ACP and Sabal Trial are over 90% contracted with negotiated rates and 20 to 25-year contracts. We believe the proposed rulemaking does not impact our projects.","As I turn it over to Steve, our results for this quarter show that the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are well-positioned as we move ahead in 2018. Our industry continues to transform, requiring us to execute, anticipate, and adapt. That remains our focus, as we invest in infrastructure our customers' value and deliver sustainable growth for our investors. We're delivering on our strategy and I remain confident in our vision to be the leading energy infrastructure company.","So, Steve, let me turn it to you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn.","Let's start with quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide 8 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior-year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.","On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 first quarter earnings per share were $0.88 compared to $1.02 last year. First quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28 compared to $1.04 in the prior year. The most significant drivers of the difference between reported and adjusted earnings in the quarter were charges related to the sale of the retired Beckjord plant in Ohio; the recognition of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act; charges related to the DEP rate order; and an impairment of Duke Energy's investment in the Constitution Pipeline.","Higher adjusted results in the quarter were principally due to weather, as well as growth in our electric and gas businesses. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure results were up $0.26 compared to the prior year. Weather was the primary driver with a $0.16 increase, as we returned to more normal weather in the first quarter compared to the warmer winter weather a year ago. We also had higher retail revenues from pricing and riders, primarily driven by three factors; generation base rate or GBRA increases in Florida that took effect last year related to our Hines and Osprey facilities; grid riders in the Midwest; and the recovery of qualifying facility power purchases through the fuel rider in North Carolina as a result of HB 589.","We also saw higher retail electric volumes in the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. O&M was favorable $0.04 in the quarter, but this favorability is expected to reverse in future quarters. Finally, the Electric segment benefited from lower income tax expense of $0.06, including impacts of the Tax Act. A portion of this benefit is related to tax levelization and is expected to reverse later this year, as excess deferred income taxes are reflected in customer rates. Higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset the positive drivers, primarily due to growth in the asset base.","Shifting to our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, results were up $0.03 for the quarter. The increase was largely driven by customer growth and increased investments at Piedmont, including higher rate base from integrity management investments and required infrastructure for our W.S. Lee plant. This is another example of the complementary nature of our electric and gas businesses.","In Commercial Renewables, we were down $0.01 for the quarter. This was driven by lower wind resources compared to last year.","Finally, Other was down $0.04 due to higher interest expense at the holding company and higher income tax expense, including a lower tax shield on HoldCo interest as a result of the Tax Act. The lower tax shield and other impacts on the new law across our business segments, including the timing of these impacts, are consistent with our full-year 2018 planning assumptions. Overall, we had a very solid start to the year and look forward to delivering on our plan in the coming quarters.","Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load growth was 0.6%, consistent with our long-term planning assumption of 0.5%. The residential class exhibited particular strength, growing 1.9% on a rolling 12-month basis. Importantly, load grew faster than the number of customers this quarter, indicating usage growth per customer. We see this as a positive economic indicator and will continue to closely track customer usage trends. Population growth remains strong in our service territories, especially in Florida and North Carolina, which were ranked among the top five states for population gains in 2017.","We were also encouraged to see strength in the Cincinnati metro area, and Nashville remains one of the fastest growing cities in the country. As we look ahead, positive trends in employment and wages and continued strength in the housing market are expected to drive ongoing residential growth. Residential building permit activity remains high, especially in the single-family category.","In the commercial class, sales across our jurisdictions were slightly down over the rolling 12 months. We continue to see some weakness in large retailers as they compete with online offerings. Yet, strength in leisure and hospitality businesses have offset this to some degree. Small business confidence remains high, providing optimism for future growth in this sector.","Turning to industrials, on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector declined 0.5%. This decrease is primarily due to production declines at a couple of large customers in the middle of last year and recent outage activities. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continue to perform well, which partially offsets the decline. On a macro level, positive economic growth is a tailwind, with leading economic indicators remaining high.","Overall, we remain confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth in our electric utilities and continue to be optimistic for the economic prospects within our service territories.","Shifting to slide 10, we are making progress in addressing tax reform across our jurisdictions. As we said in February, our approach is to target solutions that provide benefits to customers while smoothing customer rate volatility and supporting the credit quality of the utilities. In several of our jurisdictions, we have proposed using a portion of the lower tax expense to accelerate depreciation, recover environmental costs, or amortize regulatory assets. Our solution at Duke Energy Florida is a great example of this. Earlier this year, we received commission approval to use tax reform benefits to offset Hurricane Irma costs and accelerate the depreciation of older coal-fired generation units.","Elsewhere, revenues recovered via riders will be updated for the lower federal income tax rate as the rider filings are made in the ordinary course. The remaining portions of the tax law, including the treatment of excess deferred income taxes, are being addressed in separate tax reform dockets or in base rate case proceedings. In DEC North Carolina, we expect the commission to address tax reform in our pending rate case and look forward to the commission's decision in the coming weeks. For DEP North Carolina, we recommended addressing tax reform in the next rate case proceedings.","Our proposals and rate outcomes today on tax reform are consistent with the objectives we outlined on our fourth quarter call. We will continue to respond to our state regulators and other stakeholders in the coming months as these proceedings progress.","Next, let me take a moment on slide 11 to discuss the strength of our balance sheet. As Lynn mentioned, in early March we successfully executed a $1.6 billion equity offering, which included a full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters. We also issued $50 million of equity via the DRIP in the first quarter. We will issue the remaining $350 million for 2018 using both the DRIP and our ATM program. Recall that beyond 2018, we intend to continue issuing $350 million of equity per year for the remainder of the five-year plan.","We remain on track to achieve our FFO-to-debt target by 2020. In addition to the equity issuances, our cash flow profile and credit quality are further supported by our regulatory modernization efforts and an active regulatory calendar. This cash flow support includes recovery of deferred coal ash costs, which we are now recovering from our DEP North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as well as our wholesale customers.","I would also like to remind folks of the material cash flow benefit related to our $1.1 billion of AMT credits that are now refundable under the Tax Act. Beginning in 2019, the value of these credits will be refunded to the company regardless of whether or not we have taxable income. The legislation front-loads the refund schedule, with 50% of the unused credits refundable each year. This has a significant positive effect on our funds from operations over the refund period.","We've also included in our appendix more information on the FFO-to-debt metric, including the implications of coal ash spend, Crystal River 3 securitization, and the effects of purchase accounting. We share these adjustments and the logic behind them with the rating agencies on a regular basis. S&P took a constructive view of the credit quality of the company in March, affirming Duke Energy's current ratings and keeping the company on a stable outlook. In its report, the agency noted two items as credit positive, the commission's approval of coal ash recovery in the DEP rate case order and our commitment to issue equity, including $2 billion of equity in 2018.","Going forward, the agencies will look for continued constructive regulatory outcomes and execution of our long-term plan. We believe a strong balance sheet is necessary to invest on behalf of our customers and investors, and we have taken an important steps to support our credit quality. We remain confident in our equity financing plan. It is sufficient to support the strength of the balance sheet and our growth investments, and we do not expect to issue additional equity over the remaining $350 million per year in the five-year plan.","Before I close, I want to take a moment to remind you of our long-term earnings growth guidance, as shown on slide 12. Our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022 is based off of $4.60 per share in 2017, the midpoint of our original 2017 guidance. While the midpoint of this year's guidance range is below this growth rate, we expect to be back to the low end of the 4% to 6% CAGR by next year. As our higher rate base growth and regulatory recovery accumulates, we expect to be at the mid to high end of the range in 2020 and beyond.","I'll close with our investor value proposition on slide 13. We continue to offer an attractive 8% to 10% shareholder return that balances the 4% to 6% earnings growth with a strong and growing dividend. Our growth is driven by low-risk regulated investments that are supported by our strong balance sheet. Our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses position Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll first go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Steve, you may have given more on this than I picked up in the remarks, so I apologize if that's the case. But I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color into the benefits of tax reform that are retained in the Utilities and Infrastructure segment this quarter, perhaps quantify how much that was, how it's arising, and then to what extent you expect it to be an incremental benefit during the rest of the year.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","What we saw in the quarter looking AVA [Average Value Analysis], we saw $0.06 favorability related to income taxes. A couple of things are going on there. I mentioned the accounting levelization rules require smoothing of tax benefits over the year, and that accounts for $0.02 or $0.03 of that favorability. We also utilized some tax optimization efforts that helped provide some benefits in income tax as well. But there is the levelization that will turn around to the extent I described.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And, Jonathan, maybe just to add to that, the overall guidance that we provided in February for the impact of tax reform, we are on track for that. What you're seeing is just some quarter-to-quarter levelization resulting from the application of GAAP, but we are on track with the guidance we gave you in February.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so that incorporates some earnings pickup from the fact that the riders won't be implemented till they get implemented and the DEP happening in the next case. Am I my understanding that right?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The cash flow implications of retaining those benefits would be reflected in the results. We are deferring in every jurisdiction, I believe, Steve, tax benefits. So you can think about it as cash flow financing benefit, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so what you're calling out as an earnings driver is purely the timing. It's not the cash benefit.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's right. What is an earnings driver here is the levelization primarily that Lynn described. There have been some tax optimization efforts that are in the results. That's separate from the Tax Act issue.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you for that. And just one other topic, can you give us an update of how you feel about your goals that you've laid out in Commercial Renewables and just the state of the market competitive-wise there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, we're on track in 2018 in the Commercial Renewables segment. The variance that you see in the quarter is more weather-related, but the backlog of projects and what we expect to close in 2018 remains on track. As you know, it's a competitive market, and we expect it to continue to be.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","All right. Next we'll go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Quick question, the 15% to 16% FFO-to-debt target for 2020 to 2022 and 14% for 2018, how much would that be impacted if \u2013 how much of that is dependent on the outcome of the DEP case? How could it change positive or negative as a result of the outcome?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, I think the DEP case was very constructive. I think it's overall in line with our expectations as a whole...","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'm sorry, but the DEC case.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Okay. We've modeled a number of scenario outcomes. The DEC case we'll learn about in a few weeks, but I think we have a number of levers to pull to still meet our credit metrics over our plan.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, if you look at the DEP case, a very constructive outcome addressing all of the capital, substantially all of the deferred coal ash. We believe we put on a very strong case for DEC, and we'll know more on the specifics late May or June, but I think the precedent established in the DEP case is how you should think about DEC.","And then tax reform would be the addition to DEC that I would point to, and we were specific in our recommendations around tax reform in our post-hearing brief that we filed at the end of April. Our intent has always been that customers should see the benefit of the reduction in rates from 35% to 21%, and we have proposed an amortization period for the unprotected, which we think strikes a good balance.","So as Steve said, we always model a variety of scenarios on these things, but feel like we're on track to deliver those metrics, and we're certainly committed to do that. And if at any point there's a timing or shortfall, we do have levers, as Steve indicated, to make sure we remain on track.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just to follow up on that, the real question is, the current equity issuance of $2 billion target for this year, does that incorporate even your worst-case scenarios for the outcome of the case, or is there a possibility there might be more?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, it does.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I think the thing I would think about on tax reform, which is really probably the most significant open item because we don't yet have commission approval, it comes down to the treatment of the unprotected deferred taxes. And so we're not talking about a wide degree of variability for a company of our size. And we're talking about amortization periods ranging from 5 years to 20 years that we proposed. So I think it's important to bound that uncertainty exposure as you think about our confidence.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you, but you've bounded \u2013 possible outcomes on the unprotected tax refunds are built into that equity issuance plan, right?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Absolutely.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Good morning, Lynn.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So just first, do you have any sense from Moody's on when they might revisit the negative outlook given the equity issuance you did and the like?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Steve, we can't project with certainty what Moody's timing is. The one thing I would point to though is that their report earlier this year and your outlook action was really centered around tax reform. So I would expect as we move through the resolution of the DEC case, you'll get a clear picture of North Carolina. We already have Florida dialed in. Kentucky is visible, and we have dockets open in both Ohio and Indiana. So I feel like more information is going to become available over the next several months around tax reform in our larger jurisdictions, and we'll certainly be anxious to share all of that with Moody's.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then the $1.1 billion of refundable AMT credits, so in 2019 and 2020, are you just essentially getting tax money, essentially refunds from the government on taxes?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, that's correct.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Overall, because you also have your NOL and other...","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We're getting that as cash.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just technically the $1.1 billion, that's a direct number. That's not like a \u2013 do we tax effect that, or is that a direct?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's a direct number. That's (32:01).","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Direct cash, okay. Okay, thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Steve.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","All right.","Operator","And next we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, if we can go to the modernization side of the equation, starting with Ohio, PowerForward, obviously that's success on that front. Does that change your CapEx at all? Obviously, it wouldn't be too meaningful. And then secondly, related to that, can you talk on the outcome of the latest rate cases in the Carolinas and to what extent that might shift things?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So we're pleased with the result of the settlement in Ohio, Julien, but we need to get through a commission process. So there are hearings in July, but feel good about the settlement we were able to bring to the table. I think the PowerForward part of that rider will include projects that will impact customer experience, so our replacement of customer systems will be included in there. But we'd also expect the Ohio Commission, as they continue their work on their initiatives, to perhaps identify some things that we could invest in. Those would be incremental to our plan. So overall, I would look at the result \u2013 the settlement in Ohio as being consistent with our plan with modest upside.","And in the Carolinas, I think we talked a number of times about grid investment being a priority in the Carolinas. We'll be watching closely the results of the DEC case and then determining our strategy for legislation in 2019 and beyond to see if there's additional legislative certainty that we need to provide in order to set a pathway for further investment in the Carolinas. So that's what I would share with you about modernization in the Carolinas.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then turning back to the overall guidance, not to wordsmith things too much, but I just wanted to understand what you're saying about 2019 guidance. Last time, I think you guys talked about being \"within the guidance range by 2019.\" And I think this go around, you talk about being back to the lower end of the 4% to 6%. Is that something to do with the timing of the equity and within the plan, or am I just being too nitpicky here?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Julien, the message has been the same. If you go back and reference where we were in February, it has always been low end of the range in 2019 and then mid-to-high in 2020 and beyond as we see the rate base growth and the investment and so on. So no change in message, but we'll be at the low end of the range in 2019.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Sorry, just quick nitpicky thing on the tax side real quickly. Obviously Ohio, that issue I think got pushed out from the settlement conversations. What's the latest expectation on resolving that?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","There's a docket in Ohio. I'd expect it to move through a process in 2018, Julien, but I don't have anything more specific than that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent, thank you all very much, best of luck.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","All right, next we'll go to Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First, Steve, I wanted to just make sure I had heard something earlier when you talked about first quarter and some timing-related issues. One was tax levelization, as you clarified. If I heard you right as well, I think you mentioned there was about a $0.04 pickup in O&M, also timing related that would reverse over the course of the year. Did I hear that right?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, that's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We've seen some favorable O&M in the first quarter, but some of that was related to timing of purchases and so forth, so that may turn around.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then secondly, when I look at the rate base data that you've given us through 2022, at least just looking at that data, it appears that the growth in rate base actually slows down 2020 and beyond. So I'm just wondering how to reconcile that with the point that earnings growth should actually accelerate 2020 and beyond. So how do we reconcile those two things?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, I would first think about 2020 as being the completion of a number of important projects that we'll begin to see impact and then fuller impact. So ACP, Western Carolina, the step-in in Florida, the riders in Ohio and Indiana, environmental spend in Indiana. And then as you get further out in the period, we will continue to drive investment in our strategic priority areas of grid, clean energy, gas, and renewables. And those plans will be more fine-tuned as time progresses. What we've given you is ranges and expectations, but we will fine-tune the numbers in 2021 and 2022 as we get closer.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And last question, Lynn, remind us also. When is the next big rate case cycle that we should think about once you're done with the North Carolina cases now over this planning period?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So as I think about jurisdictions, we're set in Florida if the settlement is improved. Ohio is in good shape. We just finished a case in Kentucky. We have a number of trackers in Indiana. We continue to think about is it time to come in for a full case, so that's something that will be under evaluation.","And then the Carolinas, we'll be anxious to see the results of the DEC case, and that will inform our timing. But as we've talked about a number of times, we believe the investment profile in the Carolinas matched with great value and benefits to customers is a good one. We're looking for ways we can modernize the construct. And in the interim, we'll be filing cases to deliver returns to investors and match those benefits to customers. So we'll have more specifics though on the timing after we digest the DEC case.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Now we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you for...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Lynn. Thank you guys for taking my call \u2013 my question. I actually have a couple. The first one is can you quantify under tax reform and the tax law changes at a companywide level for your regulated operating companies? And I'm just looking for the total company level, not by subsidiary. What is the excess or unprotected add\/fit (38:43), that balance? What do you estimate that to be, that likely over multiple, multiple years will likely get refunded back to customers?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We've got about $6.3 billion of excess deferreds on our books, Michael, total company. And of that, about $4.5 billion is protected, and unprotected is about $1.8 billion.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So the $4.5 billion should qualify under normalization like we saw after the 1986 Tax Act and go back to customers over a long life period, and the other staff, it's more negotiable?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. The other thing, and this is more of a regulatory or rate-making question. When you look at your capital spend forecast over the next couple years, how much of that \u2013 is there a rule of thumb of how much of that capital spend is covered via trackers or riders versus covered via traditional historical looking rate case processes?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","It will vary per jurisdiction, Michael. Certainly, we have a number of trackers in the Midwest that cover a lot of the capital there. We got the multiyear rate planning in Florida that provides us very efficient recovery. The Carolinas, the larger jurisdiction which has a lot of the CapEx, has fewer trackers at this point in time. So it's hard to give a rule of thumb there for the enterprise as a whole.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, in the Carolinas, as you know, modernizing has been a priority. So if you think about HB 589, we now do have tracking mechanisms in the Carolinas around renewables, and we've put in front of the commission grid tracking. So our objective over the five-year period is to make progress in the Carolinas. But I think if you look at the Midwest and Florida, substantial, over 50%, 60%, 70% perhaps are covered by trackers in those jurisdictions.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you, Lynn. And thank you, Steve, much appreciated.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Praful Mehta with Citi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, Steve, just to clarify \u2013 and by the way, slide 23 is very helpful in terms of the deferred taxes. But just to clarify, on that $1.8 billion of unprotected, what amount do we have clarity right now of the five years, and what amount is uncertain in terms of the timing of the refund? And the reason for the question, just to give you the context, is I was just trying to figure out where in that FFO-to-debt range can your metrics vary depending on the outcome of the deferred income taxes.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure. Of the $1.8 billion of unprotected excess deferreds, about $1.1 billion is at DEC and about $300 million is at Duke Energy Progress, so the bulk of it is in the Carolinas. The remaining portions are in Indiana and Florida. So the big piece of that is in the Carolinas.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And I think, Praful, as you think about this DEC case, we'll get some visibility into the unprotected for DEC within the next couple months. And we've put forward a proposal of amortization between 5 and 20 years, tying that amortization period to the asset class, the nature of the items that resulted in the deferred taxes. And as I've said a moment ago, we'll learn more from the commission as we see the results in the DEC rate case.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, fair enough. That makes sense. But just so if there is pushback or a request for faster refunds than what you have currently assumed, I guess, in your metrics, your FFO-to-debt metrics, does that put pressure on credit at all, or do you think most scenarios that you can get back in terms of the rate case or the settlement are kind of incorporated within your current plan?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, we're confident on this. If you think about $1.1 billion over a 5 year or 10-year period and the scale of the company, the amount of capital we spend, the regulatory activity that we have to generate cash flow, we feel like we have scenarios and levers that we can exercise and manage variability. So I'd leave it at that. Steve?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Right, I would echo that as well. We have efforts under capital optimization looking at our O&M spend that can help offset this, just a number of levers to pull.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, fair enough. That's helpful. And then secondly on tax equity, I saw that with one of your solar projects, you're looking at tax equity financing, and you mentioned this will be a bigger part going forward. It sounds like it makes sense given your cash tax profile. How attractive is the tax equity market right now? How big a player do you look to be in that tax equity? I'm assuming that is a part of your FFO-to-debt strategy as well to improve metrics. So just a little bit of color around that would be helpful.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure, the tax equity market is still very viable. It is in fact being used at our Shoreham facility, our solar farm in New York, and we'll continue to utilize that. As you mentioned, our tax position puts us as a candidate for that. And I think the markets there, it is an important part of our Commercial Renewables profile. So we'll utilize that as we go forward.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, the capital that we laid out with you in February is still a good planning assumption for Commercial Renewables. We just look at tax equity as a tool we'll use to put that capital to work.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, fair enough. Thanks so much, guys, I appreciate it.","Lynn J.

My question is...","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Lynn, my questions were just answered. Thanks so much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","All right, thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","All right.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Bye, guys.","Operator","Okay. We'll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","At renewables, you were down $0.01, which you attributed to wind resource. Was that a net number? In other words, did you have growth from incremental projects more than offset by more than $0.01 of core wind resource?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, that's a net number.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Assuming wind resource had been flat, what would the segment have done?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I'd have to look at that a little bit further, Paul. But the results were down $0.01, and that's primarily due to wind resource and there's some additional resources, but it's not significant.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And then back to Steve's question, the $1.1 billion of AMTs, so what net number will you be receiving from the IRS next year? Do you expect the full $550 million?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, in the range of that amount, 50% of the $1.1 billion, we'll get that next year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that's net of what you'll be paying the IRS. In other words, you'll be not a cash taxpayer?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's the amount from the AMT, and we're not a cash taxpayer on any other front. And the AMT...","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","...is not tied to taxable income in any way. It's just an amount you get regardless of where you're at on your tax return.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Lynn and Steve.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate the extra detail on Atlantic Coast. That was very helpful. Thank you for that, just a couple clarifications. Could you maybe give us a little bit more on how you're feeling in North Carolina about the grid mod rider? Staff didn't like it but did admit that they would prefer that it has a cost cap and some other conditions if they did approve it. So how are you feeling there, and how much does the tax benefits to the customers in general kind of weigh in on commission and intervener thinking there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So on the grid investment, Chris, I think what we saw in the hearing is just a continuation of a good discussion about the nature of the investments, the benefits they can deliver, the impact on customer bills. And so as we put together our post-hearing brief, we really addressed a number of the issues that were expressed during the hearing process and put in front of the commission what I would call kind of a step-in for the rider, a three-year proposal with a cap that was responsive to the feedback that we received.","So I would think about this as being a continuation of our strategy to keep the conversation going about the grid. I actually think there's a very little disagreement about the need for the investment. I think the benefits to customers are clear, and we are trying to find the right way to put that investment in place for the benefit of customers in a way that makes sense to the commission, public staff, et cetera.","I think tax reform represents a great opportunity because you have an opportunity to reduce impact to customers, at the same time you're driving investment. So I think they're complementary in that regard. And so we look forward to continuing the dialogue. And as we've shared previously, we have thought about the grid investment and modernization as being dual-track. Focusing on the regulatory process certainly, but also having legislation is something that we would also consider as we continue our work to modernize regulation.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. I think we'll have to wait and see there. And then just two tax clarification questions, when do you expect to become a cash taxpayer again? And I guess that question would exclude any noise from the AMT credit you're getting the next two years.","And then the second question is just on the South Carolina approval from the commission on tax reform there. Do you pay a return to customers on the deferred balance?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","On the first question, we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer in our five-year plan, so it's after 2022 when that happens. And help me on your second question again on South Carolina.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you guys just got the okay a couple weeks back to defer taxes and not have it addressed by the commission until your next rate case filings there.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the interim, do you pay a return on that deferred tax liability owed to customers?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","No, we're just deferring those costs at this point.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Then the commission will determine how to deal with that at that time of the proceeding. We're just deferring those benefits right now.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's good to hear. Thank you, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","All right, thanks, Chris.","Operator","And it looks like we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to turn it back over to Ms. Lynn Good, for any closing remarks.","Lynn J.

Please go ahead.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, April. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","Before turning the call over to Lynn, I would like to give you an update on staffing for the Duke Energy IR team. After over two years with the team, Charlie Tapp will be shortly assuming new responsibilities within the Duke Energy organization. Therefore, this will be his last earnings call. I am very excited for Charlie, as this is a fantastic career move for him. Many of you have work closely with him over the past few years, and I hope you will join me in congratulating him on this fantastic move.","With that, I will turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, we reported 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.54 per share in line with the year ago. I'm pleased with the solid performance and operational execution of our core regulated businesses despite record mild December weather. These results largely offset challenges throughout the year in our International operation. As a sign of confidence in the future, our board, last year, doubled the growth rate of the dividend, a key component of our investor value proposition.","During today's call, we have several objectives. First, I will highlight how we are strategically positioning the business portfolio and investing for the long term. Then I will discuss our 2015 operational highlights, including our industry-leading safety and environmental performance. Steve will provide a financial update, with our outlook for 2016 and beyond.","Turning to slide four, I'll begin with a broader discussion of our strategy, which provides an important context for the five-year financial plan that Steve will cover. Our industry is undergoing transformation with new technology, evolving customer expectations, increasingly impactful public policies and abundant low-cost natural gas. These factors will have a profound impact on our business in the years ahead and are enforming our strategic investments.","We are focusing our long-term strategy on our core domestic, regulated businesses and our highly-contracted Renewables portfolio. We will invest an increasing amount in the electric grid, to strengthen reliability and resilience and enable new customer solutions. To advance reliable, cost-effective power and a lower-carbon future, we will invest in natural gas generation and infrastructure, as well as build on our rapid expansion and renewable technologies. We will also invest to maintain our valuable nuclear and clean coal assets.","We enter this period of industry transformation with a strong regulated business, and we've demonstrated strength and operational excellence, sustainable cost management and regulatory execution. These capabilities will continue to underpin our success in the years ahead.","An important part of this strategic focus is our decision outlined on slide five to engage advisors and pursue and an orderly exit of our Latin American generation business. This business has been an important part of the Duke Energy portfolio over many years, providing both earnings and cash flows. However, the returns over the last two years are inconsistent with our commitment to investors to provide predictable, stable earnings and cash flows.","We believe there will be demand for this international portfolio at a reasonable valuation. Because we are early in the process, it is premature to establish a specific timeline for a potential transaction. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and help fund the growth in our core businesses. We expect that a sale will be dilutive. Nonetheless, the strategic exit significantly improves our risk profile and enhances our ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time.","On slide six, I will update on our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This investment is also an important element of our focus on natural gas infrastructure and customer solutions. Piedmont is a regulated natural gas infrastructure and local distribution company in the Carolinas and Tennessee. It operates gas infrastructure that supports our gas-fired generation in the Carolinas and provides valuable natural gas solutions to customers. We are obtaining a high-quality asset with an excellent management team, exceptional customer service and strong rate base growth prospects. Piedmont's highly-regulated gas businesses and constructive regulatory jurisdictions fit well with our strategic direction. We expect that the transaction will be accretive in 2017 with the level of accretion growing over time through incremental capital investments and integration of Piedmont operations.","We've made good progress in obtaining the required approval. The Federal Trade Commission has graded early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, and Piedmont shareholders have approved the transaction. We are awaiting approvals from the North Carolina and Tennessee Utilities Commission. We are still targeting to close the transaction by the end of this year, and in the meantime, merger integration efforts are well underway, so that we are ready to hit the ground running immediately after the close.","As outlined on slide seven, you can see the series of strategic transactions that we have made since 2012 to realign our business portfolio to drive more stable earnings and cash flows. The exit in International and acquisition of Piedmont will complete the transition. This repositioning provides an outstanding foundation for growth and investment for the remainder of this decade and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me highlight on slide eight several important operational achievements in our progress, advancing our strategic investments during 2015. I'm proud of the 28,000 Duke Energy employees who are here day in and day out for our customers. Our customers count on us to provide safe, reliable, environmentally responsible energy every day.","We completed 2015 with an industry-leading safety record, significantly reducing OSHA recordable incidents and our total incident case rate. Our work is never complete on this front, but I'm pleased with the focus and alignment throughout the organization on safe, event-free operations.","We also significantly reduced the number of reportable environmental events in 2015. We have taken what we've learned from the Dan River spill in early 2014 and applied it throughout our organization to strengthen operational discipline and results. We have also built world-class capabilities to accelerate the safe closure of our ash basins and are on track to continue advancing the support and work in 2016. Likewise, our Edwardsport IGCC facility in Indiana continues to improve its operational performance, delivering the third consecutive year of improved output and gas supplier availability.","We also made great progress on a number of our strategic growth initiatives during the year. As mentioned and consistent with our strategy, we are modernizing the electric grid and modernizing the generation portfolio, including investing in natural gas and utility-scale solar.","During 2015, we completed the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency asset acquisition, which strengthens our generation portfolio in the Carolinas. We also announced plans for the Western Carolinas modernization project, which adds new natural gas and solar generation. We made updated filings for grid modernization in Indiana and continue to advance utility-scale solar investments in the Carolinas and Florida.","In our Commercial Portfolio, we continue to grow our Renewables business throughout the U.S. In fact, we installed around 600 megawatts of new wind and solar assets in 2015, surpassing our original objective. Our natural gas pipeline investments will supply our customers with low-cost fuel and provide supply diversity, while delivering great returns for investors. The Sabal Trail pipeline received FERC approval earlier this month, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline made its formal FERC filing late last year.","In closing, strategic investments that provide value to customers underpinned by excellent operations will deliver stable and predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our shareholders for years to come.","Now, let me turn the call over to Steve.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses.","We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from three years to five years through 2020 to better align with our capital forecast or expected rate case activities and the completion of our portfolio transition.","I'll begin on slide nine. In 2015, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings of $4.54 per share, slightly below our full year guidance range. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by very mild weather. In fact, weather in the month of December impacted our results by $0.12 as temperatures in the Carolinas averaged around 10 degrees above normal.","For the full year, strength in our core businesses, our regulated utilities and our Commercial Portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure, as well as early execution on a number of strategic initiatives, helped us offset weakness in our International business. Our core businesses delivered $4.15 per share on a weather-normal basis, representing an average annual 5.5% growth rate from our base year of 2013. And our International business delivered $0.33 per share. For more detailed information on our financial performance in 2015, please refer to the supporting materials that accompanied today's press release.","Our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range, which we are introducing today is $4.50 to $4.70 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes a contribution of $4.30 per share from the core businesses, which represent 4% growth over 2015. The midpoint also assumes $0.30 from International, which is down slightly from 2015.","Let me walk you through the key drivers in our businesses from 2015 to 2016. Within the regulated utilities year-over-year weather-normal growth will be primarily driven by the deployment of almost $5 billion in growth capital. Retail load growth of 0.5%, the full year impact of our recent acquisition of the NCEMPA assets, as well as lower O&M costs. Lower O&M reflects our confidence in continuing to drive cost out of our business. I will review this further in a moment.","Within our Commercial Portfolio, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in Renewables, and our pipeline joint ventures. Additionally, we realized a full year of benefit from the prior-year accelerated stock repurchase. These growth drivers are partially offset by regulatory lag in certain jurisdictions, as we will not have any significant base rate increases in 2016. The loss of earnings from the Midwest generation business, which was sold in 2015, will also be a partial offset.","At International, we expect 2016 earnings of $0.30 per share. In Brazil reservoir levels have improved during the rainy season, which runs through April. As a result, we are assuming a return to normal dispatch of the hydro generation in Brazil after the rainy season, lowering our purchase power costs. This improvement in the Brazilian hydro operations is expected to be offset by the declining Brazilian exchange rates and low Brent crude oil prices, which impact National Methanol's level of profitability.","Let's shift to discuss the components of our long-term growth. With the pending exit of International, we believe the appropriate focus for our long-term growth discussion should be centered around our core businesses. Through 2020, our core businesses are well-situated to grow within 4% to 6% off of their 2016 base of $4.30 per share.","On slide 10, we have developed a base plan that will deliver 4% to 5% growth. We have also defined incremental growth opportunities that, if achieved, will deliver toward the higher end of the range, or 5% to 6% growth. Our base plan is largely driven by the deployment of between $22 billion and $25 billion of growth capital in our regulated utilities and between $3 billion to $5 billion in commercial renewables in our gas pipeline investments.","This base plan also assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of 0.5% per year from 2016 to 2020, consistent with the past several years. As a reminder, every 50 basis point improvement in retail load growth provides about 1% earnings per share growth. In order to accommodate modest organic retail sales growth, we are targeting flat O&M cost through 2020. And, as you know, our track record in cost management has been very good.","To achieve the high end of our long-term growth rate, or 5% to 6%, there are incremental growth opportunities that provide upside potential. They include retail load growth higher than our base plan assumption of 0.5%, supported by strengthening economic conditions in our service territories. More on that in a moment.","The acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, is additive to our growth rate as we move forward. Other growth opportunities exist in our wholesale business, in the form of new contracts. In addition, we also have opportunities to deploy more discretionary growth capital than what we have assumed in our base plan. Those investment opportunities include additional commercial and regulated renewables, further modernization of the generation fleet and additional gas infrastructure investments.","Turning now to slide 11. I'll discuss in more detail our regulated investments over the next five years. The combination of these investments supports the growth rate in our regulated earnings base of approximately 5% from 2016 through 2020. Our capital deployment is directed to the strategic priorities that Lynn discussed: customer focus grid investments, new gas and renewable generation investments and natural gas infrastructure, as demand for gas increases.","We expect to invest nearly $8 billion expanding our regulated electric grid infrastructure, including improvements in technology. These investments will enable us to improve the reliability of the grid, reduce outages and restore service faster, and provide real-time information to our customers. We also plan to invest around $8 billion in new generation, including natural gas and renewable assets, as we continue to build an energy system for the future and reduce emissions even further, while maintaining the service reliability our customers expect.","Finally, we expect investments of $3 billion for environmental compliance. This amount covers steam effluent requirements and cost to close the initial high-priority coal ash basins in the Carolinas.","Our earnings growth from 2016 to 2020 is strong, but not linear, due to the timing of capital deployment and subsequent rate recovery. We see earnings growth accelerating in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe, due to several factors.","First, grid and customer investments in Ohio and Indiana build over time and are recovered through rate riders later in the five-year period. Second, our investments in new generation in Florida and the Carolinas, as well as our gas pipeline infrastructures projects, will begin to accelerate in 2018 through 2020. Third, we will be filing a number of rate cases in this time period across many of our utilities in order to recover our capital investments. We expect to file a rate case in Duke Energy Ohio in 2016 and Duke Energy Kentucky in 2017.","We also expect cases in the Carolinas in the back half of our five-year plan. We continue to fine tune specific timing based on our capital spending projects, such as the Lee Combined Cycle, the Western Carolinas Modernization Project, and coal ash basin remediation. We have further details of our capital spend and recovering mechanisms by category of investment in our appendix materials.","Moving ahead to slide 12. I'll discuss some trends we're monitoring related to our retail load. We are planning for modest growth of 0.5% over the next five years. However, there are a few developing trends that give us optimism for some upside over the coming years. The labor market continues to strengthen, with unemployment and median household incomes improving. Jobs are being created in our service territories, as the Carolinas and Florida were among the top 10 in job growth in 2015.","We continue to forecast strong growth in the number of customers, particularly, in the Carolinas and Florida. Additionally, usage per customer which declined during 2013 and 2014 has been essentially flat for the past three consecutive quarters. Certain sectors of the industrial class, such as construction and automotive, remains strong, while the strengthening U.S. dollar has challenged other sectors, such as the steel industry.","The strength of our service territories is also supported by robust economic development activities, attracting new businesses and jobs. In 2015, these activities led to the announcement of $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 12,000 new jobs in our six-state service area.","As we are planning for a period of sustained modest low growth, it is important that we efficiently manage our cost structure. As outlined on slide 13, we've been successful holding costs down in the past and are targeting to keep our non-fuel O&M costs flat through 2020. The Progress Energy merger integration initiatives focused heavily on the consolidation and optimization of our corporate centers. We made significant investments integrating our IT, HR and financial systems to common platforms. We are now rolling out similar initiatives to the operational parts of the organization in order to achieve our target of flat O&M through 2020.","Slide 14, shows a our high-level 2016 cash flows and financing plan. As I mentioned in my opening, our strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Our focus on the core businesses creates a better risk profile, with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We design our financing plans and target credit metrics with those objectives in mind. Our five-year plan includes $700 million of DRIP equity after 2017, designed to bolster the balance sheet to continue funding the increasing level of growth investments we expect in the back end of the planning horizon, such as the Atlantic Coast pipeline and new gas generation.","Our financing assumptions outlined on this slide do not include the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas or the sale of International. We plan to issue between $500 million to $750 million of equity through a forward structure and will finance the remainder with debt at the holding company upon closing. Proceeds from the sale of international will be used to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to fund growth in our core businesses.","Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the recent five-year extension of bonus depreciation benefits. This extension will generate cumulative after-tax cash benefits of about $3 billion. However, due to our federal net operating loss tax position, we will see total improved cash flows of around $1 billion, but in the back end of our planning horizon. In the short-term, our federal tax position will keep us from recognizing the manufacturing deduction through 2018, impacting our annual earnings by around $0.05 per share.","Moving to slide 15, let's talk about our dividend. We have probably paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive years. Last year, our board approved a 4% increase to the dividend, which was double the previous annual growth rate of around 2%. We continue to target annual growth and the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our dividend is supported by the strong cash flows from our core businesses.","Our regulated utilities are distributing between 65% and 70% of their earnings to the parent during the planning horizon, providing strong support to the dividend. Additionally, during the period, we continue to hold the International business. This segment will generate annual cash flows of between $200 million and $300 million to be distributed to the parent. Through 2020, our dividend payout ratio is expected to be between 70% and 75%. We are comfortable with the payout, given the quality of our lower risk core businesses and their more stable earnings and cash flows.","I'll close with slide 16, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. We are confident in our ability to grow our core businesses between 4% and 6% through 2020. We will also maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure reliable access to the capital markets, while we finance this growth.","With that, let me turn it back over to Lynn for some closing thoughts.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","So, thank you, Steve. Before we take your questions, I just want to underscore a few points that are summarized on slide 17. We are strategically responding to the transformation that is occurring in our industry. We're simplifying our business portfolio to focus on our growing core regulated businesses and our highly-contacted Renewables portfolio. We're enhancing customer value by investing in the grid to improve reliability and the customer experience, while also investing in new natural gas and renewable generation resources, as we prepare the business for a lower carbon future.","We operate in strong jurisdictions that are positioned for customer growth over the coming years. Our efficient cost structure, coupled with low natural gas prices allows us to make significant investments, while maintaining very competitive rates for customers.","Taken together, the predictable stable earnings and cash flows that we are positioned to generate will support attractive earnings and dividend growth for our investors in the years to come.","Now, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Operator : Thank you. And, we'll first hear from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning, Shahriar.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Thanks for the additional color on the LatAm assets. Lynn, in your prepared remarks, you kind of highlighted some dilution. So, when we're thinking about net proceeds and the cash you still have left to repatriate, I think it's about $1.5 billion. Should we offset this from a sale amount? So, do you kind of lose these cash flows in a pending sale, or is this cash that sitting in an account that's at your disposal which is additive to evaluation?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Shahriar, we think about it as acceleration of the amount planned for repatriation. You may recall when we set forth the dividend, it was over a seven-year period,, and it basically represented cash flow that would be generated over that period. So, we've harvested about $1.5 billion, we have $1.2 billion to go, and you can think of part of the proceeds as being acceleration of that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Excellent. And then, just for the proceeds, should we think a little bit more de-levering or potentially lower equity needs?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","As we look at everything that we've laid out here, Shahriar, the proceeds from International will go a couple of places. One bank to accelerate that repatriation that I just talked about. Those cash flows are already in the plan, we're just brining them forward. And then we will use the rest of the proceeds to fund the growth. So, as we laid out the combination of DRIP equity, whether we take to finance, Piedmont, the growth capital that's in the plan, proceeds of International are part of that financing picture over the five-year period.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Got it. And then just lastly, really big jump in renewables for the placeholders. Is that sort of extension of the tax credits, or what's driving that?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","We have been investing kind of in the range of $500 million to $1 billion for some time, Shahriar, and look to continue that. I think the extension of the credits creates opportunities to do it, but we will continue to be opportunistic if we find projects that may (27:29) return expectations, we'll continue to invest.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And that's right. And I would add, our placeholder is about $500 million per year, and we've been able to find investments at that level for the past several years.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Dan.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Hi, Dan.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just \u2013 I mean, Steve, if you can go back to the bonus appreciation conversation a little bit and maybe kind of layout when you see those cash flows actually affecting rate base, it seems like the timing will differ when you affect rate base, and we'll have much bearing on when you file the Carolinas cases, as they come towards the back end of the decade?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, let me give a little background on the bonus here. We would expect, Dan, to get about $7 billion of additional deductions from this extension, that translates to maybe $2.73 billion of reduced taxes, but only $1 billion of that's going to be within our planning horizon. We are currently in an NOL position. We weren't expecting to be significant tax payers until 2018, so all that shifts out by two years or three years there. So, it's backend loaded for us looking at the corporate level.","So, as we plan rate cases in the back half of this period, we don't see huge impacts necessarily on those filings there. Now, I will say that every utility has its own standalone NOL computation and structure, so there may be some effect on some of these filings in different jurisdictions, as we do the standalone filings. But we have, again, not a dramatic impact, because we're already in this NOL position.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So we shouldn't think of the bonuses having a substantive effect on kind of the rate of growth that you've had before or as of today?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Not during this period through 2020. I don't think it is substantive. The biggest impact on earnings, as we said earlier, is the loss of the manufacturers' deduction of about $0.05 a year through 2018.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess anything about getting the International proceeds back in? What are the opportunities when you kind of look at the list of things you could do that look most compelling as to redeployment of that capital? Is there transmission spending, is there infrastructure spend? Where do you think you can ramp up and reuse that cash?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Dan, in looking at what we've laid out, we think discretionary spending opportunities against \u2013 exist throughout our portfolio, whether it's additional grid investment, whether it's additional renewables conversions of our coal fleet to natural gas, transmission is a part of it. But our transmission build has been slow and coming. We have the pioneer project under construction, but we continue to be in development mode there.","So, I would look at the discretionary capital as opportunities that exist throughout our portfolio. I would add gas infrastructure to that, perhaps I didn't emphasize that, but gas infrastructure around the Piedmont acquisition and further expansion of the pipelines.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I guess one last question is on the dividend. If you look where the dividend's going to be in 2016, against kind of the $4.30 baseline earnings, it kind of puts that payout ratio maybe a bit higher than even the targeted range. How do we think about the growth rate beyond this point, post International sale?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","We move the growth rate up to 4%, Dan, as you know this year. And the dividend is extraordinarily important. Our commitment to investors to continue to grow it remains unchanged. As we look at this transition in the portfolio, what we're moving to is a lower risk, more predictable, more stable set of earnings and cash flows, which we believe gives us confidence in allowing that payout ratio to trend up slightly. And then over time, if we execute on this plan, as we are committed to doing so, that payout ratio will turn down over time. So, we are confident, looking at this, that we have a growing dividend offering to our investors.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So you're good at the 4%, even with International sale?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yes.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to think through the tax shield that you might be able to deploy in terms of proceeds, if you were to sell assets in Latin America. Obviously, you'll have to pay, I guess, local taxes upon repatriating the money, but could you speak a little bit further, I know you talked about your tax position somewhat, but in terms of how we should think about the ability to shield proceeds from taxation when you bring the money back to the United States?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Stephen, tax implications depend upon the sales price and so forth, and I can't get into any of that, but the \u2013 so, we'll be taxable, and we have stripped out basis in the past with our International assets. So, there could be a lower tax basis that could result in a gain. Again, our NOL positioning at our corporate level provides a delay in timing of cash taxes, though, that is useful to us.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","And I think, Stephen, you can think of that NOL position as, in effect, sheltering the timing of the payment of the cash gain on that sale.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, I see. So, as you burn through the NOL over time, then that can reverse itself, but initially, it provides quite a bit of potential benefit in shielding some of those proceeds.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","That's right.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, absolutely.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just shifting over big picture to the Clean Power Plan. There's certainly been lots of interesting developments in that regard. At a high level, I'd love any commentary you'd be willing to provide in terms of how you think about potential implications for your planning, in terms of additional spending opportunities, feedback at the state level? Any further color on the Clean Power Plan would be great.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Sure, Stephen, and I know that's a top-of-mind question for many, because it's such a recent development. And I would describe Duke's position on this as one of continuing to work toward modernizing our fleet. If you look back at our track record of the last five years, we have been consistently moving toward lower carbon sources of generation, and we see that continuing. So as I look at this five-year plan, whether this would stay a Clean Power Plan or not, we believe the plan that we're on is one that makes sense for customers, and our communities, and our states.","I think the clarity that'll come from this legal review will be helpful, but more helpful to set pace and timing of decisions in the next decade, so in the 2020s and forward. So I would say our states are still grappling with this, understanding it, thinking through their processes. We will be closely working with them. We're trying to find solutions that make the most sense for our customers and communities. But I think for the near term, the strategy will be to watch the litigation and then execute the plan that we already have in front of us in terms of modernizing our system.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you.","Operator : And then next, we'll hear from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Jonathan, how are you?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm good. Thank you. Just quick question. From your answers, I think that it's fairly clear you're contemplating a sale of International, but you use the word exit, which obviously could include other scenarios, like a local listing perhaps. Are we definitely talking about a sale, and are you highly confident that that's an achievable outcome?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","We are talking about a sale, Jonathan. And, I would confirm that we have been working and evaluating options for some time. I think we began providing some visibility to the Street, in the second quarter and third quarter, about some of the things we saw with the International business.","We believe we have very high-quality valuable assets. The asset in Brazil is a hydro asset in Sao Paulo. And we believe prospective buyers will share the view of the value of these assets, and we're confident that we can execute. And, at this point, because the process is early, however, we can't give specifics on timing or valuation, but we'll continue to provide updates in the quarters that follow.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, on the slide on financing, I think it says that the baseline, it's not assuming proceeds. But, just to be clear, would you \u2013 does your $700 million of DRIP, would you still expect to be doing that in the event that you do sell International, or does that actually assume a sale?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","As I look at this \u2013 kind of the whole complexion of this, Jonathan, the $700 million is really tied to accelerated capital spending in that period, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the gas generation assets, and more infrastructure that we think will be necessary in those periods.","We have not had the DRIP on since 2010. And we believe, with the level of capital spending in our core businesses, that that is an important approach. The proceeds for International, you should think about as being an acceleration of repatriation, and that repatriation was already in the plan. And that we believe the remaining amount would be appropriate for delevering, because the International business has provided a source of FFO in our metrics \u2013 our credit metrics. And so, as we take those out, we believe it's important for us to delever in connection with the rest of those proceeds.","So, if you look at the whole thing together, we believe we can execute the capital that's included the acquisition of Piedmont, the divestiture of International and have a very strong balance sheet and growth rate coming out of that five-year period.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Lynn. And just sort of related topic, you talked about wanting to hold investment grade, and you're still on negative outlook, a couple of the agencies, do the \u2013 does this plan, do you think this plan keeps your ratings where they are? Or would you be \u2013 are you okay with seeing them slide another notch?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","We believe, we've put together a plan that is consistent with our ratings, Jonathan. I can't step into the shoes of the rating agencies, though, with certainty, but we will keep them informed along the way of our plans. Certainly, the Piedmont acquisition, they have been informed of. We'll share our capital plans, we'll share our commitment to equity, and we'll share our progress in the International business. But we are targeting to maintain our ratings, as they are today and believe we can execute this plan consistent with those ratings.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's it. Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me, Lynn?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Hi, Steve. Yes.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Good morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the question of kind of thinking about an International sale. Is there a way to give us a sense of debt that might be kind of allocated to International and also maybe corporate costs that's allocated to International, as we're trying to analyze this?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Steve, we have in-country debt, that I suspect about $700 million....","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","$700 million of in-country debt.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","And as you look at the segment of International, I would think of that as being a pretty standalone segment. One of the things we were trying to accomplish with the delineation of earnings here in the base period, just to give you a sense of what cash flows and what earnings come from that business. So, I think that's a good starting point for you.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a clarification, you said a couple of times on the growth rate that it's not linear, and it's kind of, I guess, lower through 2017 and then higher 2018 to 2020? Are those comments kind of within that 4% to 6% range year-by-year, or could it be like below 4%, let's say, before 2018 and then 6% or above in that 2018 to 2020? Just wanted to get a little more color on that comment.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yeah. And, Steve, it's not going to be linear. So, if you look back even at the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, the base numbers that we gave you on the slide, I think it's slide seven maybe \u2013 slide nine, because we still have jurisdictions where our ability to reset price comes through a base proceeding, there will be some stare-stop to our earnings as we plan for general rate cases. But if we think about over the five-year period, we'll be situated well within that 4% to 6% range.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And I think the trajectory within the five-year period have some variability. As you think about implementation of the Senate Bill 560 in Indiana and the exact timing of rate cases that we see in the back half. So, it's a little difficult to be precise, but we're trying to give you a broader picture there that it is back-loaded.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then one last question on coal ash. Could you just remind us where things stand on recovery for the coal ash remediation investments, and just when will we know kind of the recovery plan for that?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Sure. Steve, we believe coal ash costs are recoverable. We believe they are a part of decommissioning a coal plant and part of complying with environmental rules. And, of course, we have environmental rules in North Carolina, but as you know, there are federal rules as well. So, our focus here in the near-term has been moving through closure planning. We're actually excavating ash at a number of sites and working closely with the environmental agency here in the Carolinas. Our intent would be to seek recovery in connection with a general base rate increase, which as Steve indicated would be toward the latter part of this planning period.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Brian, we thought you'd call in today, if nothing else to talk about in Duke.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hello, Brian. Boy, what a (43:09) talking about, but...","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","What journalists do, talk a little basketball.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. Oh, my goodness. (43:22)","Brian J. Chin - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I will certainly follow-up offline with you on that, very important. I noticed on \u2013 in the back, on slide 57, there's been a little bit of a delay in the construction of this facility, and so DEI share maybe delayed now till early 2017. Is that the sole reason why it's been delayed, is the construction facility? Is there a potential for the ownership stake to change \u2013 for that change to be delayed, yet again, down the road?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","It's only construction, Brian, that's all is going on.","Brian J. Chin - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. That's it from me.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you so much.","Operator","Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yes.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I would just want to follow up first on Steve's question a little bit further. How are you thinking about recovery in terms of capital versus O&M of the coal ash? They're kind at some split with the latest thinking, as you begin to prepare those filings and get going there.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Julien, the way I would think about this is whether it's capital or O&M, it is a cost that we have incurred \u2013 a cash cost that we have incurred. And this cash cost to the extent that it is outside of rates can be incorporated into rates, at some point in time, in any fashion that the commission deems agreeable to do.","We've deferred purchase power cost in the past and recovered it with a return off and on. We've certainly recovered capital costs, say, of a power plant that \u2013 prior to its buildup and incorporation into rates. So, I think, conceptually, we just view it as a cost incurred for an extended period, therefore requires financing and recovery off and on in a subsequent rate proceeding.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And, I just want to clarify a little bit more on the discretionary capital budget that you delineated. It seems as an offset, largely, to the bonus depreciation bucket. Can you give us a little bit more sense as to what exactly is in there, the timing of having it realized? I suppose, just getting a sense of confidence there around, particularly, 2016 and 2017, the near-dated spend? How firm are you?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Since there are a variety of projects, at any point in time, Julien, that we are advancing and working on and planning, and then looking for the appropriate timing, given jurisdictions, given value that we can demonstrate to customers, given potential transactions that could arise. So, they're always in development. And I think, if you look at our track record over the last several years, Eastern Power Agency would have been a discretionary capital item at one point in our thinking. Western Carolina modernization would have been discretionary capital.","And so, there are always a variety of projects underway. And I would generally describe, that we have more good ideas, than we actually end up funding. We're trying to make prioritized choice of things that make the most sense for our customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just a further clarification on the latest growth rate bifurcation. If indeed you do \u2013 if you close on the Piedmont transaction, would that drive you that 5% to 6%, or would you need to see that in conjunct with other factors, just to be clear about that? How much would that drive you to the upper end? Just I think it (47:13)?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","We believe its accretive. And on a full year basis, in 2017, it would be accretive to the growth rate, so you can think about it as being above our base plan today, consistent with the way we've represented it on the slide, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Hugh Wynne of Bernstein.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Hi, Hugh.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hello, Hugh.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I just want to make sure I understood your question to \u2013 your answer to Steve Fleishman's question. Were you all saying that the growth rate in earnings will remain within this 4% to 6% band, but maybe at the lower end in the early years, and at the higher end in the later years? Or were \u2013 was the answer that the growth rate across the five-year period will be in the 4% to 6% band, but it could fall outside of that band in the early years and exceed within the later years?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","So, the way we answered the question, Hugh, was to say over the planning period, we'll be within 4% to 6%, but we would expect lesser growth in the early period, stronger growth in the later period. We did not give specific percentages year-by-year. Our typical practice is to provide a guidance for 2016, and then will continue to work and provide you better perspective on 2017. But I think it's fair to say, lighter in the frontend, stronger in the backend.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just wondering if I could ask you to comment on your vision for growth in gas transmission and gas distribution over a five-year timeframe. When the acquisition of Piedmont took place I think that was positioned, in part, as giving critical mass and a respected management team that you could then use to perhaps conduct other acquisitions. How was your thinking evolved around that?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yeah, we're continuing to work on the business plan around Piedmont, Hugh. I think if you look at their underlying fundamentals, their growing rate base at about 9% in the jurisdictions that they operate in today. They're, of course \u2013 have some pipeline investments of their own. They're on ATP in (49:37) constitution. So, we are building upon that.","We're also looking at integration planning. And what our \u2013 but our plan is to lay out a more specific gas infrastructure plan, as we get closer to the closing of Piedmont. It gives us an opportunity to finalize our regulatory approvals and set out for you where we think that can go. We took a small step today by showing you where it sits in the overall growth rate of Duke, both in terms of Piedmont and additional gas infrastructure, giving us potential to be higher in our range, but more specifics than that, we will wait until we're closer to closing.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you.","Steven K.

Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to just follow-up on International a little bit here. Could you speak to the difference in performance of the Brazilian assets versus the rest of the generation company in Argentina and Peru and Chile, down there? And then maybe also to the extent that you'd be willing to comment \u2013 would a partial sale of the assets still accomplish your goals with this type of strategic move?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Let me back up and talk a little bit about portfolio, or Steve, do you want to take the portfolio question?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, go ahead.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","So, Brazil is our single largest asset and contributor to International. If you look at Peru, we've got a combination of hydro and thermal assets. If you look at Argentina, same; Chile, same; and those markets are generally very good markets. I actually think, with the presidential election in Argentina, it's looking better situated for the long term. And so, as we think about an exit, our expectation or intent is to exit the whole portfolio, but whether we exit it altogether or individual assets, or some combination of assets, I think that will remain to be seen as the process continues.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","(52:01) Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey guys. Real quick question. When you look at the regulated utilities, and I know as a group, you're kind of expecting 4% to 6% over a number of years, can you just comment on which of those utilities could be above that into the band, and which of those utilities might be below, or maybe even just higher level? Which of your utilities you see as growing earnings faster versus slower?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Michael. Let me give you a little bit of color on this, and this changes over time as you move through rate cases and so forth. But Ohio has strong growth, in that it has mechanisms put in place to efficiently turn grid investments into earnings. Indiana is looking strong as we implement the Senate Bill 560, the t-disc (53:02) rider that will allow us to make investments in that area.","Florida is solid with the Citrus County, Hines and Osprey facilities coming into play. The Carolinas look at growth in earnings between rate cases as being a bit more challenging. And then you see a big jump in the rate cases as the investments then get turned into earnings. And there's a number of good investments there that are coming with Lee Combined Cycle and the Western Carolinas Modernization, that's later in the period there.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","And Duke Energy progress, Michael, has had very good growth as a result of the Eastern Power Agency acquisition and has growth around wholesale contracts as well. So, we actually look at each utility individually in terms of their growth potential, earnings and cash flow generation, and are always looking for where we can prioritize investment to maximize the value of the total company.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thanks so much.","Unknown Speaker",": Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Hi, Angie.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hello, Angie.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","That was close, wasn't it?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I was wondering \u2013 okay. So, just a simple math of what's happening. So, you have $0.30 of earnings from International operations, roughly were about $0.10 or even slightly less comes from the Methanol plant, so that's the one \u2013 those are the earnings that stay. And you're telling us that the 4% to 6% of growth in your core earnings already reflects some of the cash that is coming from the International operations that are being sold?","So, where is the benefit? I mean, I noticed you saying that there is some dilution of the sale, but I mean, that would imply that the dilution is way north of $0.15, right, because I'm looking at least $0.20 of earnings from International operations, and it doesn't seem like I'm gaining anything on the core business?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yeah, so I would look at a couple of things, Angie. First of all, the proceeds that accelerate repatriation will delever more quickly, the holding company. And then you do have proceeds that are in addition to the repatriation that will delever as well. So...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, I know, but shouldn't that be increasing my earnings \u2013 my core earnings, because I have less interest expense?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Yes. And the way I would describe this is, we are working through a transition in our portfolio. We're starting at $4.30 with the core business. We will use proceeds from International coming into our earnings over the next five years to provide a source of funding for growth.","And National Methanol, with the change in the ownership percentage that will occur in 2017, will only be a few pennies, handful of pennies, they should get out there into that timeframe. So, it is this part of \u2013 all of that transition is part of our confidence around financing the growth investments that we've laid out for you in the core business.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question for today will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Hello, Ali.","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hello.","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, can you just remind us, what is the size of the regulatory lag in the utilities right now? And with the five-year plan, are you assuming a significant dent in that, or does that remain relatively constant in your plan?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We have described, on slide 10, regulatory lag over the five-year period is about negative 3% on earnings, and that will vary year-per-year. Regulatory lag is depreciation and interest and property taxes, basically on capital investments that are closed prior to a rate case. And that'll build up, then you have a rate case and regulatory lag will drop, and then start building back again. So, it's an average, we looked at it over the period. And it's in the ballpark of 3% negative to the overall earnings trajectory.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, second, you alluded to \u2013 on the financing for the Piedmont acquisition and the roughly $500 million to $700 million forward equity issuance. Any sense of timing \u2013 any particular threshold you're looking at? What that \u2013 is it earlier than later? How are you thinking about that?","Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well. Let me discuss that a little bit, Ali. We will be looking at doing that fairly soon. We want to have some flexibility here. We looked at doing it in the fourth quarter last year, after the announcement, but we were getting into the holiday timeframe, the markets were a little bit volatile, so we held off. Now, we're in a blackout period, as we're closing the books, and we'll be issuing the 10-K in late February. That will open us up to have the ability to do that, and we'll start looking at the timing of the forward then.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. And, last question, the $140 million of net income that you've assumed for Commercial in 2016 as part of your guidance, can you remind us how much of that is the upfront recognition of tax credits versus sort of ongoing earnings?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","That represents primarily Renewables in 2016, Ali. There is a little bit of earnings around pipeline transmission and other things here in the Commercial Portfolio. But, the lion share of that is Renewables. And so, of course, it'll influenced by PTCs and ITC. We have a heavier mix of PTC contribution and ITC, just given the mix of assets that we own.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, Lynn is that \u2013 75%, 80% of that is tax credit recognition. That's the way we should think about it?","Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board","I think it's substantial amount or the economics of Renewables is from tax credit. So, there's a little bit in there, as I said, around infrastructures, and not all of its Renewables, but I think your percentage is around Renewable business, so are probably about right.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Buckler","Great. Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President, and CFO. ","Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Slide 2 presents our safe harbor statement. ","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Bryan, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $5.06, representing 7% growth over last year and solidly within the 4% to 6% earnings guidance range from the 2017 base year. 2019 also marked our 93rd consecutive year paying a quarterly dividend to our shareholders. We recognize that consistent growth in earnings and dividends are important to our investors, and we are delivering. I'm very proud of our employees' commitment and hard work throughout the year. We achieved these financial results while maintaining our focus on the customer. Our reliability statistics improved by 15% and our internal customer satisfaction metrics improved 25%, a clear indication that we are enhancing the customer experience. ","The foundation of outstanding service territories and ample low-risk investment opportunities to benefit our customers gives us great confidence in the strength of our business into 2020 and beyond. We have introduced a guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45, with a midpoint of $5.25, reflecting solid 5% growth into 2020. We have also expanded our EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2024, built on an expanded capital program. ","Slide 4 outlines the drivers and opportunities for expanding infrastructure in our jurisdictions. Our service territories are thriving. The Carolinas and Florida lead the East Coast and population growth, driving strong economies and energy infrastructure needs. ","GDP growth projections for those areas as well as Nashville, Tennessee also exceeds the national average. To meet the needs of our customers in these regions, we have a $56 billion capital plan over the next five years, 90% of which will be deployed in our regulated electric and gas LDC businesses and drive earnings based growth from transparent low-risk investments. Compared to our previous plan, the new plan represents a 12% increase and a projected $6 billion increase in our earnings base by 2024. ","These capital investments represent an excellent foundation to expand our 4% to 6% growth rate through 2024. Steve will provide more detail on the five year capital plan in a minute. We are proud of the work we do to power the lives of our customers. We support the health and prosperity of the communities we serve, not only through investments in our infrastructure but also through our work in the economic development, community leadership and foundation given. ","We also recognize the importance of maintaining competitive electric and gas rates. And are pleased that our rates are well below the national average, driven by top quartile O&M performance and a diverse generation mix. The strong and growing jurisdictions we serve at Duke Energy set us apart, and we will continue investing in our grid and clear generation bringing our customers the affordable and reliable service they expect from us. ","Moving to Slide 5. Our focus remains unchanged and is grounded in our vision to lead the way to cleaner, smarter energy solutions that our customers value. We place our customers at the center of everything we do. And our vision guides our actions and our investments. We believe a customer-focused strategy will also deliver superior returns to our investors over time. The strategy is rightfully underpinned by 2 foundational elements: first, excellence in operations, which we demand of ourselves and our communities require; and secondly, excellence in stakeholder engagement. ","2019 marked another year of strong results in our operations and important progress in stakeholder engagement. I wanted to share a few examples of our important work with stakeholders in 2019. We reached an important settlement with the North Carolina Department of Environmental quality and key community groups on closure plans for our remaining coal ash sites in the state. This milestone agreement clarifies the methodology and time frame to address all ash in the basins and enables us to move forward as we transition to cleaner generation. ","We believe it is a reasonable and constructive approach that protects communities and the environment, both saving our customers over $1 billion in cost. In addition, in North Carolina, we successfully advocated for storm securitization legislation, which became law in November and reached constructive outcomes in our Piedmont rate cases in both North and South Carolina. We also announced our comprehensive plan to reduce carbon emissions, targeting at least a 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. ","Our updated goals are supported by our announced plans to extend the operating licenses for all of our nuclear units. These units, which will be vital to meeting our carbon goals, achieved a capacity factor above 90% for the 21st consecutive year. We understand the importance of accelerating the path to zero carbon and look forward to working with stakeholders in each of our states to turn these goals into reality. As we turn to Slide 6, delivering superior returns to our investors drives us and is the commitment of our team at Duke Energy. ","Increasingly, our investors are also looking at our results on environment, social responsibility and governance matters. We're very proud of our track record here and consistent with our vision are committed to lead. From establishing industry-leading carbon reduction goals to announcing more than 1,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects in 2019, we're making significant progress. Last year alone, we further reduced carbon emissions an additional 8% from 2005 levels, bringing our total decrease to 39%. Additionally, our broad array of energy efficiency programs in the Carolinas have created significant savings for our customers, well ahead of national averages for these types of programs while further reducing our carbon footprint. ","Duke Energy is also committed to social responsibility, sound governance, and transparent disclosures. We issued our first climate report analyzing the two degree scenario in 2018 and plan to issue an updated report this year. Our ESG ratings reflect our work over more than a decade on sustainability initiatives, and our ratings continue to increase. Many of our investors have an interest in ESG topics, and we understand the importance of achieving excellence in these areas as we move into the next decade. We will be hosting an ESG Investor Day in May. And I'm excited to update all of you on the impressive work we're doing with Duke Energy. ","Let me close on Slide 7. Looking beyond our 5-year plan as the strength of our business and our future investment opportunities. We see great potential in the 3 investment priorities we've shared with you over the last few years. Modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Duke Energy's T&D grid across our regulated footprint represents the largest system in the nation, with more than 300,000 line miles of infrastructure. In support of our long-term strategy, we will continue to advance modernization and improvement projects to enable renewables, protected in storms and security trucks and serve the rapidly growing populations in our service areas. ","The transition to cleaner generation also provides a multi-decade investment opportunity. Our 2030 commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% includes offering our existing carbon-free resources, retiring certain less-efficient plants and investing in renewables and natural gas infrastructure. As an example, the appetite for utility-scale solar in Florida continues to rise, and we expect to bring more than 1,750 megawatts online through 2030. In the Carolinas and the Midwest, significant investments will be needed as we transition these fleets away from coal-fired generation. ","Our LDC business will also continue to produce opportunities for investment in natural gas infrastructure. We see tremendous value creation from our Piedmont and Midwest gas utilities, which are expected to grow net income at a 12% CAGR through 2024. Population and economic growth in the Southeast, coupled with the important role of natural gas in transforming our generation mix will drive incremental investment opportunities for years to come. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline also represents important infrastructure for our customers in the Carolinas. We have included Slide 17 in the appendix to provide an update on the permit status and financial considerations around the pipeline. ","We continue to work towards securing the required permits for the project as we await the Supreme Court's decision on the Appalachian Trail crossing, customer arena, balancing value to customers and a fair return for the project owners. Our expectation is that we will have a more comprehensive update on ACP midyear. ","Investing in the grid, generating cleaner energy and expanding natural gas infrastructure are critical to the customers and communities we serve and will create meaningful shareholder value for the next decade and beyond. As I look ahead, I'm more confident than ever that we will deliver strong long-term returns to our shareholders and provide industry-leading service to our customers. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Young","Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was an outstanding year of execution for the company. As shown on Slide 8, our full year reported and adjusted earnings per share of $5.06 was above the midpoint of our original and revised 2019 guidance range. ","This represents a 5% CAGR since our portfolio transition in 2017 and 7% earnings growth over 2018. During the third and fourth quarters, we recognized our exceptional year-to-date financial results and took the opportunity to reinvest in our business, deploying additional O&M dollars into customer service and funding charitable contributions to the Duke Energy Foundation. This agility positions the company well to deliver on our financial targets in 2020 and 2021, just as we did in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our strong results were driven by clear growth across each of our operating segments. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure growth was approximately $0.25 per share and was anchored by our Florida operations, which benefited from the first year of the multiyear rate plan and solar investments. ","We also saw solid growth in our Carolinas operations with strong rider revenues from our best-in-class energy efficiency programs and rate cases. These favorable drivers for the segment were partially offset by regulatory lag, primarily in the Carolinas. ","Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. We saw higher results in both our LDC businesses in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The gas LDCs continue to provide strong earnings, driven by customer additions, investments in integrity management and power generation infrastructure as well as a constructive outcome in the Piedmont's North Carolina rate case in the fourth quarter. Our commercial renewables business delivered approximately $200 million of income in 2019. Going forward, we expect this segment to continue delivering between $200 million and $250 million of net income per year over the 5-year plan. ","Overall, Duke Energy delivered outstanding results in 2019, marking another year of achieving our financial commitments. The Duke portfolio, in place since late 2016, has consistently performed well and is positioned for 2020 and beyond. ","Turning to Slide 9. As we look to 2020, we've announced our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45 with a $5.25 midpoint. This represents 5% growth over the midpoint of our original 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $5. We put together a strong financial plan for 2020, and our core utilities will continue to drive upwards earnings trajectory. For Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, growth will come from our critical investment programs. In Florida, similar to 2019, we expect very strong earnings contributions as we move into the second year of our multiyear rate plan. Results in Florida will be further supported by rapid deployment of solar generation. In the Carolinas, we will see full year contributions from the 2019 South Carolina rate cases and expect new retail rates to become effective in North Carolina in the third quarter of 2020. ","Finally, in addition to the steady income growth that comes from our Midwest T&D infrastructure investments, we expect new rates for Duke Energy Indiana by midyear. We forecast long-term annual load growth in a 0.5% range and expect 2020 to be even stronger given recent encouraging signs with our industrial customers and the benefit of leap year. The most significant 2020 growth driver for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure will be the full year earnings impact of the Piedmont, North Carolina rate case, given new rates were effective in November 2019. ","Our LDC businesses continue to experience increasing customer growth, driving year-over-year margin improvement. We're also heavily investing in integrity management programs across our footprint, recovering these important investments through annual rider mechanisms. In our Gas Midstream business, we expect higher AFUDC on Atlantic Coast Pipeline, with full construction activities beginning in the second half of the year. However, 2020's overall ACP results will be relatively flat, given 2019 benefited from a tax true up.","In Commercial Renewables, we expect a slight uptick in results this year as wind production returns to normal and as our 60-megawatt Palmer solar project will now go into commercial operation in 2020. Otherwise, this segment's results will remain relatively consistent over the 5-year plan. ","Slide 10 provides a view of our primary EPS growth drivers for 2021, many of which were similar to the 2020 drivers. Florida continues to be a major contributor of 2021 net income bolstered by the third year of the multiyear rate plan and our 700-megawatt solar investment program. We expect solid contributions from other core operations in the Carolinas and Midwest as we invest in needed infrastructure. Our LDC businesses will experience rapid growth as we deploy capital to serve new customers and increase the integrity of the existing system. And as I discussed during our November call, higher Atlantic Coast Pipeline earnings in 2021 will fully offset the dilution from the $2.5 billion equity forward that will be settled later this year. ","Lastly, I'd like to point you to our appendix slides, which highlights Duke Energy's top quartile leadership and O&M cost per customer. But we are still early in our journey. Our industry-leading innovation centers hitting its stride by scaling digital capabilities, such as mobile tools for field workers, artificial intelligence usage, drones, and automation to transform our operations and back-office processes. We will continue to leverage these capabilities to drive efficiencies and productivity across the enterprise. ","Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to reiterate some of the points Lynn shared earlier regarding the rapidly expanding infrastructure needs of our operations and communities. We have responded by increasing our 5-year capital plan by over $6 billion to benefit our customers and deliver value for shareholders. The vitality of our communities translates into long-term growth opportunities as we make significant investments and position our cities and communities to remain competitive for jobs and business development. In turn, our communities rely more than ever on our ability to attract low-cost capital to make these investments. Our unique investor growth proposition, coupled with a long history of constructive regulatory outcomes, provide the right balance to lead Duke Energy and its communities into the next chapter of our energy future. ","The Florida Capital Plan is underscored by solar investments and grid improvements, including targeted undergrounding. Storm protection plan legislation supports the deployment and recovery of these grid investments, driving our increased capital. We expect to file our SPP plans in the first half of this year with the program taking effect in late 2021 or early '22. In the Carolinas, we see significant needs for T&D capacity and improvement projects to support the expansion of renewables as well as rapid population and economic growth. Turning to our Gas LDCs. Strong economic growth drives tremendous need for infrastructure investments, including our integrity management programs. ","Further, as we transition to energy -- cleaner energy sources, we have dual-fuel capital projects at existing coal plants, which moves us closer to achieving our carbon reduction targets. This highlights the complementary nature of our Electric and Gas businesses. ","Turning to Slide 12. Our ability to execute on our robust capital program is underpinned by our strengthened balance sheet and solid credit ratings, which are stable on both S&P and Moody's. We continue to expect to issue $500 million of equity per year through 2022 via the DRIP and ATM programs. And as we discussed last quarter, once ACP comes online, we will have the balance sheet flexibility to moderate or eliminate annual equity issues. As a reminder, we plan to settle the $2.5 billion equity forward related to last year's issuance in December 2020, resulting in minimal dilution this year. ","Shifting to Slide 13. We understand the value of the dividend to our investors, over 40% of whom are retail shareholders. 2020 will mark the 94th consecutive year paying a quarterly cash dividend, and we remain a top-tier dividend yield investment. ","We are committed to continue growing the dividend in the future and finished 2019 with a dividend payout ratio of 74%. As we have said previously, our objective is to reduce that payout ratio over time, more in line with peers, particularly given our robust capital plan. Over the near term, we will set our dividend growth to better position ourselves within a payout ratio range of 65% to 75%, trending to the lower end of this range over the 5-year period. ","Before we open it up for questions, let me turn to Slide 14. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. We are positioned to deliver results for both customers and shareholders and are confident in the plan we have for 2020 and beyond. ","With that, we'll open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll first take Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. ","Shahriar Pourreza","So a big jump in CapEx and the rate base is obviously up $6 billion in 23. Can we talk a bit more on sort of the higher numbers and maybe even focusing on 23, especially in Florida, where I think you're expecting to file the formal GRCs later this year? I mean, i.e. base assumptions in the upcoming GRC versus the plan you kind of presented today? And could we see some further upside if the outcome is a little bit more constructive, especially if you've got support from sort of your healthy macro backdrop that you highlighted?","Lynn Good","Sure. Thank you for the question. We did layout in the slide deck the underlying investments around the $6 billion, $1.5 billion of it is in Florida, $4 billion in Carolinas and then we see incremental investment in our Gas LDCs of $1 billion. But I think to your point, the recent legislation in Florida represents a longer-term opportunity, and we see up to $5 billion over a decade or so of investment in that infrastructure. And as we move through the process of finalizing our existing multiyear plan and resetting that into the future, I do believe there will be ongoing potential for investment in Florida in a way that adds a lot of value to customers and investors.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then just one, lastly on North Carolina coal ash. It's obviously kind of the fluid situation still. Is there any read-throughs to Dominion's recent notice of decision, which essentially extended the recovery period for their ash spend, but with no return on that spend prospectively? I mean assuming this is kind of applicable to you, can you kind of break this outcome down relative to your $8.5 billion total CCR costs if we sort of apply that same method -- methodology as we did with Dominion?","Lynn Good","Sure. Shahriar, the first point I would make on this, which I think is really important is the Dominion order did provide recovery of the costs. And that is a significant outcome, which we, of course, believe makes sense given its decommissioning of coal plants that have provided great value to our customers over generations. We have read the notice of decision, but I also think it's important to recognize that we have not yet seen the order. So we don't understand all of the elements, we don't understand the rationale. I think it's fair to say that this order will be specific to the facts and circumstances in this case. And although we'll learn from it, I'm not prepared to say how it will impact us directly. ","But we will be presenting our case in the DEC case in March and DEP in May and hopefully have the opportunity to learn more from the order as we prepare to enter into those proceedings.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. But just a follow-up. But just given sort of your CapEx outlook and sort of how healthy it is. Is it fair to assume that you can absorb whatever outcome that does come about in that case, assuming there, for instance, isn\u2019t a return on that spend?","Lynn Good","Shahriar, when we put together a 5-year plan, we do so assuming a range of outcomes. And so that would include amortization, that would include various assumptions around cost recovery. But I also want to emphasize that we believe a lack of return over an extended amortization period is detrimental to our balance sheet and the customers over the long term, and therefore, we believe these costs ought to earn a return. There is a cost of financing associated with anything that -- of this nature, and our cost of financing should be considered as part of cost of service. So we will be making those points as part of the case.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps just to follow-up on the Carolinas here, if you don't mind. First, possibilities here on just rate case settlement and just prospects on the timeline, if you will? And then related to that, obviously, you've laid out a pretty impressive updated outlook. How do you think about this tying into some of the updates moving in-flight in parallel at the state level on sort of the grid mod side of the equation, I think, in the DEQ side?","Lynn Good","On the first question, Julien, on settlement. We always explore opportunities for settlement in every case. I think when you think about the number of issues in any rate case, if we can get to resolution of any of them in advance, we'll certainly look to do that. We did that in the Carolina cases, you may recall the last time around, at least as it pertains to ROE and cap structure. So I can't forecast with certainty how that will occur or if it will occur, but we'll certainly explore those opportunities. On your second question around how it relates to each of the jurisdictions and capital. I'll take a shot at and maybe some clarity of the question would be helpful. Recently, if we hear\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","With Carolinas, specifically.","Lynn Good","Sure. So we believe we've made the case soundly in all of our jurisdictions about the importance of the energy delivery system to be the backbone of the transition of renewable generation, storm hardening and the resiliency. We've had hurricane exposure in all of our southeastern jurisdictions over the last 4 years. And then cyber and physical security threats are something that are not unique to Duke Energy, but certainly important for our industry. So we feel like we've laid the groundwork for that. I think, Julien, we'll be involved in stakeholder meetings throughout 2020 in the Carolinas to further discussions around the clean energy plan. And as part of that, it will be not only advancement of how to achieve further carbon reduction but also further methods to modernize regulation, performance-based rate-making and other things that would fit quite nicely with our strategy around clean generation and good investment. So as the stakeholder processes progress in 2020 and into 2021, we'll look for opportunities to continue to pursue regulatory modernization that fits with these investments.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then separately, if I could just follow-up on the higher level of rate base, how do you think about the financing? Just -- I know you guys did the equity last year. You haven't projected FFO to debt metric here, but I just want to try to tie that all back together when you think about the updated stable projection.","Steven Young","Sure. As I alluded to, we priced out the $2.5 billion of equity, we will settle that in late 2020. That plus the DRIP\/ATM equity through 2022 are the equity needs that we see will finance the rest of our needs and refundings through a combination of holding company and operating company debt issuances. And we feel comfortable about that financing plan and maintaining the credit ratings.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Maybe just if I can rephrase that slightly, and you tell me if I'm not saying it right. The equity forward effectively pays for the incremental CapEx such that your metrics are largely unchanged. And then I know that there was previously a conversation around ACP and providing some buffer. Do you want to just reconcile the ACP conversation versus the CapEx plan prospectively? It sounds like you've effectively used incremental equity now to pay for the plan this year. But I just want to also make sure we've addressed the prior commentary about ACP outcomes?","Steven Young","Right. Let me give some clarity here. The incremental equity dealt with Atlantic Coast Pipeline and delays associated with that and the cash flows, that, therefore, delayed when we determine the project needed to go in 1 phase in 2022 as opposed to having cash flows coming in, in 2021. And that equity dealt with a number of ranges of outcomes with ACP, and it still does. The incremental CapEx spend that we got in the plan, we can deal with under that same amount of equity. ","We've got other tools that we've utilized. We issued $1 billion of equity content securities in 2019 at very attractive rates. We have continued to find operational efficiencies through O&M that we described earlier that helps the balance sheet as well. We executed on the John Hancock transaction, and could envision dropping other assets into mechanisms like that, that provide some liquidity. So the equity -- the $2.5 billion equity has not been used up for the incremental CapEx. We can deal with it with the equity I described.","Operator","We will next go to Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.","Steven Fleishman","So a couple of questions. First, just a technical one. The 2019, it looks like a lot of the deep versus your segment guidance came in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. Can you just explain what drove that?","Lynn Good","So we had a couple of things here, Steve, of course, strong results from capital deployment, rate case outcomes, et cetera, Atlantic Coast Pipeline is in there. And we also had a half adjustments on recognition of the way allowance for funds have been recorded on the pipeline which drove the LDC businesses as well. Steve, would you add to that?","Steven Young","Yes, I would say, looking at 2019, we had strong growth across all of our segments. You look at the Electric Utilities, we had a full year of the 2018 North Carolina rate cases. We had a partial year of the 2019 South Carolina rate cases. We saw Midwest grid continue to roll through. We had the Ohio rate case that added a few cents. Our energy efficiency rider, particularly in the Carolinas, added several cents. So we saw good, solid growth on the electric side. So I would add that.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. I'm just looking at Slide 21, where it just shows actual versus original assumptions? And it looks like Gas Utilities be by a lot. So that's why I'm curious...","Steven Young","In terms of the beat versus that [indiscernible]","Steven Fleishman","Yes. So that was -- okay. We can follow-up on that. It's just...","Steven Young","We saw growth in electric a bit and gas a bit more that pushed us above our target.","Lynn Good","Steve, the three things in Gas LDC, ACP and the tax adjustment around allowance for funds. Those are the three drivers.","Steven Young","Right.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just on ACP, at a high level, in the unfortunate event that it somehow doesn't get done. How would you characterize the -- how to think about your 4% to 6%?","Lynn Good","Steve, I would characterize the 5-year period is having great flexibility. And by that, I mean the robust capital plan that we have outlined for the utilities, positions the utilities very solidly within a 4% to 6% guidance range. And that gives us confidence that those utilities are going to continue to grow and grow well. And we have demonstrated the growth in those utilities over several years. And hopefully, that gives you confidence as well in our ability to deliver. ","I think on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, we will work our way through it. As we spoke about a moment ago, we've taken the step of strengthening the balance sheet to absorb a range of options. We have flexibility with our capital plans to make adjustments, to put in a plan B if one is required to build gas infrastructure to meet the needs that ACP would have met. We also have the opportunity to expand or accelerate good investments in a number of our jurisdictions. And then the ongoing productivity and flexibility around O&M represents another lever that we have in addressing returns over a 5-year period. ","We have demonstrated the ability to achieve reductions in flexibility in O&M across our diverse businesses, and we see further opportunities over the 5-year period. So we're committed to driving low-risk regulated growth in earnings and dividend, and we believe that we have the capability of doing that. But we will work our way through ACP, and I think 2020 is an important year to hit some of these milestones, and we'll update all along the way.","Steven Young","Steve, I just want to go -- to go back to your question, just to also let you know for 2019, we had a beat of our original target by $0.06, but I'd also want to highlight that we accelerated $0.04 of O&M from future years for foundation contributions. We also accelerated several cents for vedge management from future years in this particular calendar year. So we had a lot of optimization around 2019 as well. Absent those things, the beat would have been larger. So I just want to make it clear.","Steven Fleishman","Yes. That's great. And then one other just quick thing, that the $4 billion of incremental spending in the Carolinas, is it -- it sounds like it's mainly T&D spending. Just, is there any coal ash related spend of new plan in there? Or is that kind of past that period?","Steven Young","So there's no incremental coal ash spend in that number at all. It's a -- there's a comparable level to what we've had in the past.","Operator","We'll next go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Congrats on a constructive update. I wanted to talk about Florida a little bit. Solar economics continue to trend favorably, and you've highlighted Florida as one area of incremental growth. Over time, I guess, longer-term, if we continue to see solar costs drop, is there a fairly significant opportunity to make even bigger changes to your generation mix in the state? Or are there other reasons why that that wouldn't be the case of solar cost drop further?","Lynn Good","Stephen, I believe there are increasing opportunities, and we will watch those economics all along the way. And as I think back over even the last 2 to 3 years. Every time we set a forward forecast, it has increased and improved. And I think that will be the case into the 2020s.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. The number that you've laid out is essentially sort of -- I know you haven't specifically laid out the amount of solar you sort of put Florida together, but we'll be seeing a resource plan that you all layout in, I believe, in April in Florida, which could show further progress in terms of moving towards renewables. Is that fair to say?","Lynn Good","Yes. And at this point, we're forecasting 1,750 megawatts of solar, Stephen. And we'll continue to update that as we go. But I think to your point, as you think out over a decade, the bias is that number is going to go up.","Stephen Byrd","That's helpful. And then just lastly, going to -- start to hit on the financing needs, just wanted to kind of think through scenarios. In the unfortunate outcome, if it ends up that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project is not able to move forward either because of the Supreme Court ruling or the biological opinion, how would that -- sort of that single impact sort of your overall equity needs? And in other words, is the sort of financing plan fairly flexible and you wouldn't envision incremental equity in that scenario? Or how do you think about that that sort of outcome?","Lynn Good","Stephen, I believe we've taken care of the range of outcomes on ACP with a $2.5 billion. The one thing in the financing plan that we would evaluate as we have the DRIP and ATM on through, I believe, 2022, with an idea that we potentially could moderate in '23 and '24 if ACP is on. We will evaluate whether or not the DRIP and ATM should be a part of the financing plan in all events for '23 and '24 depending on outcome. But I think that's the only thing I would point to is something that we'll have ongoing evaluation. But we feel like that we've put in front of you with the equity that we've issued and maintaining the DRIP through 2022 with this additional capital is a solid plan that will meet our credit metrics, our earnings guidance and absorb outcomes around ACP.","Operator","We will next go to Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Can we talk a little bit about commercial renewables? And what the growth plan is for that going forward? You had some projects that pushed out to 2020. So you have a $240 million assumption for that year. And I think it's up $0.06. So that would imply about $0.19 for 2020. Is that sort of the new level going forward or is that going to grow beyond that? And how many megawatts is required to keep that up anyway?","Steven Young","Sure, Mike. We're looking at having commercial renewables contribute between $200 million and $250 million a year during the plan. It will depend on the timing of projects. But that's keeping pretty level -- pretty flat with the level that they got to in 2019. So we're not showing a lot of growth there. We did shift the Palmer solar project to 2020. That was another optimization move as we got late in the year. ","That will help the 2020 earnings. But they'll be between $200 million and $250 million a year through our plan. We've got all of 2020 lined up and locked up, and we've got 60% of the net income over the 5-year period in hand as well. So a rough number that you think about is roughly landing 300 megawatts a year of projects to keep that going. And between the markets that we're in and the crispy programs in North Carolina and so forth, we think that's very attainable.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. And ACP, you've said that you don't expect any dilution from the prior forward. As a result of earnings, and particularly after the pipeline goes in service. And I'm just wondering is that as a result of higher rates on the pipeline going forward or is it -- are you banking on higher volumes through compression? Is there a lag period between the in-service period and the lack of dilution? Or is there -- like maybe a divet period in between there?","Lynn Good","So Mike, we have given you some financial considerations on Slide 17 on allowance for funds in '20 and then full year in-service in '22 and beyond, what you can expect in terms of the contribution of ACP. The dilution that we will experience in 2021 will be absorbed by incremental allowance for funds in that year while the project is still under construction. And so I would think about putting that equity into the plan in 2021. And then the combination of the utility results we've shared with you today as well as what we're sharing on ACP is the earnings platform with financing that you can expect over the 5-year period.","Michael Weinstein","One last question. Just to confirm, how much is -- or how much financing have you already committed to the project at this point? I think it's around $2 billion, including excluding AFUDC at this point?","Steven Young","Yes, the gross project costs are about $2 billion on our books now. We've got about $800 million or $900 million of construction financing against that.","Michael Weinstein","And would you expect that to pick up, I guess, once the Supreme Court rules or is that maybe before that at some point?","Lynn Good","I'm sorry, Mike, I couldn't hear that question.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Are we at a point with additional spending start to roll insignificantly? Is it going to be after the Supreme Court rules?","Lynn Good","So the gating item on construction is the biological opinion and the incidental take statement. So the restoration of the environmental impact study. So if you look again at Slide 17, we're forecasting that reissuance of the permit in the middle part of 2020. So you should think about construction as being in the latter -- restart of construction mean the latter half of 2020.","Operator","We'll next take Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.","Andrew Weisel","So first question, a very impressive CapEx update. For '19 through '23, it looks like your spending is up roughly 15% or so. But when I look at the earnings-based outlook, the increase is more modest at around 5% depending on the year. Could you please help me reconcile those? And what are some of the offsets?","Steven Young","Yes, I think our rate base growth is at the 6% level over the period of time there. And CapEx may vary in terms of how it's loaded through the type of CapEx, but I'd have to look in more detail on that and the IR team can help you with that.","Lynn Good","Even if you look at the capital in the appendix that will give you a sense of the growth in each of the utilities. So on average, every utility is growing within the 4% to 6% range. Some are higher than that. And Gas, of course, is higher than that. But the combination, the average of all of the utilities together are at the 6% CAGR.","Andrew Weisel","Right. I understand that. I'm not talking about year-over-year growth. I'm talking about your new guidance versus the prior guidance. I should have been more clear.","Lynn Good","So we have laid out on Slide 11 kind of how this comes in. And I think we could spend some time with the IR team to give you some specifics on what it looks like in '20, '21, '22. I think the combination of that chart in the detail in the appendix, we'd be happy to walk you through.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. I'll follow up off-line. My next question is, can you talk a bit about the industrial demand. Obviously, it's -- you're not the only one seeing this, but it was pretty soft last year, fourth quarter, in particular. And then, I think, you mentioned the uplift in 2020 from the leap day, but maybe if you could just talk about adjusted expectations over the next few quarters?","Steven Young","Sure. 2019 was a rough year for the economy as a whole and that translated to our industry and lower kilowatt-hour sales. We saw that in many of our peers as well. The good news for us is that we see tremendous customer growth. We saw the best customer growth in 2019 we've seen in many years, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. As we look forward, we'll see some of that customer growth translate into some favorable growth, we believe. We also think that there will be some rebound as we look at some of our industrial customers. A few have had some singular issues with outages, supply chain issues and so forth. So we think they may get some traction as we move forward in 2020 to help rebound off a bad year. Our overall growth expectation, load growth expectation is 0.5%. And there'll be years like 2018 that are very strong years followed by some years that are a little weaker, but we think that's a reasonable place to be over the 5-year period. We do expect to see some growth over '19 and 2020 as '19 was kind of a low year. And again, we're seeing some favorable indicators from some of our industrials in our service territories.","Lynn Good","Andrew, the only thing I would add to that is all of our jurisdictions continue to perform with GDPs above national average. The weakness we saw in industrial was largely driven by some of the uncertainties around tariffs that surface in 2019. But as Steve said, we are beginning to see some signs of rebound in the specific customer circumstances and hope for a stronger 2020.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. That's helpful. Then on the dividend, Steve, did I hear you say that you're targeting the low end of the 65% to 75% range in the outer years? Why would that be and why not the midpoint?","Steven Young","Well, that's just where it tracks based on the assumptions we put there. We'll certainly monitor that as we go forward. It's nice to have the flexibility to look at the dividend as it gets to the lower end of the range, but we have that flexibility. So we're not committing to anything on that, but it's nice to be tracking in that direction.","Lynn Good","And I think, Andrew, as we more solidly position the dividend within the payout range, our longer-term goal is to grow the dividend at the same pace of earnings. And this moderation we're experiencing here in the short-term will give us the flexibility to do that over the longer term.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Very good. And then if I could squeeze one last one in here. The earned ROEs in the Carolinas, you're guiding to a modestly lower return in 2020 versus the past few years. Is that primarily related to last year's reduction in the allowed ROE? Are there other factors there? I know it's tough to discuss in the middle of rate cases, but any kind of directional commentary?","Steven Young","A couple of factors that come in, you -- as you build investment base for the upcoming rate case, you will incur some lag, as I referred to, and then you'll catch that up when you have a rate case. So some of those returns will move around depending upon rate case timing. And I think that's one of the factors to think about as well.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions and answers today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We're proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and believe that the company is well positioned not only to deliver industry-leading service to our customers but also results -- strong results for our shareholders in the years ahead. We look forward to seeing you at our ESG Investor Day in May and also look forward to any follow-up questions that you have, our IR team will be available. So thanks again for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. And again, that does conclude today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8184":["Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call November  5, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","","William Currens \u2013 VP, IR","Lynn Good \u2013 President and CEO","Steven Young \u2013 EVP and CFO","Analysts","","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI","","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy\u2019s Third Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead.","Bill Currens","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings review and business update.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance.","Leading our call today is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared we will take your questions. Other members of the executive team will be available during this portion of the call.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Earlier today, we released third quarter adjusted earnings results of $1.40 per share. These results are impacted by milder than normal weather, unfavorable results in Latin America and weaker retail load compared to the prior year quarter. Our year-to-date results remain above our internal plan, and we remain on track to achieve a revised 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 per share to $4.65 per share. Steve will provide more about the financials in a moment.","Let me spend a few minutes on operational performance and progress and how we are positioning our business for growth. Our regulated nuclear fleet set a record quarterly capacity factor of 98% in the third quarter. Our regulated natural gas fleet also performed well achieving at least 80% capacity factor at eight of our nine combined cycle plans in the Carolinas and Florida. We also continued to deliver significant benefit from the 2012 merger with Progress Energy.","Through the third quarter, we generated about $360 million of cumulative fuel and joint dispatch savings for our Carolinas customers. We are on track to achieve to guaranteed savings of $687 million over the first five years. By the end of this year, we expect to deliver non-fuel O&M savings of about $550 million, exceeding our original assumptions. It has been an active and successful quarter in advancing our strategy.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, and several of our growth initiative announcements during the third quarter, including new generation and new gas and electric infrastructure. I\u2019ll briefly summarize a few of our key announcements.","In September Duke and Piedmont Natural Gas announced a joint venture with Dominion and AGL Resources, to build and operate the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The 550 mile natural gas pipeline begins in West Virginia and runs through Virginia and into Eastern North Carolina. Duke will have 40% ownership interest in this project through our commercial business. The pipeline has a total construction cost estimates of between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.","The pipeline is over 90% subscribed and a binding open season for the remaining firm transportation capacity is currently underway. Our regulated subsidiaries in the Carolinas will enter into 20-year gas transportation agreements with a pipeline. The Utilities Commissions in both North and South Carolina have approved our regulated subsidiaries entering into these agreements. Since the announcement the project has received broad support. Over 5,000 letters have been received across the project\u2019s three state regions voicing support for the pipeline. An independent study estimates that the project can generate a total of $2.7 billion, an economic impact by 2019, supporting over17,000 jobs.","The project requires FERC approval, which the joint venture will seek to secure by the summer of 2016. Last week, Dominion on behalf of the joint venture submitted a pre-filing with FERC, which begins the extensive review process. Construction is expected to be completed in late 2018.","Secondly, we plan to invest in our transmission and distribution infrastructure in Indiana. In August, we filed a seven-year $1.9 billion grid modernization plan with the Indiana commission, under legislation recently enacted. The plan uses advanced technology and infrastructure upgrades to improve service to our Indiana customers. Hearings are set for December, with the decision expected in the second quarter of 2015.","As highlighted on our last earnings call, we finalized an agreement for the $1.2 billion purchase of the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency\u2019s minority ownership in existing nuclear and coal generation. This transaction provides significant benefits. The proceeds will allow the Power Agency\u2019s cities to reduce their customers\u2019 rate and debt burden. Duke Energy Progress customers will also benefit from long-term cost savings and increased fuel diversity.","Last month we filed for FERC approval of the asset purchase agreement and the 30-year full-requirement wholesale agreement with the power agency. Under the agreement the transaction must be completed by the end of 2016. In September, we announced plans to commit $500 million to solar expansion in North Carolina. This supports compliance with the state\u2019s renewable portfolio standard. In addition to signing power purchase agreements with five new solar projects for 150 megawatts, we will acquire and construct three solar facilities totaling 128 megawatts.","We have filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for approval to transfer the Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity for the facilities to be acquired. These important growth initiatives support our ability to continue providing our customers affordable reliable energy from increasingly diverse generation portfolio, as well as providing a solid foundation for our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%.","Now let me turn to Slide 5, which summarizes our new generation projects in the Carolinas and Florida. Overall, these projects will replace generating capacity that has or will be retired. And will help us meet the long-term load growth in our service territory. These projects represent around 3,000 megawatts of capacity and almost $3 billion of investments through 2018.","During the quarter, the Florida Commission held hearings to review the need for our proposed 1,640 megawatt combined-cycle facility in Citrus County, and the 220 megawatts of uprates at the existing Hines facility. Last month, the Florida Commission issued certificates for both projects. We expect the Hines uprate to be online by the end of 2017, and the Citrus County plant to be online in 2018.","Site certification approval for Citrus County is expected in late 2015. We continued to evaluate our options for additional capacity in Florida. We are negotiating with Calpine on the potential purchase of their Osprey combined-cycle plant. We\u2019re also continuing to evaluate the addition of 320 megawatts of peaking capacity at our Suwannee facility. We expect to ultimately move forward with one of these options. We will keep you apprised of our plans as we finalize our evaluation and make filings with the Florida Commission later this year or early next year. A potential Osprey acquisition would also require FERC approval.","Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019ll provide an update on coal ash management activities during the third quarter. In August the North Carolina legislation passed the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014, which became law in September. This law requires closure of all coal ash basins in the state within 15 years, while preserving the ability to make site-specific closure decisions based on science and engineering. It also establishes the nine member of Coal Ash Management Commission to oversee implementation of the law.","It requires the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to evaluate and issue a proposed classification for all wash basins as either high, intermediate or low risk by the end of 2015.","The law designates the ash basins of Dan River, Asheville, Riverbend and Sutton as high priority and requires them to be closed no later than August 1, 2019. We have begun developing excavation plans, permitting applications and other work at these four sites. We will be filing our excavation plans for these four sites with NC DENR later this month.","In a moment, Steve will provide an update on the accounting implications of the law. During the quarter, we also took proactive steps to advance our coal ash management program. First, we announced the new centralized internal organization to manage all coal combustion products. We also announced the formation of the National Coal Ash Management Advisory Board, a panel of nine independent experts from fields such as engineering, waste management, environmental science, and risk analysis. This panel will help guide our strategy for permanent ash storage and base enclosure.","Before, updating you on Edwardsport, let me provide some comments, on the EPA\u2019s proposed rule for regulating carbon-dioxide emission from existing power plants. Since issued in June, we continue to evaluate the rule and engage with our state regulators. We are developing comments and plan to submit them to EPA by the revised deadline. We have made significant progress over the last decade in reducing the environmental impact of our generating facilities. We\u2019ve invested over $9 billion in building new state-of-the-art plants, as well as $7.5 billion in environmental controls. These investments have resulted in CO2 emission reductions of more than 20% below 2005 levels, as well as significant SO2 and NOx emission reductions.","It is important that the rule recognize these investments for the benefit of our customers. Our comments will focus on the composition and achievability of the four building blocks as well as the interaction between the building blocks. We are also focused on the pace and timing of the required reductions, specifically the interim date requirements and the potential impact on system reliability.","Nuclear is an important part of our generation fleet in the Carolinas, the appropriate treatment of existing and new nuclear generation in goal setting and compliance will also be an important area of focus. We expect the rule will receive a significant volume of comments as well as legal challenges. We will continue to keep you updated on our thoughts on this rule making as it evolves over the coming months.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7, in our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which achieved commercial and service in June of last year. We have completed GE\u2019s rigorous performance testing protocol and have validated that all major technology systems are working. To achieve substantial completion of the contract with the GE, we are finalizing the plants ramp rate performance, which we expect to complete later this year.","Planned output and overall performance has improved during the year. Gasification availability averaged 75% during the second quarter and 70% during the third quarter, including a planned maintenance outage to begin in September. Gasification availability exceeded 90% during the critical months of July and August. This plan is well-positioned to reliably serve our Indiana customers for decades to come.","The right side of the Slide outlines the status of the regulatory proceedings associated with the plant. IGCC-11 is fully briefed and we are awaiting a commission order. The commission will hold hearings on IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 in February. Orders are expected for all three pending proceedings in the first-half of 2015. The commission will examine the operational performance of the plant in the normal course of reviewing our semi-annual writer filings.","Any Edwardsport IGCC-related fuel costs are reviewed in connection with the quarterly fuel costs proceeding. We will continue to update you on these important regulatory milestones. Before turning the call over to Steve, let me update you on the sale of our non-regulated Midwest generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash.","As outlined on Slide 8, we expect to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2015. The closing date will depend on the timing of approvals including FERC, Department of Justice, and our release from certain credit support obligations. The use of proceeds for this transaction remains under evaluation and will be determined as we approach the closing. Proceeds could be deployed in a combination of funding growth investments, avoiding future holding company financings or a stock buyback.","We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and expect the transaction to be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in 2015 or 2016, depending on the closing date and how the proceeds are redeployed. We will keep you updated in our progress in the coming months.","Overall, in looking back at everything we have accomplished so far this year, I am pleased with how we are executing our business plans, advancing growth initiatives, strengthening our operational performance and delivering reliable service to our customers. We look forward to a strong finish to 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.","Steven Young","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll focus on four areas: first, the primary drivers of our third quarter results; second, our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories; third, important accounting changes made in the third quarter; and finally, I will close with our financial objectives including the status of our 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range.","Let\u2019s start with the major earnings drivers for the quarter, as outlined on Slide 9. Our quarterly adjusted diluted EPS $1.40 was below the prior year\u2019s quarterly results of $1.46 per share. As we discussed during our last earnings call we expected slightly higher adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, compared to last year.","However, adjusted earnings this quarter were hampered by three principal drivers. First, weather was below normal by around $0.06 per share. Additionally, unfavorable results at International Energy and lower retail customer load growth also contributed to reduced third quarter earnings.","Overall, based on the strength of the first two quarters we remain on track to achieve our revised 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share. On a reported basis, we earned a $1.80 during the quarter compared to $1.42 last year. Reported results include an approximate $475 million pre-tax reversal of a first quarter impairment charge related to the sale of our Midwest generation business. This impairment reversal is recorded in discontinued operations and has been excluded from the company\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share results.","Next, let me discuss the key quarterly earnings drivers for each of our major segments. I\u2019ll start with our largest segment, Regulated Utilities, where adjusted earnings were essentially flat during the quarter. For the second summer in a row we experienced mild weather compared to normal. However, the weather this quarter was normal than last year, driving favorable quarter-over-quarter results. Cooling degree days were around 10% below normal in the Carolinas and almost 30% below normal in the Midwest.","Other favorable drivers included higher pricing, primarily associated with our 2013 rate cases at Duke Energy Carolinas and a favorable effective tax rate. These impacts were offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense primarily associated with the new assets in the rate base and lower retail customer volumes. We also entered into a fuel settlement this quarter offsetting the benefit of revised rates at Duke Energy progress. Cost control efforts have helped us achieve flat non-fuel O&M when compared to last year\u2019s quarter. We are driving costs out of the business through our merger related initiatives.","International Energy\u2019s quarterly results were $0.05 per share lower this year primarily driven by higher purchased power cost in Brazil resulting from core hydrology. We also had an unplanned outage at one of our hydro facilities in Chile. This outage has been resolved and the unit is currently online. As you will recall we operate hydro generation plants in Brazil that are dependent upon adequate reservoir levels to generate electricity. In 2014 Brazil has experienced the most severe drought in around 80 years and reservoir levels are at near historic lows. In response to the draught Brazil\u2019s regulatory authorities are dispatching thermal generation at full capacity.","In anticipation of below normal rainfall and challenging hydrological conditions we\u2019ve reduced our contracted capacity levels for 2014 and have taken similar actions for 2015. We will closely monitor reservoir conditions as we move through the fourth quarter and enter 2015. Commercial Power\u2019s adjusted earnings were $0.05 per share higher, primarily driven by increased earnings at the Midwest generation business. Midwest generation was supported by higher PJM capacity prices which increased from $28 per megawatt day in the prior year to up $126 per megawatt day currently. The other segment variance was primarily driven by a favorable prior year state deferred tax adjustment. More detailed quarterly adjusted earnings drivers for each of our segments are included in today\u2019s presentation materials and press release.","Moving on to slide 10, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. In the third quarter of 2013 we experienced strong retail load growth of 1.7%, a challenging level from which to grow period-over-period. As we saw in the first quarter of 2014 adjusting for weather can be imprecise especially over shorter periods of time. For these reasons we find low growth trends more meaningful when evaluated over a longer term period.","Through the third quarter weather normal retail load was 0.7% higher on both a year-to-date and a rolling 12 month basis. This is ahead of our full year expectations of 0.5% growth. We continue to see growth in the industrial class. In fact this was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in this sector. Results in our commercial and residential sectors have been more volatile. Based upon historic trends we believe the consistent growth we have seen in industrial will expand to the other sectors as the economic recovery gains more solid footing.","Let me briefly highlight some of the recent trends we are monitoring in each major customer class. First, the industrial sector, where sales grew 0.6% over the rolling 12 months. We have experienced recent weakness in our Duke Energy Progress territory where sales continue to be negatively impacted by two chemical plant closures late last year. Outside of Duke Energy Progress industrial activity in our other jurisdictions remained strong with overall growth of around 2% over the rolling 12 months. The Midwest and Duke Energy Carolinas jurisdictions continue to see strength in the metals, chemicals and transportation sub-sectors. Building product manufacturers have also shown recent strength.","Next the commercial sector where sales grew 1.1% over the past 12 months. Overall, this sector continues to benefit from recent strength in the healthcare, education and government areas across all jurisdictions. This strength has also been supported by positive long-term employment trends.","Turning to slide 11, I\u2019ll provide some insight into our residential sector, which has experienced 0.5% growth during the rolling 12 month period. As you can see in the chart the total number of customers in our jurisdiction continues to grow consistently by around 1%. We experienced 1.5% growth in Florida, 1% growth in the Carolinas and around 0.5% growth in the Midwest. However, volatile customer usage trends effect overall residential load growth. Customer usage can be impacted by energy efficiency and conservation efforts, changes in median household income, unemployment trends and rising demand for multi-family housing. Overall, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the future based upon the broad trends in the economy. The economic expansion is projected to continue with GDP expected to grow at nearly 3% for the remainder of 2014.","Employment activity in the states we serve remains generally favorable with unemployment rates at or below the national average. To-date in 2014 approximately 20% of U.S. non-foreign job growth is in states served by Duke Energy, particularly in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Our affordable electricity rates continue to attract businesses to our service territories. Our economic development teams are actively pursuing potential projects within our six state footprint. So far this year several new business relocations and expansions have been announced in our service territories, representing around $3 billion in investments and more than 9,500 new jobs.","Based on the retail sales growth we\u2019ve experienced over the rolling 12 months and the underlying favorable economic forecasts we remain confident in our longer term growth expectation of around 1%. We expect individual quarters to vary but the longer term economic trends are generally favorable.","Let me spend a moment discussing two important accounting matters that occurred during the third quarter as outlined on slide 12. First, accounting rules require the recognition of an asset retirement obligation or ARO liability of approximately $3.4 billion as a result of the passage of coal ash legislation in North Carolina in September. This obligation has been capitalized on the balance sheet as property plant and equipment for active sites and those are regulatory [assets] for retire sites. The ARO is based upon a discounted probability weighted assessment of various ash basin closure methodologies costs and timelines. The ultimate cost will rely on the sites specific risk classifications and closure methodologies approved by Dinah and the Coal Ash Management Commission as well as the anticipated federal rules for coal ash. We will update the ARO as closure plans continue to evolve.","We also had two accounting implications related to the sale process of the Midwest generation business. As you may recall in the first quarter we\u2019ve recognized a pretax impairment of $1.4 billion based upon the estimated fair market value of the assets. Our agreement to sell the Midwest generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion is higher than our original estimated fair value. Therefore, we have reversed around $475 million of the previously recognized impairment in the third quarter. This reversal is recorded in discontinued operations and has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter.","As a result of the Dynegy agreement, our Midwest generation business now meets the accounting criteria to be classified as discontinued operations for GAAP reported purposes. As we announced at the commencement of the sale process the earnings from this business will continue to be included in our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2014. Despite the mild third quarter weather and poor Brazilian hydrology we are ahead of plan for the year. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share. This range implies fourth quarter adjusted earnings between $0.80 and $0.95 per share.","Slide 13 outlines the key drivers to consider when evaluating our expectations the lower earnings per share in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. Many of these drivers are consistent with what we have encountered during the year.","Let me briefly discuss a few of the drivers that may not be as intuitive. First, we do not expect a significant quarter-over-quarter variance for revised customer rates as our prior year rate cases were all in effect for the entire portion of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Related to the 2013 rate case activity we expect a negative driver in the fourth quarter due to the implementation of nuclear average cost levelization in late 2013. You might recall we realized $0.11 of favorable earnings per share in 2013 mostly in the fourth quarter as well implemented this accounting treatment.","This year we expect about $0.05 to $0.06 of a lower benefit in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower results in Latin America, principally driven by the impacts of drought condition in Brazil and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Finally we expect a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter than the 31% we recognize last year. We anticipate the full year adjusted effective tax rate of 32% to 33%.","Slide 14 highlights the building blocks of our long term adjusted earnings growth objectives of between 4% to 6% through 2016. The left side of these slides shows the components of our base plan which supports an adjusted earnings per share growth of around 4%. This base plan is underpinned by around $3 billion in annual growth investment and assumes modest retail and wholesale loan growth coupled with effective cost management. Lynn outlined the progress that we\u2019ve made this quarter advancing our incremental growth opportunities, including the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the NCEMPA asset purchase. These incremental opportunities along with [low] growth in excess of 0.5% and optimization of our commercial portfolio give us confidence in our ability to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth objective through 2016.","Slide 15 outlines our financial objectives for 2014 and beyond. These objectives have remained consistent overtime and we have an established track record in achieving each of these objectives. We are on track to achieve our 2014 revised guidance range and our long-term adjusted earnings growth objective. We are also focused on the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. During the third quarter we increased our dividend by 2%. This was the seventh consecutive year we have increased the dividend. We expect to move into our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% this year providing additional flexibility going forward.","Our balance sheet and credit ratings remain strong allowing us to invest in our business without the need for new equity issuances through 2016. As we normally do in February we will provide our updated financial plans to 2015 and beyond.","Now I will turn it back over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","In closing the third quarter demonstrated significant positive momentum in delivering value for our customers, communities and shareholders. And we are laying a strong groundwork and foundation for the future. Now we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to Julien Dumoulin Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, Good morning.","Steven Young","Hi, good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Thanks, first question on the ARO and the overall CapEx OpEx composition of potential spend with the coal ash, could you just give a little bit of flavor around how much this could turn into an earnings opportunity in whatever parameters you can describe?","Steven Young","Well, we have recorded at this point the ARO liability and while we have not begun to spend any significant funds we will begin spending that money in 2015 as we identify four plans that we are going on pretty quickly. Our focus right now is getting these plans approved, getting the permitting done, getting the logistics in place. The ultimate cash spend will be impacted by the decisions made by Dinah and the coal ash commission regarding many of the sites. Ultimately the cost recovery aspect has been kicked to the Utilities Commission. We have made no application for recovery because we haven\u2019t incurred any cost. So ultimately the dispositions of that into customer rates is yet to be decided.","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Fair enough. Then turning to the international business I\u2019d be curious where do you stand in the strategic review and specifically does the latest hydrological developments in Brazil impacts that review in any sense and really what\u2019s on the table at this point as the process continues?","Lynn Good","So we are continuing to review all options and had set an internal timeline of late \u201814 early \u201815 for our review and we are on pace for that Julien. I wouldn\u2019t say specifically that the hydrology in the year of 2014 is impacting that review, but certainly hydrologic risk, regulatory risk, market risk and opportunities are part of what we are assessing. So when we reach any important milestone in that review we will certainly update you but at this point Julien I don\u2019t have anything further to discuss.","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Great and then if you will, just turning to Florida quickly, [Necter] has talked about some other opportunities potentially adding solar in the state, gas reserves, I\u2019d be curious what\u2019s your thought process on pursuing those avenues as well?","Lynn Good","At this point our focus is on the significant generation build that we have underway to replace capacity in the states that we are focused as we remarked in our comments on combined cycle upgrades and adding additional capacity. We certainly believe that solar represents an opportunity for the State of Florida as it makes sense for public policy and requirements of our customers and we will pursue that at the right time but I would say our focus at this point is on the gas capacity.","Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS","Great, well thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Greg.","Steven Young","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Going back to page seven on Edwardsport can you review the dollars that are being reviewed for recovery in the rider proceedings and what the risk is f the commission were to decide that you weren\u2019t performing up to their expectations?","Lynn Good","Greg, I think, we can take you offline on the specific dollars in each of the filings and the team would be ready to do that as soon as the call over. Let me just give you some color generally about the proceeding. So the commission would be taking up IGCC-12 and 13 in February. They will be focusing on the operating results of the plant. There have been challenges by certain of the interveners during November of 2013 around the concept of negative generation when the plant was down and was drawing power from the grid. We also have discussed previously that we had some challenges during January with freezing 30 degree normal in Indiana we would expect the commission to be reviewing operating activities during that period.","So I think between the IGCC filing as well as fuel there will be a comprehensive review of operations and our focus has been on continuing to improve performance and I think the demonstrated results that we shared on the call with 90% availability for the gas supplier in July and August and the overall capacity factors demonstrate that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks I will get them offline. That\u2019s all I got, thanks.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Steven Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I wanted to discuss your tax position and your Latin American assets. Apparently we don\u2019t know where you\u2019ll ultimately come out in terms of your strategic review but if you were to think about selling assets and repatriating the money back to the US, can you discuss your tax position at a high level, I know you have a large US tax loss position, just curious how we should broadly think about tax implications if you were to try to repatriate a fairly large amount of capital from Latin America?","Steven Young","Okay, let\u2019s look at the cash on hand. We\u2019ve got about $1.6 million overseas offshore right now. If we were to make an assertion that all of the previous earnings were to be repatriated over time, we would record a tax liability in the ballpark of $300 million to $350 million.","We have not accrued any U.S. taxes on the international operations, but if we said all the past earnings were going to ultimately repatriate, that\u2019s what we would record on our books. Now because of our current NOL position and under the current tax laws with the expiration of bonus depreciation, we would expect to come out of the NOL in 2015 and start utilizing tax credits. We would not be a significant tax payer until 2016 or 2017. So the actual cash outlays related to income taxes on our international operations wouldn\u2019t be made for a few years down the road.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So you do essentially, Steve, get some benefit from that tax loss position that you had when you think about bringing capital back, but there is still an accrual, there is still some degree of cash costs when you bring that money back?","Steven Young","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We have both the accrual to catch-up taxes on all the previous earnings, and then the actual cash outlays would be a bit later.","Lynn Good","And so the GAAP accounting or the generally accepted accounting principles require recognition of liability, Stephen, but the cash payment would occur, as Steve indicated, after the NOL is absorbed and we move through the utilization of renewable credits and so on.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I see. But if you were to try to bring the capital back, let\u2019s say in late 2015, would your tax loss position allow for some degree of a shield of the cash that would be coming back from Latin America?","Steven Young","I\u2019d have to look back at the numbers more closely, but I believe there would be some tax shield there for a period of time, couple of years perhaps.","Lynn Good","Coming into 2014, the NOL was $2.7 billion, Stephen, and I think the other thing that we would need to evaluate depending on what happens in the lame duck session is bonus depreciation extended. I think there are number of other moving pieces that could impact that assessment as well, that you may want to consider.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s a good point. Just wanted to shift over to your pipeline investment and I wanted to better understand how to think about the actual cost of gas that you\u2019ll be procuring. When you source the gas, would you be procuring gas at sort of the overall Henry Hub price, or would it need to be at a discount to Henry Hub because it\u2019s essentially coming from low-cost shale plays and you\u2019ve got to factor in transport costs? In other words, it\u2019s sort of \u2013 is the cost of the pipeline kind of in your mind, the sum cost, and then you pay for billing Henry Hub rates, or does that transport need to factor in, and therefore you would be paying a lower price for gas essentially than what we might see in the Gulf of Mexico?","Lynn Good","So I think the combination of things that you\u2019re talking about are still under evaluation on specifics, Stephen, so we don\u2019t have a specific price of natural gas that we\u2019ve locked into in Marcellus. We will have a price that\u2019s implying the transport as we look at making that multiyear commitment for the utilities, but as we stand back and look at the diversity of supply, look at the pricing out of Marcellus, look at the pricing of this additional transport facility into the Carolinas, we think there is a very compelling business case for our customers to have access to low-price diverse sources of gas. And so that\u2019s exactly the business case that we believe excess for underpinning this investment for the benefit of our customers.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just on last \u2013 this might be \u2013 I might be reading too much into this, but last slide \u2013 last quarter on your 4% to 6% growth build-up slide, you said finalizing international strategic review and now you just you\u2019ve dropped the word finalizing. Were you close to something that you\u2019re now not close to, and the process sort of extended out a bit, or is the way do you communicating anything that?","Lynn Good","I think you\u2019re reading more into it. And we should use you as part of finalizing our slide, Jonathan, to point out where we\u2019ve used language differently. No, in all seriousness, we\u2019re on the same pace we were on second quarter. And I would love to tell you that analyzing international tax is something that can be done quickly, but there are a variety of complexities and analysis. We\u2019re taking our time. This is an important part of our business that has contributed well for a long period.","And so when we have an update on that, we will certainly share it but we\u2019re on target to complete our work late \u201814, early 2015.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So you\u2019re fairly confident then that you\u2019ll know the outcome on that by the time you give your \u201815 outlook, I guess with the year-end call?","Lynn Good","So that\u2019s certainly our target, Jonathan. And just to step back for a moment, when we undertook this review, we were looking at several dimensions. One dimension is, how do we optimize cash? We\u2019ve had opportunities to bring home cash in a couple of large transactions over the last several years but we would love to solve cash in a way that was more predictable and more consistent with funding in the dividend.","And then secondly, we\u2019re evaluating is there a way to improve the growth profile of the business in light of what we see as near-term to mid-term headwinds, currency, pricing, etcetera. So our intent as we finish, our review would be to share our perspectives on both of those objectives, and the work we\u2019ve completed that could accomplished some or all of this objectives as we complete our work.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you. And then just somewhat similar question I\u2019m afraid, but when you first announced the Midwest generation sale, you sounded more robust about the idea that it would be accretive. Now you are saying that it depends on the timing and the ultimate use of proceeds [indiscernible] one way or another on use of proceeds that makes you less confident that this is an accretive deal?","Lynn Good","Jonathan, we continue to see accretion. What we were trying to communicate is the timing is not completely firm, we were hoping actually when we started to close by the end of \u201814. We think it\u2019s probably more early \u201815. And so we\u2019re just kind of talking about that timing as we share that perspective.","Steven Young","But ultimately we do see this as an accretive transaction certainly.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right, great. Well, thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi guys. Just curious, did anything change in terms of your thought process regarding rate case timelines, if any, in Carolinas. The only reason why I asked is the solar CapEx, the development of the Lee facility, just curious about how you get those in rates?","Steven Young","We have no direct plans for rate case activity in the Carolinas right now. We\u2019re looking at our cost structure as we move forward. Typically when you try to play on rate case as I think about data points on rate cases, you look at when a base load plant moves into service, because your cost structure changes at that time. Lee has been scheduled for late \u201817 or during 2018 for commercial operation for the Carolinas. So that might be a point that you\u2019d look at there. Shortly following that or plant additions for DE progress as well.","So that\u2019s kind of your starting point. But we\u2019re looking at our cost structure between now and then, in light of other factors. And that could compel us to move earlier or it could push us back later if other events occur.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And can you give us \u2013 change in topics a little bit, when thinking about the Indiana smart grid rollout, what the annual \u2013 kind of the average annual revenue increase tied to that would be?","Steven Young","So it\u2019s about less than 1% to around 1%, lower for industrial. The industrial class will not participate in all of investment. And we\u2019re targeting somewhere around $250 million of spending a year around over the seven-year period.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you, Lynn. Thanks Steve. Much appreciate it.","Lynn Good","Thanks so much.","Operator","We will go next to Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. I have a couple of questions. My question goes to Slide 14, where you outlined your sort of 4% to 6% EPS growth trajectory and the drivers that will get you there. 4% growth over \u201815 and \u201816 in earnings is kind of an 8% increase against a 1% increase in retail load over that period, 6% growth over \u201815, \u201816 would be a 12% increase in earnings against maybe slightly more than 1% growth in retail load. I was just wondering, if you could help me understand, how you\u2019re going to close that gap in a way that\u2019s tolerable to rate payers. I understand that 4% range we\u2019re hoping to do with wholesale growth and cost control and the 7% range we\u2019re hoping to do it with accretive acquisitions, but I wonder if you just might give more color on how you close that gap? And secondly, what the long-term implications for EPS growth of 5% load growth are beyond 2016?","Steven Young","Yes so \u2013 and let me discuss the growth trends broadly here. As Lynn mentioned, we\u2019ve put together some investments in the pipeline the NCEMPA acquisition. Those provide a strong earnings growth to Senate Bill 560 during the three to five year period we will start to produce some earnings as well. So we feel confident about the earnings growth rate on a longer term basis.","When you look year-to-year, some of the drivers to think about, you\u2019ve got weather normalized customer growth and that\u2019s modestly forecasted at 1%. We also have wholesale sales growth and contracts that we\u2019re stepping into, that have produced earnings for us as well. Some of our investments, although not put into rates, do approve AFUDC between rate cases, and that can provide some earnings enhancement as well.","Our commercial renewables business has provided a solid 1% earnings growth on a total company basis as well, and we think that business will continue to grow for us.","So those are some of the metrics that we look at when we think about our longer term earnings growth rate trajectory. The ability to control O&M between rate cases is critical to utilities as well, and we certainly demonstrated that.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Let me just ask a more specific question about the international business. You mentioned that you have this [indiscernible] in Brazil. What are the earnings implications of that beyond the quarter? Are you expecting that a year of depressed earnings, or will it take even longer to reestablish a reservoir from Brazil?","Steven Young","I think when you\u2019re thinking about Brazil hydrology, one of the \u2013 probably the key factor to think about is the upcoming rainy season, which typically runs November\/December through March\/April. And I think the results of that rainy season will be critical to decisions made in 2015. I wouldn\u2019t try to guess at what that rainy season would look like, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019d see any rationing occur unless there was a third consecutive core rainy season, and it\u2019s the force rationing that really has an impact on earnings.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thanks a lot.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Steve, I wanted to be clear on the growth rate targets you had talked about, the 4% to 6%. So as you pointed out, some of your growth initiatives like the pipelines and the additional buyback of the assets from the municipalities etcetera, those are going to start really contributing to you more in the timeframe beyond \u201816. So if I am hearing you right, should we assume that, that contribution keeps you on the 4% to 6% growth rate beyond \u201816, or should we think of those actually taking you above the range? How should we think about these growth initiatives relative to the 4% to 6%?","Steven Young","Yes, we will be rolling out beyond \u201816 in February, as we\u2019ve traditionally done. And that\u2019s the point which we\u2019ll be discussing the longer term projections of earnings, but right now we feel comfortable through \u201816 with the 4% to 6% earnings growth rate.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. But in a high-level sense, is it fair to say that this keeps you on-track, that kind of run rate?","Lynn Good","Ali, I\u2019ll jump in. 4% to 6% is our long-term growth aspiration. We spend a lot of time in 2014 laying the foundation and groundwork for that, by putting projects in place that will give us an opportunity to deploy the capital necessary to achieve that growth rate. And so we are on track to do that. We think we\u2019ve demonstrated that with tangible projects that will deliver earnings that are consistent with what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, consistent with a strong dividend paying company.","So we\u2019ll, as Steve said, update more specifics in February, but we believe that we are putting the pieces in place to deliver a strong growth rate.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then Lynn, can you remind us, the grand jury investigation around the coal ash spill. What\u2019s the status of that? Is that still ongoing, or what\u2019s happening there?","Lynn Good","So the litigation continues Ali, and I can\u2019t discuss any specifics on those matters, but I will say is we\u2019re cooperating fully defending the company. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings at this point, but of course, we\u2019d provide updates when they are milestones met.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And my last question, as you talked about using the proceeds from the Midwest sales, one of the potentials for that is share buybacks, but if I put that in the context of these big mega projects, the pipeline and the acquisitions coming up, and put them in the equation, Steve you said, no equity issuance through \u201816. Should we think of this as no equity issuance even beyond \u201816 when some of this big capital spend is going to be used on that \u201817, \u201818 period?","Steven Young","Well, again right now I can\u2019t project beyond \u201816. We\u2019ll be finalizing our plans for beyond \u201816 and discuss that in February. But we\u2019ll be looking at our various spend for coal ash, other investments such as the pipeline in NCEMPA as we make those decisions, and we\u2019ll be firming up beyond \u201816 in February for you.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, but conceptually you\u2019re okay with buying back stock now if you think that makes sense, but then issuing equity in a year or two later if it\u2019s required, I mean, conceptually that\u2019s not an issue?","Lynn Good","No, Ali, I would say that as we look at the options for the Midwest generation, we\u2019ll be considering the timing of all these matters including investments. And our objective is to optimize proceeds and investments in the way that creates the greatest value for shareholders. So I would say all options are on the table at this point and we\u2019ll share more specifics as we move forward.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Fair enough. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Hi guys, good morning. Just a very, very quick question. Just on the international, I guess with \u2013 again oil is up actually today, but with oil down so much, I just remember from your initial guidance that you gave back in February. You had a sensitivity on Brent crude, I think it was $10 movement, it\u2019s like $0.02, and never really paid a lot of attention to that. So as you get into next year, obviously we don\u2019t know where Brent crude is going to be, but I guess it\u2019s down about $30, $35 from the beginning of the year. How should we think about that for National Methanol?","Steven Young","Well, the sensitivity that we gave, Andy, is correct. About a $10 movement is $0.02 and that\u2019s a $10 average movement on an annual basis, to make sure that\u2019s clear. So that\u2019s the sensitivity, and that relates to our National Methanol subsidiary, which is a portion roughly 25% of our international business.","So we will bake that into our forecast and keep an eye on where oil prices are moving as we make our projections in February.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","And does slightly policy \u2013 that has nothing to do with it at all as far as how they allocate oil to Asia or to the U.S. and they are pricing there. That doesn\u2019t\u2026","Lynn Good","No. And Andy this correlation that we\u2019re sharing with you is a rough correlation. We\u2019re not actually in the oil business.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Right.","Lynn Good","Okay. So the correlation has generally worked over time. We make more money when oil prices are high and less when oil prices are low, but it\u2019s not a perfect correlation.","Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI","Thanks. I have a follow-up question on the pipeline. Just maybe you can clarify a bit. Traditionally the shippers bear the costs of moving gas to where it\u2019s been consumed. And I guess the question is, whether or not because the cost of transportation on new pipes like this, especially given the negative basis that the Marcellus producers are already facing versus Henry Hub is so high might be prohibited for them to make it economic. Is it likely that the transportation costs will be borne to some degree by the consumers?","Lynn Good","So we are entering into long-term transport contracts on the part of our utilities. That was what we put in front of the commission this, Greg, this quarter, so that we could enter into those multiyear transport contracts. And that\u2019s part of the transaction. So the utility customers will bear the transport.","Steven Young","That\u2019s right. And these costs are typically passed through the fuel cost mechanisms.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI","No, I completely understand it\u2019s a non-traditional framework relative to what E&P analysts generally think about, in your pipeline as well as some others have gotten push back from E&P investors that, well, it just seems like a very expensive transportation cost. And I pointed out to them that these are consumer-sponsored pipes and I just wanted to get some clarification on that.","Steven Young","That\u2019s correct.","Lynn Good","That\u2019s a demand concept [ph] versus supply. So I think that key distinction, Greg, is we look at the need for natural gas in the Carolinas and our dependency on a single pipeline, we think this diversification makes sense for our customers.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI","I completely agree. I just wanted to understand the economics. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","So thank you everyone, and thanks for your interest in Duke. We look forward to seeing many of you next week in Dallas at EEI. So thanks again.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

As a result of our financial performance for the first half of the year, we have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to $4.50 to $4.65 per share.","I'm very pleased with how we are executing our growth strategy, delivering on our commitments and building positive momentum for the future. July marked the second anniversary of the merger between Duke and Progress. As a result of great focus and team work, we've exceeded expectations from the combination.","After two years, we have achieved 45% of our total five year fuel and joint dispatch savings commitment for Carolina's customers. We've exceeded our original non-fuel O&M savings target and we recently completed the eighth required transmission project, ahead of schedule and under budget.","We believe the combination continues to deliver significant value for customers and shareholders. As we leverage our scale and operations and in capital deployment.","This morning, I would like to update you on the progress of our growth projects, our efforts to maximize value from our commercial portfolio and the status of our efforts around coal ash management and the operational performance of Edwardsport. Then I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss the specifics of the quarter.","First growth, for the 5-year period from 2014 through 2018, we are targeting between $16 billion and $20 billion of growth investments. These investments include new generation, infrastructure projects and regulatory compliance initiatives, all of which underpinned are 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate.","The investments is outlined on Slide 4, allow us to meet the needs of our customers and grow the company well into the future. We have made significant progress to advance our portfolio of new generation projects including gas fired generation in Florida and South Carolina and renewable generation in our commercial and regulated businesses.","In mid-May we announced plans for three major constructions projects in Florida as outlined on Slide 5. These projects represent a total investment of about $1.9 billion and include a 1,640 MW combined cycle plant in Citrus County. Two new combustion turbine plants that are existing Suwannee plant and an operate project at our Hines Energy Complex.","These projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2018. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings on these projects later this month, with an order anticipated this fall. Next, turning to South Carolina we received commission approval in April for our proposed 750 MW Lee combined cycle natural gas plant.","The plant is expected to be operational in late 2017 and Duke's share of the investment is expected to be approximately $600 million. Turning to Slide 6, while provide an update on our renewable growth investments. Through 2018, we are targeting total investments of around $2 billion in our regulated and commercial renewable businesses.","We presently have 400 MW of wind and approximately 100 MW of solar under construction in our commercial businesses. In a regulated business, we were encouraged by the strong response we received to our solar RSP in North Carolina and are presently negotiating power purchase agreements and ownership options for approximately 300 MW of regulated solar generation.","We are also pleased with progress in South Carolina, where the state recently passed comprehensive solar legislation to encourage development of renewable generation. This legislation followed a yearlong collaborative process with important environmental stakeholders.","We expect to invest in or incentivize renewable generation of up to 3% our peak load capacity by the end of 2021 representing approximately 150 MW. The law also establishes a process for the commission to review net metering rates, which we expect to occur over the next nine months to 12 months.","We will continually to work collaboratively with all interest stakeholders as this legislation is implemented. As summarized on Slide 7, last week we announced an agreement to purchase the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency's minority ownership and certain existing Duke Energy Progress plants.","In all about 700 MW of nuclear and scrubbed coal generation that we already operate. The asset purchase price is $1.2 billion and we would also enter into a 30-year full requirement wholesale contract to supply power to NCEMPA. This agreement provides benefit to both the customers of Duke Energy Progress and the members of NCEMPA.","If approved, this transactions would be one of the largest municipal power plant transactions on record. Under the agreement, we are required to close the transactions by the end of 2016. This project is incremental to the capital plan that we shared with you in February and provides additional support to our long-term earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6%.","The ultimate annual earnings contribution from this investment will be dependent upon the timing of closing, appropriate regulatory treatment and how the company chooses to finance the transaction. We currently expected full year earnings, uplift of between $0.05 and $0.10 per share.","There are a number of important regulatory milestones that are critical to the successful execution of this purchase. We expect to start this process with FERC filing at the end of this month and will provide updates as the approval progresses.","Let me also highlight a couple of infrastructure investments that we are developing. As you know last year, Indiana passed [indiscernible] 560, which was design to streamline implementation and recovery for transmission and distribution infrastructure needs, we plan to make the filing this year resulting in potential investments over 7 years of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.","And in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for a major new natural gas pipeline into North Carolina. We received initial bids in June and expect to announce the winner within the next several weeks. While Carolina's utilities expect to enter into a gas transportation contract with the pipeline and we are pursuing an ownership interest in the pipeline underpinning the projects financial liability.","The RFP has an initial capacity of at least 900 million cubic feet per day with a targeted and service date of late 2018. We continue to make progress with initiatives related to our non-regulated commercial portfolio as outlined on Slide 8, the exit of the Midwest merchant generation business is progressing.","We are in the final phases of due diligence and expect to announce the winning bidder in the next few months. The closing of any transactions is likely to occur in late 2014 or early 2015. Use of proceeds for this transaction are under evaluation and could include a combination of funding growth investment opportunities, avoiding future holding company financing or a stock buyback.","We are committed to redeploying the proceeds in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and expect the transaction to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share beginning in 2016. We are also making meaningful progress on the evaluation of our international business; we are considering a wide range of options including opportunities for growth as well as tax efficient strategies for utilization of our $1.7 billion in offshore cash.","We expect to complete this review late this year or early 2015. Next turning to Slide 10 let me provide an update on Dan River. As you know, we have taken responsibility for the accidental discharge of coal ash in early February and have been working on cleanup activity at the site and the river.","Our work at the site and the river has been under the direction of the EPA. Last month, we announced that we have met the EPA's requirements to-date, but we'll continue to monitor the rivers' water quality. Our overall goal is to ensure the long-term health of the river.","Cost incurred on cleanup activities were approximately $20 million of the first six months of the year. We do not expect total cleanup cost related to the Dan River incident to be material. We are cooperating with and defending the company in ongoing investigations resulting from the Dan River accident.","We have also made progress on our comprehensive plans around the near term and longer term management of each of our coal ash basins. We are committed to developing a scientific engineered solution for each site that will protect the environment and allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable and cost effective electricity for our customers.","We expect to finalize the development of comprehensive closure strategies by year-end. Ultimately our plans will need to be in alignment with any final legislation in North Carolina and upcoming federal rules for coal ash, which were expected by the end of the year.","Our Ash Basin closure cost will be dependent upon the methodology selected and approved for each site. We will continue to refine our projections for closure cost and provide updates as our plans are finalized.","We believe the recoverability of coal ash based in closure cost will be determined by the Carolina's Commission. Next let me provide a brief update on the recent legislative session in North Carolina where the General Assembly introduced legislation addressing the management in closure with Ash Basin.","The legislator did not come to an agreement on a compromised bill and adjourned last week. The adjournment resolutions contemplate the coal ash legislation could be considered during a reconvened legislative session later this month or later this year.","It's important to highlight, that this delay will not impede our actions or our commitments to working constructively with all parties to continue advancing our comprehensive plans for the long-term management of coal ash in North Carolina.","Next let's turn to Slide 11 and our Edwardsport plan in Indiana, which achieved commercial in service in June of last year because Edwardsport is a large and complex project [indiscernible] made it that it would build up to its long-term level of availability over 15 months.","I was at the site last month and I'm pleased with the progress as well as the dedication of the plant staff. Plant output and overall performance have steadily improved since early this year. When extreme [indiscernible] or cause operational challenges.","May, was the strongest month we have seen for gasification to-date and June was not far behind. In fact, gasification availability during the second quarter was around 75%. July's results were also favorable with gasification availability coming in around 80%. We have completed GE's rigorous performance testing protocol and have validated all major technology systems are working.","We are reviewing the test data received from GE and preliminary results were positive. During testing we achieved the nameplate capacity of 618 MW and had encouraging preliminary results on heat wave.","The right side of the slide outlines a status of the regulatory proceedings associated with the plant. The Indiana Commission has combined two semi-annual rider updates, IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 and will hold hearings in November.","IGCC-11 is fully briefed and we awaiting the commission order. The commission will examine the operational performance of the plant in a normal course of reviewing our semi-annual rider filings, while any replacement power cost resulting from the operational performance for the plant are reviewed in connection with the quarterly fuel cost proceeding.","We will continue to update you on our operational progress in these important regulatory milestones. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.","Steve Young","Thank you, Lynn. Today I'll focus on three primary areas. First I'll discuss at a high level, the primary drivers to our second quarter results and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. Second, I'll discuss our volume trends in the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I'll close with our progress toward achieving our overall financial objectives.","Let's start with the major second quarter earnings per share drivers as outlined on Slide 12. This morning, we announced 2014 second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share at $1.11, which exceeds 2013 second quarter results of $0.87 per share. We saw higher quarterly earnings at each of our three business segments.","As expected, quarterly results were supported by revised customer's rates. Growth in our regulated wholesale business and higher PJM capacity prices. We also experienced favorable weather and a lower effective tax rate during the quarter.","As Lynn just mentioned due to the strong results experienced through the first half of the year. We have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to $4.50 to $4.65 per share. I will discuss more details on our revised guidance range at the end of my presentation.","On a reported basis, the company earned $0.86 during the quarter compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included the supplemental materials. Adjusted earnings at our regulated utilizes segment increased by $0.13 per share during the quarter.","We continue to benefit from increases associated with our 2013 rate cases in the Carolina's an increases from newly contracted wholesale customers. We experienced favorable weather this quarter compared to below normal weather last year in the Carolina's cooling degree days were around 10% higher than average.","The utilities experienced lower effective tax rate during the quarter driven by a State tax settlement that resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred taxes. O&M cost were also favorable during the second quarter. Partially driven by a prior year donation associated with Duke Energy Progress's rate case and benefits from nuclear average cost levelization [ph].","Absent these drivers our cost control efforts have helped us maintained flat O&M compared to last year's quarter. We continue to drive cost out of the business through our merger related initiatives and are targeting flat O&M cost through 2016. International Energy's quarterly results were $0.09 per share higher this year, primarily driven by a $0.07 favorable tax benefit resulting from a reorganization of the company's operation in July.","As a result of this benefit, we are lowering our overall consolidated adjusted effective tax rate assumption for 2014 to between 32% and 33%. National Methanol's contribution for the quarter was $0.02 higher than last year primarily due to an extended maintenance outage that occurred in 2013.","Commercial Power's adjusted earnings were $0.02 supported by increased wind and solar volumes from new projects coming on line and higher output from existing projects. Higher PJ and capacity prices drove increased results from Midwest Generation. More detailed quarterly earnings drivers for each of our segments are included in today's presentation materials and press release.","Before moving on, let me briefly update you on hydro conditions in Brazil. We continue to closely monitor reservoir levels as we have significant contracted hydro capacity. During the second quarter, the rainy season came to an end and reservoir levels remain low. In order to help preserve reservoir level, Brazil's regulatory authorities continue to dispatch thermal generation in anticipation of below normal rainfall and challenging reservoir conditions.","We reduced our contracted capacity levels for 2014. This reduction in contracted levels along with higher short-term pricing has helped us to mitigate significant negative financial impacts from the drought, so far this year.","Slide 13, highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. Overall weather-normal retail customer load for the quarter, was 0.4% higher than 2013. This was in line with our overall expectations for the year.","We evaluate the economic growth of our service territories of the longer term periods; on a rolling 12-month basis weather-normal retail customer load was 1.6% higher. We continue to be encouraged by broad trends in the economy such as higher median household income levels, low unemployment rates and new customer additions.","We remained confident in our longer term growth expectation of around 1%. Economic activity is expected to continue expanding over the remainder of the year. In fact, consensus estimates expect GDP growth to be around 3% in the second half of 2014. Employment activity in the states we served continues to improve with unemployment percentages at or below the US average, in four of the six states we serve.","In June, approximately 20% of total US non-farm job growth, which from state served by Duke Energy. Next let me highlight some of the trends, we are seeing in each of our customer classes.","First; our resident customers with quarter-over-quarter growth was essentially flat. Household income and available credit heavily influenced this customer class. While these indicators have not yet recovered to pre-recessionary levels. They have shown improvement over time. During the quarter, we continue to experience positive growth in the number of customers that our regulated utilities of around 1%.","However, usage per customer was unfavorable during the quarter, largely offsetting the growth in the number of customers. Next, our commercial class experienced quarterly growth of 0.5%. Office vacancies and unemployment rates continue to improve leading to growth and retail sales.","Continued higher sales were seen in education, health care and hospitality sectors when compared to last year. And finally, the industrial sector experienced growth of 0.8% in the second quarter. We continue to see encouraging strength in the automotive, construction and metal sub sectors.","Economic development within our service territories remains active. Our affordable electricity rates help us track businesses to our service territories. Our economic development teams are actively pursuing potential projects within our six-state footprint which could represent up to $10 billion in new investments and over 20,000 jobs.","So far this year, several new business relocations and expansions have announced in our service territories representing around $2.5 billion in investments and more than 5,000 new jobs. We are optimistic about the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories.","Based on the growth that we've experienced over the ruling 12-month basis. The individual quarters may vary, but the longer term economic trends are generally favorable. I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 and the longer term is outlined on Slide 14.","These financial objectives have remained consistent over time. We have an established track of achieving each of these objectives. I'm very pleased with our financial performance through the second quarter. To-date we have benefited from revised grades in the regulated businesses, favorable weather, solid growth in sales volumes and favorable impacts of tax rates.","Additionally, we continue to drive more efficiencies across the company. We still have our third quarter ahead of us, which is historically our most significant quarter. In July, we experienced mild weather and do not yet know, if that trend will continue into August.","We also expect to accelerate the recognition of certain expenses in to 2014. Primarily, a coal unit outage in the Carolina's as well as some cost to advance our coal ash management work. Despite uncertainty with the weather for the third quarter, we are pleased with the strength of our results to-date and increasing our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range.","We will update you on our progress, when we reported our third quarter results in early November. The balance sheet remains strong, the strong affords us the flexibility to invest in our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances, through 2016.","We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. In June, our Board of Directors, approved an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend. This marks the seventh consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We expect to move into our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio range of 65% to 70% in 2014, allowing greater flexibility in future dividend growth.","Finally, as Lynn discussed we are focused on executing our growth initiatives as well as our cost management efforts. We are well position to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth within our 4% to 6% target through 2016.","Additionally, some of our growth investments provide support for growth beyond 2016. Now I'll turn it back over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Before closing, I thought I would briefly comment on the EPA's recently proposed rules for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plant. Since issued in June, we have been evaluating this complex rule in engaging with our state regulators. We intent to remain actively engaged in the tool making process.","We support policy that will result in reasonable decreases in greenhouse gas emissions overtime, while balancing impacts to our customers, the economies of our service territories and the reliability that our customers count on.","We have made significant progress over the last decade in reducing the environmental impact of our generating facilities. We have invested over $9 billion in new generation. Allowing for the retirement of over half of our coal fleet.","And our remaining coal units, we've invested over $7 billion on environmental control equipment. As a result, through 2013 we've reduced our carbon emissions by 20% from 2005 levels. Well also achieving two reductions of 84% and NOx reductions of 63% during the same time period.","As we engage in this proposed regulation, our comments will focus on ensuring that this progress is recognized and that these investments continue to deliver value to our customers over the remaining useful life.","It's important that our customers receive the full benefit of our early actions, not just actions since 2012. The treatment of nuclear both new and existing is also a clear area of focus for us. The complexity of this rule requires careful study and evaluation, not just of each potential building block, but the interaction of all elements together.","We expect significant comments as well as legal challenges to the rule and we will remain engaged throughout the development of this important rule making. In closing and we are executing strategy in a thoughtful and disciplined way, that continues to build momentum and deliver value for our customers, communities and shareholders.","And we are developing growth opportunities as we position the company for the future. Now I'd like to open the lineup for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","So, bit of a strategic questions rather than focusing on the quarter because it was clearly, it was a great quarter for you guys, congrats on that.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","There's always been this issue, with strategic review of Latin America, which is really like, okay what are we going to do with the money -- back ? But now, you've got the power plant consolidation investment potential further investment in major pipeline, the potential for the necessity of incremental major investments to remediate your ash ponds.","So can you talk about how the sort of burgeoning necessity for capital in your core business might change, the way you're looking at, your Latin American business?","Lynn Good","Greg, the way I would respond to that is, we've had growth aspirations in the range of the $16 billion to $18 billion to underpin our 4% to 6% growth rate for some time and so we've been analyzing all of our strategic evaluations in the context of positioning the company to grow and so when we talk about, the strategic analysis of international, when we look at decision to strategically outfit the Midwest generation, all of that review has been within the context of better positioning the company to grow and deploy capital in the way, that it adds value.","So I would think of all those things together and we will provide you with further updates on our thinking and progress on these initiatives as they occur.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Can you refresh our memories, as to your last public comments on the tax efficiency of bringing back the $1.7 billion?","Lynn Good","We haven't made any specific comments, Greg on that item. Let me just maybe give you a little bit of background. We did bring home $700 million in a very tax efficient format, in December of 2013, so that was $700 million basically a basis reduction initiative.","We now have a $1.7 billion offshore and we are continuing to look for ways that we can put that cash to use in a tax sufficient manner, so that study is underway as part of the strategic analysis. So you can think of cash utilization supported the dividend and growth is being the three primary objective.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, my last question when you gave the range $0.05 to $0.10 as the annualized earnings impact of the power plant consolidation, what are the financing assumptions that underline that, does that assume sort of debt in equity at sort of consistent with the balance sheet of the Progress Energy Carolina's or some other variable.","Lynn Good","So depending on financing structure, it would fall within that range, Greg depending on how much equity is included and how is debt financed. Steve, would you add to that?","Steve Young","Yes, I would point out that roughly one half of the purchase price would be finance through Opco debt, so we are talking about roughly $600 million that would be of the equity piece that could be financed through cash or through HoldCo debt, I don't envision the need to issue common equity to deal with this.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thank you, guys.","Lynn Good","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just extending maybe little one on Greg's line of question, when we think about 4% to 6% earnings growth range through 2016, I guess when do you think you're going to, maybe reevaluate or maybe put more time horizon on that number and then B, with the pipeline out there, with kind of the redeployment of the money's from NCEMPA and selling commercial generation that sort of stuff, what's going to swing you within the 4% to 6% as you see it right now?","Lynn Good","To take the two questions, Dan we will continue to follow our traditional approach on guidance and updated in February, I think we've been in 3-year range for the last couple of years. So that we have provided capital for a 5-year period, so we will continue to update that.","I think, the drivers for growth include capital investment and both the regulated business as well as load growth, cost efficiencies, additional renewable growth, which would be both regulated and non-regulated and so, as I think about variables, they can impact earnings over a short or a long-term period. Load growth comes to mind, ability that control cost come to mind and the efficiency and magnitude of capital deployment.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay and then I guess on the coal ash issue, with the EPA rules, stating out there are kind of variety of different fingers in the pot. When do you think, we are going to finalize to have visibility into full capital obligations or capital expenditures and kind of timeline for putting that capital to work?","Lynn Good","The EPA rule that would be [indiscernible] Dan, is expected in December the designation of hazard or non-hazard I believe the timeline for that remains. The plans that we have put forward at this point, have us in a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for ash basin closure that's consistent with our historical range of waste disposal updated for the comprehensive plan that we put forward in March.","So I think, there are couple of things to watch in terms of refinement of these numbers. One being, we will continue to develop power strategic approach for closure of all of the basins and we are targeting the end of this year. We also have the delay in the legislation in North Carolina, which could be finalized this year that would impact that.","And then, I would expect all of these plans to come under review by the regulators in North Carolina over the years to come, which could continue to refine it. So I think, we will reach milestones over 2014 and 2015 for our plants here in the Carolina's and then, it will of course keep you updated as these milestones occur.","Steve Young","And I would also add that, the expenditures related to this activity span many, many years. This is well over a decade to deploy these funds.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great and I guess, last question is kind of on load growth. I feel like the last couple of quarters there is more optimism that maybe demand growth is going to sneak above the 1% target you guys have talked about this quarters in the little less enthusiastic unlike for you guys, but across the industry.","Can you just talk about trend line and what you're seeing in, if you think the second quarter is more indicative for what you saw, in the preceding quarters is maybe where trend was?","Steve Young","Well, Dan you've hit on the challenge of looking at quarterly data. Certainly the first quarter of 2014 was probably heavily influenced by weather. We tried to pull the impact of weather out, but that's as much hard as science. The second quarter, the results were lower in line with our forecast, but when you look at a 12-month rolling average, you see that we are around 1.6% growth.","The broad economic indicators continue to improve and we look at unemployment number of customers added in our service territories household, median household incomes, those kind of things. Overall, we do feel like it is improving, but given the volatility that we continue to see quarter-to-quarter we are not ready to move beyond the 1% long-term growth.","We will be updating our forecast normally in the fall and see what it looks like then.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Firstly, this one question on what you said about the drought in Brazil. Steve, I believe you said you've taken down the sales commitments and that had substantially mitigated what would have been more negative impact.","Can you give us a sense of how much of the residual negative that still in the 2014 number as you see it now, if any? And just a bit more some more numbers around what you said that?","Steve Young","Well our contracting strategy has paid off benefits so far in the first two quarters of 2014 as we mentioned. We are not in the position to predict, how the final two quarters will come out. We are out of the wet season. The reservoir levels are low, during the low 30% and this is the time of year, where they will decline will come into a new rainy season in the fall and that will be critical to the final results for the year.","The contracting strategy of lowering should benefit as well throughout the year, but again it's hard to say where those reservoir levels are going to be and what hydro capacity is going to be available to serve the commitments we have at this time. We'll just have to wait and see.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Through the first two quarters, is it bad to say, your actions mitigated any negative impact or there was still some drag embedded in the numbers?","Steve Young","Well, the first two quarters certainly are contracting strategy was beneficial to us and perhaps I'm not understanding your question. I don't know enough to predict the final two quarters.","Lynn Good","So Jonathan, what I would add is, we were in line with our expectations for the first two quarters for Brazil and it's the items that Steve talked about, the lower contracting gave us the ability to take advantage of higher spot prices in the first two quarters.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","You kind of ended up about on plan and your comment as you avoided, what you otherwise been a loss.","Steve Young","That's true.","Lynn Good","For reductions and earnings, yes.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes and then secondly, could you comment at all about the recent reports that you'll involved in the late stages of [indiscernible] sale in Colombia, just in the context of your comments about being focused on potential growth avenues in international business?","Lynn Good","Jonathan, we are not involved in the late stages of bidding for [indiscernible].","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you for that and I think, one other thing I just wanted to clarify, you mentioned that NCEMPA transaction is, incremental to 4% to 6% is that more in the sense of, it's incremental beyond 2016 or is that statement more, this could push you above the growth rate in 2016, how should we've going to interpret that?","Steve Young","I would think about the NCEMPA investment as giving is confidence in the 4% to 6% growth rate. It's the type of capital the discretionary type capital projects that we are pursuing and certainly this will provide earnings over its life of the wholesale contract with municipalities beyond, but I would say, it gives us confidence in the growth rate.","Lynn Good","Jonathan, the incremental comment that we made, its incremental of the capital that we shared with you in February.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Lynn Good","We've been trying to increase that growth from the $16 billion to the $20 billion by identifying and pursuing these growth initiatives, so this is one of the key ones.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So that whole Slide 7, should been seen as sort of the difference between $16 billion and $20 billion effect of it?","Lynn Good","That's correct.","","Steve Young","That's correct.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning. It's Julien here, actually.","Lynn Good","Very good. How are you, Julien?","Steve Young","How are you, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","I wanted to follow-up on a few items here. First with regards to the pipeline RFP, could you talk a little bit about potential ownership interest and also talk a little bit how that might be structured to what level, you might take that ownership, etc.?","Lynn Good","Julien, it's premature to go into any more specifics on this, as we pursue the solicitation. We did pursue of course options, we were looking for transport capacity for the utilities, so were also looking for an ownership interest and so that will be a part of our ongoing discussions as we finalize, this solicitation, but I don't have anything more specific to share at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Fair enough and then moving on to the coal ash side, could you give us a sense, one; where the conversation is today with respect to the total spend versus what you disclosed previously and then secondly as you think about that, how does it compare, what are the key moving parts here as we look towards negotiations in the back half of the year, for total spend?","Lynn Good","Julien, you may recall and it's actually in this slide deck as well in the appendix. We put forward a range of spending for North Carolina around the ash basins that began in the left hand side of the chart. I'm referring you to Slide 40 at this point, on the left hand side of the chart representing our historic numbers for waste environmental spending updated for the plans that we put forward in March, 2014 following Dan River.","On the right hand side of the page, would be a full excavation of all ash and North Carolina as well as conversion to zero liquid discharge. There are expectations, is that we will end up somewhere in between those two numbers overtime and as I shared in the comments earlier in the call. Those final estimates will be revised as closure strategy and the methods are developed and approved. Right now based on the commitments that we've made, I would say we are in the range of the 2 to 2.5, but these numbers will be refined as additional work, engineering, science, approvals, etc proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","All right, thank you and then moving back to the international side, if you don't mind. Could you talk a little bit more about how to make any potential transaction accretive? And specifically what I'm getting at is how do you think about potential partnerships and driving synergies out of any deal? Perhaps is there an opportunity used the offshore cash back to invest in the growth as a way to perhaps transform the business.","Lynn Good","I will say, all options are on the table, when we do a review of this sort looking for ways, that we can streamline the business, looking for ways we can drive growth, optimize cash, etc. so I would say all options are on the table at this point and as we progress and reach final conclusions will of course provide an update.","We are targeting end of 2014, early 2015 at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","And just to be clear, a little nuance there, does the current hydrological situation drive timing or consideration of transaction etc?","Lynn Good","No.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Okay, excellent. Well thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just a couple of questions about the good all fashion regulated side of house. When you think about rate cases, over the next year? What new ones do you anticipate filing across the system?","Steve Young","Michael, in terms of looking at our rate cases, we had a lot of activity in 2013 in the Carolina's and Ohio as well. So we don't have any base rate cases planned for a while. Our settlement in Florida, sets up a lot of trackers for significant cost, but keeps us out of base rates for a while.","So we don't have any plans through 2016 for base rate increases. We may look at our Duke Energy Progress, South Carolina jurisdiction as a potential area. We'll keep an eye on that, but nothing in the near term given all the activity that we concluded in 2013.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. One other questions and this is about the potential new projects would you developed down in Florida as well as the NCEMPA acquisition you've disclosed. One the Florida one, there is a lot of opposition to those developments because there still is, Florida is one of the States, where there are still a lot of non-regulated merchant, combined cycles and peekers [ph] kind of hanging around, guys who are obviously willing to sell into a utility either RFP or actually sell the asset to a utility like yours.","Just curious in terms of how you think regulators will look at that option, with kind of the cost benefit analysis and also if you can address on the NCEMPA process there was a lot of going back to the progress merger, there was a lot of back and forth with the FERC bell [ph] potential market power issues in the Carolina's, how would think acquisition kind of screen in terms of market power in the Carolina's?","Lynn Good","Taking both of those, Michael on Florida. I think you've raised a key question on whether or not the investments that we've put forward represent the lowest cost option for customers and that will be the center piece of the regulatory review in August.","We believe that, the process that we've undertaken, which include in RFP for the Citrus County combined cycle will support that what we put forward is the lowest option, but I think that will be the center piece of the regulatory proceeding that will occur, this month continuing through the final approval process.","On market power, we report very closely at this. We do not see a market power issue with the NCEMPA transaction. A couple of things I would note, is we are acquiring generation and load of a comparable amount. So we are not acquiring excess generation and the fact, that we already operate these units has us in a position, where the dispatch of the units will not change as a part of the acquisition.","So those are both, we believe key considerations in the market power analysis.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks, Lynn. Much appreciated.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jim [indiscernible] from TRT Capital. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","I've got a couple of simple questions. One is on the dividend, I know you have this targeted 65% to 70% payout ratio, but as I do some of that math. It seems like you still have a little bit of room to grow above the 2%, what do you think about raising the dividend better than the 2% that you have been doing thus far?","Steve Young","Well, as we've said understand the value of the dividend to our overall proposition. We are now moving into our target range, we've been above at for a while. But that gives us as we've said, as time goes forward. We can continue to earn as we should, that should give us more flexibility and we will certain be looking at increasing the dividend growth rate.","Ideally, we would like to get more in line with our earnings growth rate, but it remains to be seen when and how that happens.","Unidentified Analyst","The second quick question is, on the 4% to 6%, thank you for the answer. Second question is one the 4% to 6% growth rate. Can you just refresh our memory is to what, is the base year on that, is it 2013?","Steve Young","Yes, it's the midpoint of the projected earnings range for 2013.","Unidentified Analyst","Right, okay and then last question, is on your Slide number 4, you talk about the new growth investments is $16 to $20 billion over this period through 2018, one of which buckets is new generation is $6 billion to $8 billion, but if just add the numbers up, on the Florida combined cycle lead and the renewable everything, I come up to a number that's less than $6 billion, how should I think about that remaining $2.3 billion or so, to get to that high end of that $8 billion range, so that place hold is that you're just not ready to talk about publicly at this point in time?","Steve Young","Well, I think you can think about our businesses as a whole and kind of zero in on some things. We are going to need to build some new facilities in the Carolina's to meet load growth in the back end of the year, at 1.5% peak load growth, you're going to be growing 300 MW, 400 MW is the Carolina's every year.","So every couple of years, you're going to need combined cycles or at least simple cycle CTs in the Carolina's. So there is a fair amount of generation that's going to come in that area, as well. So that will fill a lot of that gap there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, so the gap is accounted for, it's not something that we should be looking for in subsequent announcements, is what you're saying?","Steve Young","That's correct and also some other categories of spin that are in the total number compliance with EPA regulations. A lot of math work to be done in the next few years and a lot of nuclear related expenditures particularly related to Fukushima.","So there is a number of those types of investments that help fill out the portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Understand. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial. Please go ahead.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital","Couple of kind of scattered questions. First the sale of Midwest gen, you're obviously aware that DPL withdrew their plans from the market. Does that affect what you're doing at all?","Lynn Good","No, Kit. Our process is been part of a strategic evaluation that we undertook at the end of last year continuing into this year and so we are moving forward with our decision, don't have any specific milestones to announce, except to say that process is continuing and we expect to close later this year or early 2015.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital","Right and how about on the North Carolina pipeline, can you give us any detail of timing on that?","Lynn Good","No, we expect to finalize the review of the solicitation within the next few weeks, Kit and would make an announcement at that time.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital","Okay, so that's obviously in \u2013 and how should we understand Lynn both with regard to the pipeline and to renewable investments? How should we assess Duke's degree of interest in either of those? I mean, are either of those areas going to become a major business segment or this one off type of investments?","Lynn Good","We think about the pipeline into North Carolina, is a very strategic investment for the company, Kit. We see it's being strategic not only the state of North Carolina but to electric supply and the State of North Carolina, as we continue to add gas. I think this will give us an important entry into pipeline and if you think back to the Spectra spin, Duke has had a history of interest in pipeline investment, but I'm not foreshadowing any strategic shift, what we'll focus on at this point is the North Carolina investment.","I would say, the renewable have been a part of our story sometime. We continue to add to our commercial renewable business, as well as introducing renewables in our regulated jurisdiction. We see that as an increasingly important part of the portfolio and I think we mentioned in the call, that we have 400 MW of wind and 100 MW of solar under construction right now in support of our commercial businesses.","Another 300 MW of solar, that we're negotiating under an RFP and North Carolina. So I would expect to see additional renewable investment in the years to come.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital","All right and finally, in Florida, Steve you were talking about no red cases in the near future and so on, what I assume you're keeping an eye on the political situation down there. What would it do for your regulatory outlook in Florida, if Charlie Crist made another stunning come back here and became Governor again.","Lynn Good","You know, Kit that's a difficult question. We have to work with all stakeholders and all legislators, governors in our jurisdiction. So we are focused on running our businesses as well as we possibly can, we're also focused on making investments for the long-term value that we can deliver to our customers and we watch politics much like you do.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital","As a spectator sport, that's how I watch it. I don't know about \u2013 obviously it's more important for you. All right, thank you very much","Operator","We will now take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just a some really quick ones, a lot of my questions have been answered, but the growth avenues, Jonathan asked you about specific potential acquisition, but I'm just wondering whether or not there is anything in general that you guys might be interested in or that you could share with us, that some general area that you guys might be, that sort of opened up, that you guys might be pursuing or?","Lynn Good","Are you referring to international?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Yes, I'm sorry, yes I'm referring to international to growth, I'm sorry. Yes.","Lynn Good","Yes, we don't have a specific project that we'd point you to, one of the underpinning of the strategic review as we see headwinds in Latin America from currency and potential re-pricing that puts us in a position where the growth rate isn't as strong, as we like it to be.","So we are undertaking the strategic review to look at all elements including growth and efficiency and utilization of cash, but we don't have any specific project that we would draw attention to today.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay and then with respect to the coal ash legislation. There seem to be to sort of competing bills that were sort of buying for against one and another and I was just wondering, if there was any things, that we might have in terms of and I have realized that obviously, those are two potential outcomes and there could be obviously another outcome that could happen or not outcome I guess. I know you guys are working at, regardless you guys are sort of aggressively pursuing the cold ash situation, but how should we think about those potentials outcomes, I guess and what potential impact, it may or may not have on your projected growth rate, in earnings?","Lynn Good","Paul, what I would say is that the either the legislature has been delayed, I think it's difficult for us to speculate at this point about, either the timing of reconvening or the scope and approach of the legislature would take. I do think, there is a strong commitment on the part of General Assembly to get the legislation right and so they're being deliberate and thoughtful in their process.","And we have given you some broad parameters around, how we think about the potential cost and the other things that I would indicate that you should keep in mind, with all of the ash, if this is going to play over a number of years.","So even if you look at the existing profile of this Senate and House bills, there were targets over five years and 10 years and 15 years over deployment would be an over a very long period of time.","So that's all I would say at this point and will of course keep you informed as progress occurs.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Well, is it safe to say perhaps that within your, reach [ph] that you've given these outcomes would probably be within that range regardless of which one would happen or does that make sense, you got what I'm saying?","Lynn Good","Paul, I think you know getting back to this range of cost that we've included on Slide 40, so we have $2.5 million and this is just North Carolina, $2.5 million on one and $10 billion on another end. So the more expedition of ash, that could arrive will increase the cost. Again, timeframe is important five years, 10 years, 15 years to accomplish that.","So I don't think, based on where we are right now. We can't give you any more specifics on, where we think it will end up, the legislation is been delayed and we will have more to report as it progresses.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, fair enough and I don't mean to focus too much on, but it seem to be, a lot of these costs would be rate peer oriented cost, right?","Lynn Good","We believe that cost recovery for ash is under the review of the Carolina's commission, but that again is something that would be addressed over time.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And we will now take our final question from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just wanted to clarify couple of comments, you made earlier. First off, Steve for planning purposes that 32% to 33% tax rate in 2014, should we assume roughly the same in the next couple of years as well?","Steve Young","No, I wouldn't try to be that precise as we go forward. We'll have to take allot each year at what's in front of us in terms of our tax optimization strategies and we'll give that year-by-year as we have in the past.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I see, so directionally though it could go up or down, is the way to think about it?","Steve Young","Well, it could yes, it could move, I don't think it would move dramatically either up or down, but I don't have any insight as to which direction, it might move at this point.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it and Lynn, just to be clear maybe you've said that and I may have missed that, but in your international review of all the options you're looking at, is a complete exit from international one of the options or is that off that table?","Lynn Good","I said before Ali, that all options are on the table, but as we approach the strategic review. We did not approach it with exited mind. We approached it, with an objective of trying to optimize the portfolio to pursue cash and more efficient use of cash and growth. So we always look at everything but, more to come as we complete our work and targeting end of this year or early next.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it and my last question, also just to clarify, when you talk about exiting the merchant and using the proceeds and so net impact being accretive, is that net impact embedded in the 4% to 6% or could that be upside assuming everything goes as plan?","Lynn Good","It contemplated in the range, Ali if you look at, I believe it would have been in first quarter. It's also on Slide 45 of this quarter's deck, you'll see sort of the makeup how we get to 4% to 6% and redeployment of proceeds is potential item to consider.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","I will now turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing comments.","Lynn Good","So thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to our third quarter call in early November and seeing many of you at the fall conference end of BEI [ph], so thanks again.","Operator","This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"8129":["Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  8, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Bryan Buckler - VP of IR","Lynn Good - President and CEO","Steven Young - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Praful Mehta - Citigroup","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Buckler","Thank you, Derek. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2019 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the safe harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on Slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on the quarter and progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends.","He will also provide an update on our regulatory and financing activities this year before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Bryan, thank you and good morning everyone. Today we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 compared to $1.65 in the prior-year. This represents 7% growth through the first three quarters, giving us confidence that we will look to the rest of the year. We have narrowed our 2019 EPS guidance range to $4.95 to $5.15 raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original range.","We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2023 of the midpoint of our original 2019 guidance range. 2019 is proven to be a solid year of growth for Duke Energy as we transform the customer experience and deliver value for our shareholders. We continue executing our strategy, making significant investments in the energy grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Let me highlight several operational accomplishments in the quarter on Slide 4.","First in early September, Hurricane Dorian, a historic Category 5 storm with an unpredictable path devastated the Bahamas before sweeping across the East Coast. Our thoughts remain with the people of the Bahamas as they continue the long journey to rebuild their communities and the days leading up to Dorian\u2019s potential landfall are weather forecasts and models projected significant outages to our Florida and Carolinas service territories. In response, we mobilized nearly 8,000 resources in Florida and over 10,000 resources in the Carolinas as we braced for the storm.","While Dorian\u2019s track shifted, it caused nearly 300,000 outages in our service territories, our teams preparation, commitment to our customers and focus on our operational excellence enabled us to restore more than 95% of the outages within 24 hours. Also, our systems and employees performed well in the face of some of the hottest days on record in September and early October. Despite these temperatures, our fleet performed well and serves customers with the energy they demand. In the quarter, Duke Energy was named one of the top sustainable companies in North America by Dow Jones for the 14th consecutive year. This is a testament to our climate strategy, sustainable practices and ongoing investments and cleaner generation.","In addition, Duke Energy received the U.S. Transparency award, which recognizes the quality and transparency of information the U.S. companies make available to investors. Duke Energy was awarded Best Corporate Disclosure for the utility industry. I'm proud of our employees and our operational execution during the quarter from storm preparation to industry recognitions, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our business and excel in our operations, which is fundamental to achieving our long-term strategy.","Turning to Slide 5 in September, we announced a more aggressive comprehensive strategy to reduce carbon emissions. By 2030, we will cut carbon emissions by at least 50% from 2005 levels, and aspire to attain net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our commitment for 2030 includes plant retirement, operating our existing carbon free resources, and investing in natural gas infrastructure, renewables and our energy delivery system.","Our recent rate case filings in Indiana and the Carolinas are consistent with this accelerated approach. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free dispatchable resources that includes longer-term energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture, and zero carbon fuels. We will also pursue second license renewal for all of our nuclear assets to maintain this low cost, carbon-free source of generation.","The journey and timeline for achieving our targets will be different in each state. And we're committed to working with our regulators and other stakeholders to design the right path for our customers and communities. Making our energy system cleaner and more sustainable means, we must transform the way we operate. And we're facing that challenge head on. We've made great progress and our acceleration in this area will position the company to provide customers with a cleaner, smarter energy future. The investments shown on Slide 6 are also consistent with our climate strategy. Our Ashville combined cycle plan is on track to be completed by the end of the year. This plant is part of our $1.1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project that supports this growing region.","Also in North Carolina the second renewable energy RFP under House Bill 589 launched in mid-October. The RFP seeks another 680 megawatts of solar projects, which would bring the total renewables under the program to almost 1,200 megawatts. We look forward to participating in this next phase of the process.","As a reminder, in Florida, we will be installing 700 megawatts of solar by 2022 as part of our multi-year settlement agreement. Today, the Commission has improved the recovery of 344 megawatts under the solar base rate adjustment mechanisms.","Focusing on our commercial renewables business, we had another impressive quarter. So far this year, we've announced over 1,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects, including nearly 400 megawatts announced in the third quarter. Given our pipeline of investments, we have line of sight nearly all of our growth prospects for 2019 and 2020 and 70% over the five-year plan.","Shifting to our gas business on Slide 7, let me update you on the status of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In early October, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted our petition to review the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Appalachian Trail crossing decision. This is a very encouraging sign and provides the path forward to resolve this important issue. We expect the Supreme Court will schedule arguments for early next year, with a final decision no later than mid-2020.","As a reminder, the Solicitor General has joined our appeal, and we are supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders including 16 State Attorneys General, we believe the law in fact are on our side and look forward to moving toward a final resolution. We also continue to work with project partners and the Fish and Wildlife Service on the biological opinion, an incidental take statement to resolve the issues identified by the Fourth Circuit.","Based on early discussions, we now expect the permits to be issued in the first half of 2020. While this is later than previously anticipated, all parties are keenly focused on delivering reissue permits that are robust enough to minimize the potential for further appeal. This timing also aligns more closely with the expected Supreme Court decision providing more clarity before we pursue full construction activities.","Given this timeline for the resolution of the Appalachian Trail Crossing and the biological opinion, we are no longer pursuing a phased approach, but are now planning for mechanical completion of the project in late 2021 with full-in service in the first half of 2022.","On the customer front, the ACP project partners have advanced discussions on the project status and costs and we expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year balancing price and project returns. We believe this pipeline remains the best option to meet our customers needs.","We remain committed to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the significant benefits that will bring to our customers and our region. It will provide much needed natural gas to an underserved area of the Southeast and will allow us to retire coal units and replace them with cleaner burning natural gas fired plants to help meet our carbon reduction targets. In addition, it supports critical resiliency need for some of the country's most important military outposts.","At the same time, as we execute on our $37 billion growth capital plan that underlies our 4% to 6% earnings growth rate, we have consistently stated our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Given ACP progress and clarity on important milestones, which includes the delay in project revenues until early to mid-2022, we are increasing the amount of equity in our plan.","We plan to monitor market conditions and issue approximately $2.5 billion opportunistically by the end of 2020. This additional equity allows us to absorb a wide range of outcomes associated with ACP, while also offering greater financial flexibility to the company. For instance, after ACP comes online, we will have the ability to moderate our current assumptions of $500 million per year in DRIP and ATM issuances. Additionally, we see emerging infrastructure needs for our expansive energy delivery system, which may require incremental investments in which would drive additional growth beyond our existing $37 billion growth capital plan.","We believe this issuance keeps us moving forward as we deliver value to our customers and results for our shareholders. We remain confident in our ability to achieve 4% to 6% earnings growth through 2023 given our healthy franchises and strong investment growth profile. Steve will discuss more details about our growth drivers in a moment.","Circling back to ACP, I'm pleased with the progress we've made to advance this important infrastructure project. While this is a lengthy process we're committed to the project and its completion and we will continue to share details as we learn more.","Moving to Slide 8, let me share a few updates about recent legislative developments. Earlier this week, Senate Bill 559 was enacted into law in North Carolina, enabling the Utilities Commission to approve storm costs securitization. This important mechanism will save customers 15% to 20% on storm costs and support our balance sheet. We\u2019re pleased with the General Assembly's unanimous vote on securitization, and also the bipartisan support for other costs recovery mechanisms that we advocated for, such as multi-year rate plans and ROE band.","While the final bill does not include these other provisions, Governor Cooper's Clean Energy Plan speaks to the potential for modernized recovery mechanisms for the State, we are encouraged that these important reforms are part of the broader energy policy dialog, and we will actively participate in the 2020 stakeholder engagement process related to the Clean Energy Plan.","Changes to the regulatory construct are a vital part of achieving North Carolina's energy objectives in the long-term. We are focused on advancing modern mechanisms and the customer benefits they provide. In the near-term, our attention will be on the execution of frequent rate cases and pursuing solutions to reduce regulatory lag. Both are important to delivering customer benefits and meeting our earnings objectives.","We have operated in North Carolina for more than a century providing our customers with safe and reliable power. The state is thriving with a strong economy and increasing demand for new energy infrastructure. As we look ahead, we share many of the state's objectives and will partner with stakeholders to develop innovative solutions and thoughtful energy policy.","Energy policy discussions are also advancing in many of our other states and stakeholders are embracing the value of improving the grid. In Ohio, Health Bill 247 is progressing through the legislature. This bill would further grid modernization distributed generation and other investments to benefit customers.","And in Florida, recently enacted legislation promotes grid hardening investment that will improve the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events, while establishing rider recovery for the investments. The Florida Public Service Commission is finalizing rulemaking and we expect to file our storm protection plan in 2020. With over 300,000 line miles across our utilities, our transmission and distribution network is the largest in the nation, and the demands in our energy delivery system have never been greater. This requires significant capital investment to ensure our communities keep pace with the energy transformation occurring across the nation. We\u2019re excited to work with stakeholders across all of our electric and gas service territories to ensure the pace and scale of our investments align with customer needs.","Before turning it over to Steve, I want to reiterate our strong confidence in our long-term strategy and our continued ability to deliver on our commitments. We're taking necessary steps to maintain the strength of our balance sheet advocating for solutions across our jurisdictions and making progress as we advance our investment priorities to benefit our customers and shareholders. As we move into the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out a very strong year. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven Young","Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results on Slide 9, including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior-year. For detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported basis, 2019 third quarter earnings per share were $1.82 compared to a $1.51 last year. Third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were $1.79 compared to $1.65 last year.","The difference between 2019 reported and adjusted earnings was due to a reduction in an open impairment charge originally recorded in 2018. This benefit has been reflected as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings. For the quarter, higher adjusted results compared to the prior-year were primarily due to growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities, favorable weather and lower O&M expenses.","These items were partially offset by higher financing costs. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.25 compared to the prior-year. Higher results were driven by base rate increases across multiple utilities, more favorable weather and higher rider revenues, including recovery of our Midwest grid investments. O&M was also favorable in the quarter. During September, Hurricane Dorian impacted our Florida and Carolinas utilities.","We estimate total cost for Hurricane Dorian as approximately $400 million, including $150 million in Florida. We deferred the majority of these costs and we request recovery through regulatory proceedings at DEP and DEF in the coming months. Similar to previous hurricane costs, such as Florence, a portion of the Dorian costs are not eligible for recovery. While Hurricane Dorian restoration costs impacted our quarterly results, we incurred higher costs in the third quarter of 2018 for a net favorable effect this quarter.","We also continue to excel at controlling traditional O&M costs, exceeding our own targeted savings for the quarter. While we expect some of the O&M favorability to turn in the fourth quarter due to timing, it is clear our digital and efficiency efforts are producing real savings. I will speak more about our capabilities in this area in a moment. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and slightly lower retail volumes.","Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.01 in the quarter, largely due to growth from our Midstream investments. While we did see growth in our LDC businesses from an increase in customers, we expect these businesses to have a strong earnings contribution in the fourth quarter due to seasonality.","In commercial renewable, results were up $0.02 driven by favorable wind resource and growth from our new projects. The other segment was down $0.11 for the quarter, largely due to higher financing costs and timing of income tax expense recognition in the current year.","We continue to expect our full-year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 12% and 14%. Finally, share dilution drove a $0.03 decline given we issued shares in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. We are very pleased with our results so far this year delivering 7% growth on a year-to-date basis. This execution gives us confidence that we will achieve full-year results within our narrowed 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.95 to $5.15.","Turning into Slide 10, we operate in jurisdictions with strong customer and business growth fueled by steady population migration. In the third quarter, we saw a pause in the volume growth we experienced in recent quarters, driven primarily by the industrial sector.","On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was negative 0.5%. Within the residential class, we continue to experience outstanding customer growth in each of our territories with an overall increase of 1.6% in 2019. Company sponsored energy efficiency programs for which we are compensated have contributed to the decline in recent residential usage per customer.","Residential results in the quarter were also likely impacted by Hurricane Dorian. These factors together resulted in relatively flat residential volumes for the rolling 12-month period. In the commercial class, sales were down 0.6% over the rolling 12-months. Results were impacted by greater adoption of our energy efficiency programs and Big Box retail closures. These were partially offset by an uptick in data center expansions and strength in the medical services segment.","Finally, sales in our industrial class declined 1.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Lower industrial volumes were driven by manufacturing contractions and the weakening global economy. A few singular industrial closings and manufacturing outages further influenced the rolling 12-month average. We believe these specific outliers will improve as we move forward.","Overall, our strong customer growth attractive jurisdictions and business diversity up to mitigate broader macroeconomic headwinds. We expect to end the year flat to last year and recall this follows growth in 2018 of almost 1%, we\u2019ll continue to monitor economic trends and impacts on our sales volumes and will provide updates on our February call.","Turning to Slide 11, let me update you on our active regulatory calendar. We filed rate cases for DEC and DEP in North Carolina in September and October respectively. We are seeking recovery for investments in cleaner generation infrastructure, grid modernization projects and accelerated depreciation of certain coal units. We request also include recovery of coal ash remediation spend and deferred storm costs. Now that the storm securitization bill is law, we will seek to securitize the North Carolina portion of these costs, which will reduce the rate impact to our customers.","Both cases proposed a 10.3% ROE and 53% equity component of the capital structure. Evidentiary hearings for the DEC case are set to begin in March 2020. We expect revised rates for both DEC and DEP to be effective in the third quarter 2020.","Moving to Piedmont Natural Gas, we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the settlement in the North Carolina rate case which was approved on October 31. Under the agreement, Piedmont is allowed a 9.7% ROE and 52% equity capital structure. Piedmont also received approval of a 9.9% ROE and 55% equity capital structure in their recent South Carolina annual regulatory filing.","Turning to our other utilities, we continue to work through rate case proceedings at Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky with hearings expected in the first quarter of 2020 in both cases, we have a robust regulatory strategy that has enabled us to consistently secure recovery of investments we make on behalf of our customers.","Our regulators understand the importance of the work we do to serve our communities while also maintaining healthy utilities in their regions. We will continue this important work as we close out 2019 and move into 2020. Shifting to Slide 12, our strategy is focused on delivering value to customers through investments, in clean energy, natural gas and grid infrastructure underscored by a $37 billion growth capital plan through 2023.","As Lynn mentioned, and as we have previously emphasized, we are committed to maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and are taking proactive steps to ensure our credit metrics remain strong. With ACP\u2019s projected revenues delayed until 2022, we intend to issue approximately $2.5 billion of equity by the end of 2020. This will align proceeds with the timing of ACP construction activities and help avoid unnecessary dilution in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, dilution will be offset by increased ACP earnings given we are no longer pursuing a phase-in approach, AFUDC will accrue on the entire balance until full commissioning occurs, providing an earnings uplift during construction. This additional equity strengthens the company's credit profile, provide sufficient balance sheet strength to absorb a wide range of outcomes associated with ACP.","We continue to expect equity issuances of $500 million per year through 2022 via the DRIP and ATM programs for a total of approximately $4 billion of equity issuances over this three-year period, compared to our previous plans of $1.5 billion during this time period. However, after ACP comes on law, this additional equity will provide us the balance sheet flexibility to moderate or eliminate annual equity issuances, or deploy additional capital towards regulated investments.","Let's turn to Slide 13 where I'd like to highlight approximately 5.5% growth we've seen in our core electric and gas segments this year, which includes financing costs at the holding company. This is on top of the adjusted 5.5%","growth we saw for these businesses in 2018 versus 2017. These results have been driven by execution on our $37 billion growth capital plan and top notch O&M cost control efforts, highlighting the outstanding electric and gas service territories in which we operate and giving us great confidence as we look to 2020 and beyond.","With that, let's move to Slide 14 to discuss primary growth drivers for next year. I'll start with 2020 drivers in the Electric Utilities segment. In Florida, we will continue to recover our grid investments through the second base rate increase in our multi-year rate plan. We also expect growth from additional solar projects we covered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. In the Carolinas, we have a full-year of benefit of the South Carolina rate increases that went into effect in June, we\u2019ll have partial years contribution from the North Carolina rate cases filed this year as well as increased wholesale earnings due to improved pricing.","In the Midwest, we\u2019ll see the impacts of our Indiana and Kentucky rate cases and will continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs.","Shifting to the gas segment, we will see higher AFUDC earnings from ACP given we expect construction activities to resume in 2020, once key permits are reissued. The LDC business will see growth from Piedmont\u2019s rate cases, customer additions and continued investments in integrity management and power generation infrastructure.","Our commercial renewable segment will be largely flat to 2019. But as Lynn mentioned, we have line of sight substantially all our growth prospects for 2020 and 70% over the five-year plan. In addition to a long utility driven runway for investment, our demonstrated cost control capabilities will remain an important tool to achieve our growth objectives. Our track record of cost management has been outstanding. Since 2015, we have actually lowered non-recoverable O&M from $4.9 billion to $4.8 billion.","This includes absorbing $300 million of O&M from the Piedmont acquisition in 2016 in addition to offsetting wage and salary increases in general inflation. In 2019, we continue to take advantage of our scope and scale by investing in digital capabilities and data analytics, which are creating sustainable cost savings. For example, we established an IDEA Lab earlier this year, we have nearly 400 people at this facility who are dedicated to developing digital applications and other solutions to benefit operations every day. In less than a year, they have put more than 20 applications into the field. We know these capabilities will serve us well over our long-term planning horizon.","Beyond 2020, we expect dilution from the $2.5 billion equity issuance to occur beginning in 2021. This will be offset by increased eight ACP earnings. We are no longer pursuing a phase-in approach and therefore AFUDC will improve on the entire balance throughout the construction period, providing an earnings uplift in 2021 and 2022.","Many of the drivers, I just described will also support earnings growth in 2021, such as the Florida multi-year rate plan and SOBRA investments. Full-year rate case impacts in North Carolina, Indiana and Kentucky, as well as continued grid investments in the Midwest utilities. Longer-term, we expect significant investment opportunity from storm hardening legislation and solar demand in Florida, the growing need for cleaner generation and energy delivery infrastructure in the Carolinas and new gas distribution infrastructure across our footprint.","These drivers give us confidence in our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate through 2023. Consistent with our historical practice, we will provide 2020 earnings guidance and our growth prospects for future years during our February financial update.","I'll close with Slide 15, we are having a fantastic 2019 is illustrated by another strong quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as those are attractive investor value proposition that is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields 4%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent, low risk investments, we offer a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long-term investment opportunity.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, good morning guys.","Lynn Good","Hi, Shar.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just on the - couple questions here. On the equity that was just announced, curious on your thoughts on the timing, especially without knowing the viability of ACP. So can you run into a situation where you issue or commit to the equity and SCOTUS to further appeal somehow deal a blow to the project. Do you sort of need the equity if ACP is ultimately cancelled? And then I'm just curious on how Steve you're thinking about the method on the equity hybrid, ","convertible, forwards?","Lynn Good","And Shar, I will take that. I think this has been a journey on this project, as you know. And we really looked at the progress made in this quarter that provided us some clarity on a couple of important milestones. So certainly SCOTUS taking the case was important for us to have greater confidence and getting over the trail.","And then the fact that we've continued discussions on the biological opinion, discussions with our customers and contractors, all of that taken together, we concluded that targeting a single in-service date at the end of 2021 with completion, mechanical completion in 2021, full-completion in 2022 was the right approach, balancing customer benefits, construction efficiencies and all of those things and so as we reach those milestones, we thought looking at financing was also appropriate. And as we looked at financing, we did consider a range of outcomes on this project.","We\u2019re committed to completing the project. But I think the fact that we have had challenges along the way makes us clear eyed about evaluating the range of outcomes. We also believe this approach supports the $37 billion capital we're funding in the rest of our regulated business. And with getting the equity out there, we do have flexibility with our DRIP and ATM in the future, if circumstances indicate that we could moderate that and we have additional investments that we could put forward.","So we thought it was appropriate in light of the events that occurred this quarter, Shar to de-risk our plan, get the balance sheet in good shape, move forward, as we have said on Atlantic Coast pipeline, and really feel like the plan itself is a solid one that represents good growth for investors.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. So with or without -- sorry, sorry, please go ahead.","Steven Young","I was just going to say regarding the mechanism, we've got plenty of time to do this equity. So there are as you mentioned, a number of tools out there we will be looking at that and seeing what makes the most sense for us, but nothing further beyond that at this point.","Shahriar Pourreza","So with our without ACP, the capital program, you have necessitates the needs for equity, with or without ACP, I think?","Lynn Good","Shar, what I would say is we have already invested almost $2 billion in ACP. And we are continuing to advance the project in light of the developments that have occurred. And so this equity is really to strengthen the balance sheet through that construction period, also supporting the capital growth. And we do have ability to the DRIP, DRIP and ATM to moderate if we think that makes sense in the future. But we were -- we thought it was appropriate to look at financing and de-risk the balance Sheet at this stage in light of the progress that we've made.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then just lastly on Senate Bill 559, obviously as you highlighted, it\u2019s signed into law but it was obviously missing the key piece of the proposal around multi-year planning, ROE band, et cetera. Curious on why this was removed, especially given the Governor's kind of Clean Energy Plan, which was submitted earlier this year and included the possibilities of these mechanisms.","So he obviously understands the importance. So I'm curious why that ultimately was removed. And I have to envision the stakeholder process in the Governor's Clean Energy Plan is going to be much more involved. So if you can give us a little bit of a sense on timing, that would be great.","Lynn Good","Appreciate that, Shar. And I think the fact that the Clean Energy Plan gives recognition to regulatory modernization is a good thing. But the clean energy plan also includes carbon reductions of up to 70%, of greenhouse gas emission reductions up to 70% also talks about retirement of uneconomic coal plant, grid support for clean energy. So it does bring in a number of other topics. And I think the spirit of the stakeholder process will be to address not only the modernized regulatory construct, but some of these other items. And as we look at the plan, in light of our climate strategy, we see a great deal of alignment on how we would like to go forward and believe will be an important part of delivering the solutions that the Governor lays out in the clean energy plan.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Thanks guys. I'll jump back in. Thank you so much.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Shar.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi Lynn and Steve.","Lynn Good","Hi Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Hey can you eliminate further on reasons for delays at U.S. Fish and Wildlife into the first half of 2020, do this and does the move away from a phase-in approach simply mean that there's just no appetite among off takers for that Phase 1 alternative that had been discussed previously?","Lynn Good","Let me take that in two parts, Michael. So the discussions are underway with Fish and Wildlife. We are taking a look at all of the feedback from the Fourth Circuit evaluating next step. There's been extensive work done as you know, additional surveys of the Bumblebee and the Clubshell Mussel and the intent of all of the parties is to address those concerns in a way that reduces any additional risks associated with remand from that permit.","So we believe it could be issued ss early as wintertime, we keep our eye on that tree-clearing window as you know, to try to get trees cleared if we can before the 1st of March. But given our timeline with the Appalachian Trail, we can also accommodate slipping a little further in 2020.","I think in terms of the phased-in approach, we have continued discussion throughout this project with customers and also monitoring all of the developments that have occurred, including these permit challenges, et cetera and the greatest value for our customers is the complete project because they're trying to get to that supply basin, and also infrastructure diversity and to the Eastern part of the state. And so that single project is where our customers see the greatest value.","And I also believe with our timing that the construction efficiencies of building it in a single phase also make a great deal of sense. So we've got some alignment, and with that movement to revenue in 2022, that was a driver as well as we thought about our financing plan.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And one last one, has there been any change to the approximate 2% dividend growth expectation? I know you have a commitment to dividend growth. But just wondering if this equity issuance makes any change to that?","Lynn Good","Michael, we will reevaluate in connection with guidance in February. But I think that's a reasonable planning assumption for now. We see that as an opportunity and a way for us to moderate our payout ratio to be more in line with our industry peers. And the combination of all these things puts us in a very strong position to execute our growth plans.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","Congrats on having a really strong year this year.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Gordon","As it pertains to ACP, with the phased-in, with the lack of a phased-in approach, you would be booking the full AFUDC rate until the project goes into service, so I can see how that has an accretive effect to earnings in 2021 and sort of as an offset to the increased share count. But when it goes into service and you start collecting the actual cash revenues based on the current contract rate, given that the project is coming in at $7.5 billion when the initial service costs was estimated to be in the mid-5s, not that you're alone, there's lots of pipes that are having this issue, shouldn't the return on the pipe unless you're able to negotiate some pass-through of those cost overruns go, that the cash earnings will be lower than the AFUDC rate unless you were able to get contract relief. Is that the right assumption?","Lynn Good","Greg, I think it's important to recognize that we had been in conversations with customers all along the way on the status of the project and also the cost. And we do expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year that provides the right balance between customer price and returns. So we have said a number of times that the actual executed return on this project will be a regulated like return and we believe that continues to be a fair planning assumption. I think the AFUDC rate is higher about 14%. But we believe the in-service rate will be a very good regulated return.","Greg Gordon","Okay, so you believe you'll be able to negotiate a balanced outcome where the aftertax ROE on the pipe on the current, on the new construction cost will look like a good regulated return?","Lynn Good","I think it's -- it'll be a balanced outcome. And Greg, the business case for this pipe has remained unchanged. If I look at it from the perspective of Duke Energy, the need for additional firm transport into the Carolinas is unchanged and increasing as time continues. And so this pipe in its entirety represents an extraordinary opportunity for us to position the Southeast for decades to come and our customers recognize that and the same as the case in Virginia and that Eastern part of Virginia. So I think what often gets overlooked is that there's a fundamental need for this pipe because of the demand in the region.","Greg Gordon","No doubt about that. Thank you, Lynn.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will next go to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning, Lynn and Steve.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Turnure","Obviously, the markets are doing well and utilities are doing well in terms of stock price performance. I'm wondering if part of your plans included evaluating asset sales in lieu of doing equity. And then, I guess, tied to that question, is part of your decision to do this size of equity tied to the strong market performance?","Lynn Good","Yes, Chris, it's a good question. And from our history, we have monetized assets over time, including as recently as a joint venture partner into our commercial renewables business. So we have evaluated that. We believe that our portfolio, we like our portfolio, it's delivering value, it's growing, we have great investment opportunities. So our intent is to pursue this equity need through a security through the markets as opposed to an asset disposition. And so we'll evaluate the timing opportunistically as Steve mentioned, and believe that\u2019s going to position the company well for growth in the future.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then is it fair on the equity issuance to assume that the full amount of the $2-plus billion would hit your share count by the end of next year through cost infrastructure or others?","Steven Young","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Lynn Good","Yes, that\u2019s fair planning assumption.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then, Lynn, you started to address this in a prior question, but just the Governor's plan in North Carolina, kind of what it means for the future, seems like it's a good thing for you guys and your ability to invest in the state and further the goals there. But is there any more detail that you can provide us on next steps and your efforts to get lower regulatory lag and more visibility into your regulatory recovery?","Lynn Good","Sure. And I guess I\u2019ll take that in two ways. Chris, on regulatory lag, we have that assignment regardless of what happens to the clean energy plan and we\u2019ll accomplish through deferrals, through capital optimization, through timing our rate case as well and you can expect us to continue to focus on that very keenly. But as it pertains to the clean energy plan, early discussions are already underway. The Department of Environmental Quality in the state is overseeing this process, we would expect stakeholder workshop to kick-off even as early as the end of this year, but continuing into 2020.","And there were probably a half dozen stakeholder processes during the course of 2019 in preparation for the issuance of the plan. So it's already building some momentum. And as you noted, and as I said, we see a lot of alignment between our climate strategy and what the Governor is trying to accomplish. And I've looked at where we are in North Carolina with over 30% reduction in carbon emissions already close to 35%. Our IRP plan puts us between 50% and 55% already by 2030.","North Carolina is second in the nation in installed solar capacity, over 50% of the energy comes from carbon free sources. We're looking to second license renewal on nuclear. So there are a number of strategic things that I think line up well with us and so we\u2019ll be very interested in continuing that discussion in 2020 with the clean energy plan stakeholder process.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. Is there a point in time at which those stakeholder discussions move to the Utility Commission? Or is that kind of too far out to tell?","Lynn Good","I think it\u2019s too far out to tell. Chris, I do think just getting back to part of it. So we have in front of the commission right now accelerated retirements of coal in connection with our rate case. So we'll have an opportunity to advance that discussion. It's consistent with the clean energy plan over the course of our rate case, and you can expect to see testimony along those lines. So there will be advances consistent with that plan during 2020. I will of course keep you informed about the stakeholder process as it unfolds.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks Lynn.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hey good morning, Lynn.","Lynn Good","Hi Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, so just could you just remind us the commercial renewables business, just given the increase projects you've had there, how much you're going to end-up investing in that business, roughly this year and maybe next year?","Lynn Good","Steve will take that.","StevenYoung","Yes, Steve. I think will be in the range of $1 billion this year. It'll be lesser amounts as we go forward, still in line with the five-year plan of roughly $2.5 billion investments or about $1 billion this year.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, okay and then switching back to kind of the news today on the equity and the like, so just maybe trying to ignore the exact timing by year but just overall if we still have ACP coming on, which was in the before. But there is now $2.5 billion of additional equity. Can you just maybe better explain how that still keep you in the same growth like what else is an offset? Is it just better performance in some of the other businesses?","Lynn Good","Steve, I think we should take that kind of break that down a little bit. So let's talk about the construction period of ACP. We have moved away from the phased-in approach with a plan now for the project to go into mechanical completion in 2021, full-in service in 2022. So with this change, we will be accruing allowance for funds for a longer period of time on the full project than what we had previously considered, where we were putting part of the 60% or so of the project in service at the end of 2020 and then the rest in service at the end of 2021.","So that gives us additional earnings during the construction period, that will offset dilution from the equity. And then as we go post in-service, we are working actively with customers, as I said a moment ago to reach agreement, we believe in principle by the end of the year to find a balance between construction costs and returns on the project that would be consistent with revenues that would come into service in 2022.","And then I think Steve, kind of outlined on Slide 14 of the deck, a very comprehensive set of drivers that are driving growth in the regulated businesses and I believe we have consistently delivered within our growth range on the regulated businesses and we see even more potential with the Florida legislation, with the Ohio legislation, with the clean energy plan being outlined in the Carolinas. And so as we come to the Street in February, we\u2019ll be giving you some more visibility and where we see additional growth. And we think the combination of all of these things give us confidence that we can remain within the range of 4% to 6% of our planning period.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, I think I got it, thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much, hi guys.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So maybe coming back to the equity but looking at it more from the credit side, it seems like there's a little bit of surprise around the need of equity. And it seems to be stemming more from a credit pressure that you're seeing potentially from the agencies, you had a sale earlier in the year. Now you're doing more equity, even despite sounds like where ACP goes from a timing perspective. So just wanted to understand, so we have a better kind of framework. What is the credit situation right now? What are the rating agencies saying? I mean, is there like a minimum threshold you're trying to hit, just so we get, what's driving the fundamental equity need?","Lynn Good","And Praful, I'll try to do it and Steve can chime in as well. I think it's important to focus on cash flow and when we move in-service date, a full-year, that means we're foregoing cash flow in 2021, and part of 2022 in Atlantic Coast Pipeline and that is substantial cash flow driver.","We\u2019re committed, as we said to our metrics, we're targeting FFO to debt of 15% to 16%. We think that is appropriate and consistent with the way the agencies look at us. You know that Moody's has us on stable, S&P has us on negative outlook, really looking not only ACP, but a number of other developments in our regulated business. And so I would look at this is us being responsive to developments that have occurred around an important project and consistent with our commitment to the balance sheet, which we have been clear about all along.","So combination together is the way I would think about this equity issuance. And I'll look to Steve to see if he would add?","Steven Young","Yes, I would echo that entirely and we certainly want to have a solid balance sheet and the measure you think about there is a 50% FFO. And so we want to make sure that we can attain that. And as Lynn said, a delay of a project of this magnitude has a lot of cash flow implications. And so we want to be mindful of that and be proactive. And I think this will give us flexibility on the back-end of things as well.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's very helpful context. Appreciate that. And then maybe just quickly on coal ash and the DQE order. Just what is the current status of the appeal on that? Is there anything that you can share on the process there, I know you're expecting it to go well into 2020 as you reference on your slides, but just wanted to see how to think about that, that process?","Lynn Good","Praful, it is still moving forward. We\u2019re pursuing appeal through the OAH and also the North Carolina Superior Court. Our appeals are focused, or our claims are focused not only on the process that led to the decision, but also the substance of the decision. And so that process continues and as we reach milestones, we will of course update on that. But that's where I would leave it at this point.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Finally, just on Florida, clearly positive in terms of the Senate Bill 796 and the authority around good investment, any color on opportunities to further increase your CapEx associated with this? I know you said you're evaluating everything that comes out of it. But how should we think about that and timing around what this could result in terms of incremental CapEx?","Lynn Good","Sure. And Praful the Florida has been an environment that is recognized the need for grid investments. And we have been investing in hardening of our grid for some time. Right now, as part of our multi-year rate plan, we have over a $1 billion of investment underway. And that plan runs through 2021, so we would see the potential to take advantage of this additional storm hardening as we look at resetting our multi-year rate plan for 2022 and forward, which gives us an opportunity to really put additional investment to work in Florida.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Well, thanks so much guys.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning, Lynn and team.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, so I'm going to try to follow-up on some of the prior questions here a little bit more specifically, I believe in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit more about additional distribution and infrastructure spend resulting from the equity raise as well as dealing with ACP. And I understand that ACP is to a large extent at least at present, a timing-related issue. Can you elaborate on potential opportunities on that side in tandem with this capital raise to kind of think about and I know, we're a little bit ahead of the 4Q cycle to discuss that, but I just wanted to kind of dig in a little further on sort of the twin purposes at least disclosed for the capital raise and understand also maybe at the same time, relative to that 15% FFO to debt, where do you stand and how much latitude do you have in your metrics to see some of that cash flow degradation at the outset that you described from the delay in ACP?","Lynn Good","So let me talk about grid investment first and then we can get to metrics Julien, what I would say on grid investment is we see an increasing interest in investment in the grid throughout our service territory. Florida, we talked about a moment ago Praful had questions around the Florida legislation.","We also referenced Ohio, there's a Health Bill 247 that's moving through in Ohio. We've got TDSIC in Indiana, that has been an important investment opportunity and then the Clean Energy Plan that will progress in the Carolinas in 2020 also has a specific focus on modernizing the grid to support clean energy resilience, and other initiatives.","So we feel like there's just a lot of policy discussion around the grid that will give us an opportunity to continue to add capital in a way that delivers benefits to customers and also benefits to shareholders. I think the timing of how that rolls out will be jurisdiction by jurisdiction, I would think about Florida's being 2022.","Ohio, I think we have to get the bill passed yet to see where that's going to lie. And then we'll progress on the Clean Energy Plan during 2020 in the Carolinas, and have a better sense of where that capital will be deployed. Within our $37 million, we already have a fair amount of capital that's underway and we\u2019ll of course continue to execute that.","On metrics, we should close 2019 at 15% and Steve, why don't you talk about what you see in 2020 and 2021?","Steven Young","Right, we should be at 15% and as we move forward, we\u2019ll be in the 15% range and the equity issuance and advancements of other efforts in rate cases should start to drive us north of 15% as we move into 2020, 2021 and beyond. And that's our goal is to be in the 15% to 16% range. That would give us sufficient headroom to deal with the types of things that pop-up, such as hurricanes or other issues.","And we think that'll give us sufficient flexibility in our financial plan with this equity. And as we said earlier, if things can work out with Atlantic Coast Pipeline coming on, we have the opportunity to ramp-back on the ATM or to invest in the type of infrastructure that Lynn alluded to. There's a lot of opportunities out there.","So that's basically the plan to get north of 15% in the 15% to 16% range, and we'll be doing that as we move through 2021 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Can you quickly elaborate just in terms of the 2020 dynamics, specifically you alluded to a flat clean infrastructure renewable contribution next year, and I think if I understand it, right, the equity capital should have a minimal impact next year as well just based on timing, but I don't want to put words in your mouth on that. And then maybe\u2026","Lynn Good","Yes, the minimal dilution in 2020, commercial renewables will be flat and the drivers that Steve outlined, I think it's Slide 14, Julien are very comprehensive. So I think you can track through those in a way that gives you a lot of confidence on 2020.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, confidence as in the current trajectory?","Lynn Good","Yes.","Steven Young","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes, all right, great. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, couple of questions. First of all, on the commercial renewable side, how are you thinking about investment going forward, meaning in 2021, I get you'd love to do more at the utilities. I'm just curious, trying to get my arms around your plans when you're thinking about the next couple of years?","Steven Young","Well, we\u2019ll roll out and update our capital plan in February, as you know, Michael. But we had laid out last February about $2.5 billion of capital through 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we're doing about a $1 billion this year, it'll be lesser amounts going forward, I think we'll be deploying an amount of capital that will keep the earnings profile, relatively flat in the $200 million range is what we're looking at.","I'd mentioned earlier that to keep that profile going forward, we need to land to 300 megawatts a year of projects, given the earnings profile, and so forth. So I don't see the capital proportionally growing in this particular segment as we go forward, but there will be capital as we land a few new projects each year.","Lynn Good","And then, Michael, like, Florida solar is directly in the regulated capital plan. So the 700 megawatts that we're building there. And to the extent we build any of the CPRE and the regulated utility in the Carolinas, that capital would be in the regulated capital plan.","Michael Lapides","Thank you for that. Just one follow-up though, can you how much of a benefit occurred in 2019 earnings so far that are impacting tax that are related to ITC benefits you took for projects that came online this year?","Steven Young","Well, a lot of the growth that we saw and targeted for commercial renewables was from solar projects and those that profitability is driven by the tax benefits. And when we close tax partnership arrangements there, you recognize a lot of the tax benefits. So we've got $139 million of net income so far this year. We've got a combination of some wind and solar projects, the solar projects in particular hit the earnings early.","Lynn Good","Michael, I think it's important to recognize that these projects are locked in for 2019 and 2020. And we are committed to a flat trajectory, around $200 million of net income over the five-year period and 70% of that is already committed in our pipeline. So it's an important part of this business. But I think in terms of the volatility, or any volatility, you could expect, this is an area that we feel like we have very well developed and managed.","Steven Young","And I would also add that the projects that will be landing prospectively starting in 2020, will utilize a structure that we believe will have a more of the spread of earnings recognition over a three to five year time periods.","Michael Lapides","Thank you. No, I appreciate that. I was just trying to think about is there, I don't know like an EPS not cliff, but an EPS draft, if you do fewer projects in the next couple of years than you're doing this year in 2019. And therefore you have less kind of one-time tax benefits in those future years?","Lynn Good","I think you should include in your model roughly $200 million to $220 million of net income for the next five years, because that's what we have in ours, that we're committed to deliver.","Michael Lapides","Okay, and then one final, final item. Just curious, given this new kind of financing need, how you're thinking about M&A? I mean, obviously, there's some situations that are very public out there, municipals or cooperatives being sold in both Florida and South Carolina. But does the -- the balance sheet constraint in the credit metrics requiring the new equity does that change your view at all on kind of broader sector M&A, or asset M&A?","Lynn Good","No, we think about what we talked about today, Michael is within the construct of a very robust organic growth plan, that includes strong regulated investment, $37 billion of growth capital. I think you're talking about Santee Cooper or perhaps JEA. We are involved in those processes. We know both of those assets well, and we would evaluate those on whether or not it makes sense to be a part of that process going forward and whether we believe we can deliver value to shareholders. So we think about that as a separate and distinct analysis that we will accomplish in a way that makes sense.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Lynn, thanks Steve. Much appreciate you all.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions today. I\u2019d like to pass the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","Great, well thank you everyone for your questions and your interest and investment in Duke. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the next few days. So thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s call. Again we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7830":["Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May  7, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Bill Currens - Vice President, Investor Relations","Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer","Steve Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Keith Trent - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Regulated Utilities","Analysts","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Chris Turnure - JPMorgan","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead.","Bill Currens - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Kay. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings review and business update.","Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance.","Leading our call today is Lynn Good, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks on the topics outlined on Slide 3, we will take your questions. Other members of the executive management team will be available during this portion of the call.","Now, I will turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Duke Energy\u2019s value proposition, as outlined on Slide 4, has remained consistent over time. We strive for excellence in our day-to-day operations and to deliver affordable and reliable services to our customers while leveraging our competitive advantages, including the additional capabilities we gained from the merger with Progress Energy in 2012. This focus gives us opportunities to deliver attractive returns to our investors through long-term earnings per share growth as well as the dividends. Our financial objectives have remained consistent over time and we have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments.","I am very pleased with our overall strong first quarter. We reported first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17 supported by revised customer rates and strong weather normalized retail customer load growth. These results leave us on track to achieve our previously announced 2014 guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60. We responded well operationally to challenging winter weather conditions and the Dan River ash discharge. I want to thank our dedicated team of employees who worked for these challenging conditions with great discipline and resolve. Before I turn the call over to Steve for more detail on the quarter, I would like to provide some business updates, review the status of our strategic initiatives in our commercial businesses, and discuss our progress on our growth investment opportunities.","Turning to Slide 5, let me start with Dan River. By now, you have heard a great deal about the accidental discharge of coal ash that resulted from a pipe break under an ash basin in early February. We have taken responsibility and have moved aggressively on a number of fronts. I will talk about Dan River, the immediate actions we have taken and the longer term strategy we are putting in place. At Dan River, we moved quickly to stop the discharge at the site and have been working on remediation of the river. Our company, not our customers, will pay for the pipe break and associated cleanup. These costs were approximately $15 million in the first quarter. Drinking water has remained safe throughout this incident and ongoing water sampling by environmental experts shows that the Dan River has returned to normal water quality conditions. Decisions regarding our remediation work will continue to be informed by federal and state environmental agencies. Our overall goal is to ensure the long-term health of the river and its ecosystems. We also continue to cooperate with ongoing investigations, resulting from the Dan River accident and defend the company in pending litigations.","What happened at Dan River has led to a broader conversation about coal ash management in North Carolina, which calls for some context. Duke Energy has disposed of coal ash in line with prevailing standards and industry norms since the 1920s when the company began generating power from coal. Coal ash management is an industry issue. There are currently a total of 676 ash basins across the nation. Duke manages 69 of these, 33 of which are in North Carolina. Establishing practices to safely and cost effectively close our ash basins has always been a priority for Duke. However, the Dan River incident has accelerated a reevaluation of our ash management strategies as outlined on Slide 6.","We are currently performing an engineering review of each of our ash basins in order to implement both near-term and longer term actions addressing the ongoing management and retirement for each of our coal ash basins. Near-term actions for North Carolina basins were outlined in the plan we submitted in March to the North Carolina Governor and NCDENR. This site specific plan involves basin retirement at four sites: Dan River, Riverbend, Sutton and Asheville. The plant also addresses actions to convert to dry ash handling at our remaining active sites, the two units at Asheville and Cliffside Unit 5.","The North Carolina legislature has said it intends to introduce ash basin legislation in the upcoming short session in North Carolina, which begins May 14. In preparation, the legislature through the Environmental Review Commission has conducted hearings with the expressed purpose of understanding more about the complex topic of ash basin management. At a recent hearing in which we participated, we shared a broad range of cost estimates, which included a range of site specific closure strategies for each basin, including cap in place, beneficial reuse, and movement to aligned landfills. We also discussed strategies for our active coal sites, including dry fly and bottom ash handling.","By year end, we expect to complete our comprehensive longer term strategies for all of our 69 ash basins across all jurisdictions. We have a $5 billion to $6 billion overall environmental CapEx plan over the next 10 years, including estimated costs for pending air, water and waste regulations. Our waste assumptions, including coal ash, represent about 50% of this range. Our plans, including costs, will continue to be updated and refined as options are chosen and engineering plans are completed. These planning and cost estimates could be impacted by final regulations from the EPA, which are expected in December. We will work constructively with all key stakeholders on this important issue, including cost recovery. Our coal facilities have prudently served our customers with affordable and reliable power for decades. Cost recovery is currently determined by the state Utilities Commission. We are striving for prudent, environmentally sound and cost effective solutions. We will keep you updated on our progress in the months ahead.","During the first quarter\u2019s extreme weather, our teams rose to the challenge and quickly restored service to our customers affected by two significant winter storms. As highlighted on Slide 7, a devastating ice storm in February crippled the Southeast, resulting in over 900,000 customer outages in our Carolina\u2019s territories. In March, we confronted the third largest ice storm ever to hit our North Carolina service territory causing over 800,000 customer outages. Our employees and contractors faced treacherous conditions caused by downed trees and power lines, but were diligent and safely restored service. These efforts resulted in about $80 million in storm restoration costs during the quarter.","Our efforts with the February storm were recognized by the Executive Director of South Carolina\u2019s Office of Regulatory Staff. He declared that this storm was the most significant weather event in the state since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and added when adversity strikes, we can count on Duke to serve the public and earn our admiration and respect. Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to our Duke Energy teams for meeting these extraordinary challenges and helping to provide customers with the level of service they have come to expect from us.","The severe winter also demonstrated the value of our post-merger diversified generation fleet, in particular, in the Carolinas. In January, we set an all-time peak demand at Duke Energy Carolinas and a new winter peak demand at Duke Energy Progress. Our Midwest utilities in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky also set new winter peaks during the quarter. This weather coupled with fuel price volatility highlighted our joint dispatch capabilities for our Carolina customers.","As shown on Slide 8, in the first quarter, we generated about $85 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings from our customers, that\u2019s the best quarter since the merger closed in mid-2012. Through the end of March, we had produced $275 million in cumulative savings towards the $687 million of guaranteed savings over the first five years after the merger. We are on track to meet this commitment, having achieved or locked-in about 80% of the total guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings for the renegotiated contracts.","As you may remember, one of the conditions of the Progress merger required us to execute eight transmission expansion projects to mitigate FERC market power concerns. These projects were committed to be placed in service over time by July 1, 2015. To date, six of the eight projects have been placed in service. The remaining two projects are expected to be in service later this month placing us ahead of schedule and under budget for this important merger commitment.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which began commercial operation last June. We estimated that Edwardsport would build up to its long-term level of availability over 15 months. Edwardsport is the large complex project and it has taken time to work out technical issues. Since the in-service date we have been monitoring our success by progressing through GE\u2019s new product introduction protocol, conducting detailed performance testing and optimization procedures, and obtaining valuable operating experience with the new facility. As discussed during our last earnings call, the extreme winter challenged Edwardsport\u2019s performance in the first two months of this year. We took advantage of this downtime by accelerating a scheduled spring maintenance outage into February. Performance significantly improved in March and April.","All major technology systems have been validated and we continue to focus on final performance testing and optimization. We are on track to be within the total revised project estimate of $3.5 billion. The right side of Slide 9 outlines the upcoming regulatory calendar associated with the semi-annual IGCC riders and quarterly fuel adjustment clauses. In early April, the IURC issued its order approving our most recent quarterly fuel adjustment clause. In this order, the commission also approved a request by interveners to create a sub-docket to examine negative generation of the site in the fall of last year. A pre-hearing conference was held on April 23 and we are waiting on a procedural schedule. We will continue to provide updates on these important proceedings.","Next on Slide 10, I will update you on our process to exit the merchant generation business, which we announced in February. As you will recall the businesses we are exiting includes 6,100 megawatts of coal and gas capacity serving the PJM wholesale markets as well as our competitive retail business Duke Energy Retail. Given the price volatility in this market, these Midwest generation assets are not a strategic fit for Duke. We have completed the required transfer of these assets outside of the utility.","The marketing process has begun and we expect first round bids to be submitted this quarter. Our expectation is that final bids, approvals, and the closing process will likely extend into the first quarter of 2015. We expect the redeployment of proceeds to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our planned exit from this business, we have recognized a pretax impairment loss of approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Steve will discuss the accounting implications in a moment.","Next let\u2019s turn to our international business as shown on Slide 11. International includes 4,600 megawatts of generation in Latin America, about half of which is hydro generation in Brazil. This business represents between 10% and 15% of Duke Energy\u2019s earnings mix and has historically been a very good performer. I will start with an update on reservoir levels and rain conditions in Brazil. Reservoir levels were at about 39% at the end of April versus 62% last year at this time. Thermal generation units are being used to preserve reservoir levels and meet customer demand. In anticipation of low reservoir levels and high electric demand, we strategically reduced our targeted 2014 contracted percentage for our hydro generation. This strategy has supported our strong results to-date by providing greater opportunities to sell power into attractive spot markets. We will continue to monitor conditions. We will keep you informed as the year progresses.","Second, as announced earlier this year, we are conducting a strategic review of the international business. We are evaluating growth opportunities including potential tax effective strategies for domestic use of offshore cash. We have an internal timeline to complete this review by late 2014 or early 2015. And we will keep you informed on this process.","Let me also comment briefly on our growth investment opportunities. We are continuing to actively pursue a number of projects that will support our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate, including new generation, infrastructure projects and environmental and regulatory compliance. For the period from 2014 through 2018, we are targeting $16 billion to $20 billion of growth investments as outlined on Slide 12. We are making excellent progress on all fronts and I will mention a few of these initiatives.","First in April, the South Carolina Public Service Commission issued a certificate enabling us to move forward with a new 750 megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at our existing W.S. Lee site in South Carolina. We expect the plant could enter commercial service by late 2017. Second, we had a very strong response to our request for proposals for regulated solar projects in North Carolina, including both PPA and ownership options. We announced in April that we have received proposals amounting to nearly three times our goal of up to 300 megawatts of new solar capacity. Achieving this goal would almost double our available solar capacity In North Carolina. We are very encouraged by this response and expect to select the winning projects and complete negotiations in the fourth quarter. The selected project should be online by the end of 2015.","Third, we continue to negotiate with the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency regarding our potential to purchase their minority ownership interest in certain Duke Energy Progress plants. If we are able to finalize the purchase agreement as well as the terms of a wholesale power contract, potential next steps would include approvals by FERC, the Department of Justice, the NRC for transfer of nuclear licenses and the Carolinas Commission. We are also continuing to move forward with plans for new natural gas generation in Florida. We are evaluating bids for combined cycle base load generation to be in service in 2018. These bids have been submitted through our RFP process including our self-build option for 1,640 megawatts.","The company has a need for additional generating resources in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. We are analyzing whether to meet these needs with new peaking units, plan to operate, purchase power agreements, plant acquisitions or a combination of these resources. We expect to make filings with the Florida Commission in the coming weeks outlining the most cost effective options for our Florida customers.","And finally in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for proposals to build and operate a major interstate gas pipeline in North Carolina. This will help to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the Carolinas, now served by a single major interstate pipeline. Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas would consider a wide range of ownership options in support of the selected proposal. We expect to choose the winning bidder by the end of this year. This slide also includes other investment opportunities that we are pursuing. Taken together, this diverse portfolio of investments supports our commitment to customers and our ability to grow and achieve our financial objective.","Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.","Steve Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Lynn. Today I will focus on three primary areas. First, I will discuss the key drivers to our first quarter results and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. I will also review the first quarter and full year accounting implications related to the exit of our Midwest generation fleet. Second, I will discuss our volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I will close with our progress towards achieving our overall financial objectives.","First quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.17. These results as shown on Slide 13 exceeded 2013\u2019s first quarter results of $1.02 per share. Our quarterly adjusted results were supported by revised customer rates and strong growth in weather normal retail customer demand. The impact of favorable weather was largely offset by increased storm restoration costs.","As Lynn mentioned in her prepared remarks, we have affirmed our 2014 earnings guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60 per share. On a reported basis, the company experienced a quarterly net loss of $0.14 per share compared to $0.89 of per share earnings last year. Reported earnings this quarter were impacted by a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 billion or a loss of $1.23 per share associated with the exit of the Midwest generation business. This impairment was based upon a fair value estimate for these assets and it has been treated as a special item.","Our fair value assumptions will be refined if necessary as we move through the sales process. A reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials. Adjusted earnings at our regulated utilities business increased by $0.11 per share primarily due to revised customer rates and strong weather normalized retail customer load growth. Increased pricing and riders led to higher earnings of $0.12 compared to last year primarily driven by our 2013 rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio.","The impact of this quarter\u2019s unusually cold weather led to higher adjusted earnings per share of $0.08 compared to last year and $0.09 when compared to normal weather conditions. The Carolinas have the second highest number of heating degree days of any first quarter over the last 20 years, while the Midwest achieved its highest level over that same time period. Growth in retail customer demand led to higher earnings per share of $0.06 during the quarter. I will provide more color on our customer load growth trends in a moment.","Our wholesale business added $0.03 per share in the quarter. This growth was supported by increased contractual commitments, colder weather and volume growth compared to last year. These positive drivers were partially offset by around $0.07 per share of higher depreciation expense driven by prior year cost of removal amortization in Florida and additional depreciation in 2014 for new plants and service.","O&M costs were around $0.05 per share higher during the quarter. Quarterly O&M was impacted by the additional storm restoration costs that Lynn highlighted of around $0.07 per share. Excluding these storm costs, O&M was slightly lower as a result of our ongoing cost management efforts and a $0.02 nuclear outage cost levelization benefit in the Carolinas. Interest expense was higher by around $0.03 per share primarily due to lower post in service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates.","Next, I will address international\u2019s results, which were $0.04 per share higher than the prior year quarter. These results were impacted by higher earnings in Latin America of $0.06 mostly in Brazil. Our reduced contracting strategy, that Lynn discussed, resulted in more sales volumes into the spot market at higher prices. These favorable results were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a $0.02 drag compared to last year.","Next, moving to commercial power, adjusted results for this segment were flat during the quarter. However, there were some offsetting drivers. Results from our renewables business were $0.01 per share higher than last year driven by increased wind production and lower development cost. We expect this business to generate around $50 million in net income this year.","Next, let me discuss Midwest generation. Results for the Midwest gas generation units were around $0.01 higher driven by higher realized power prices. These results were substantially offset by lower earnings from the Midwest coal fleet of around $0.01 per share due to outages experienced during the extreme cold weather. As a result of these outages, we were required to purchase high-priced power to meet our hedged commitments. Duke Energy Retail also had unfavorable earnings in the quarter of $0.01. Our retail business hedges its contracted volumes assuming normal weather. When demand surged in January, Duke Energy Retail was forced to buy high-priced power in the market to meet this increased demand.","Finally, let me spend a moment discussing some important accounting changes that will occur with our Midwest generation fleet. Since we have started a process to exit this business, the plants are classified as assets held for sale in our financial statements as of March 31. As a result of this classification, for the remainder of the year, there will be no further depreciation expense recognized on the plants. And since the assets have been reduced to their estimated fair market value, any future maintenance capital expenditures will likely be expensed as incurred. We expect these two changes to largely offset each other. We will continue to recognize any earnings from these plants in the company\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share until a sales transaction is closed.","Slide 14 highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. Quarterly weather normal retail customer load was 2.6% higher than 2013 along with a 1.6% higher trend over the last 12 months. This was the third consecutive quarter we have experienced strong retail load growth. We are very encouraged and are seeing more signs of sustained economic improvement throughout our service territories.","The economic recovery has expanded as credit has loosened, household income has increased, and overall unemployment rates have declined. In fact, over the past year, the unemployment rate in the Carolinas and Indiana has declined by around 2% well in excess of the national average decline of around 0.8%. These trends have resulted in higher consumer confidence, which has led to higher electricity consumption by our customers. Duke\u2019s service territories remain attractive for business expansion. During the quarter, our commercial and industrial customers announced significant capital investments for new facilities with the expansion of existing one. These investments are expected to add over 3,000 jobs across our regulated territories.","Next, let me highlight some of the trends we are seeing in each of our customer classes. First, our residential customers, where we had quarter-over-quarter growth of 2.9% we experienced higher usage per customer of around 2% as it compared to negative usage customer trends at this time last year. Some of the first quarter growth in usage per customer can be explained by the extreme weather across our service territories when customers were forced to stay at home and use more power than normal. However, improved economic data leads us to believe this strength is more sustainable rather than a one-time event. We also continue to experience growth in the average number of customers across our service territories. Since the first quarter of 2013, we have added approximately 70,000 new electric customers, an average increase of around 1%. We haven\u2019t seen this level of new customer percentage growth since 2008.","Next, our commercial class experienced growth of 3.6% in the first quarter, primarily supported by strong activity in the Carolinas and Florida. Employment rates and real income levels have continued to improve leading to growth in retail sales for this segment. Office vacancy rates were also favorable throughout our service territories. In the first quarter of 2014, we also experienced significant growth in demand from datacenters in the Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Higher sales were also seen in the hospitality, healthcare, education and professional business services sectors when compared to last year.","And finally, the industrial sector continues to experience steady improvement. Industrial production remains above expectations due to strong demand for manufactured, durable, and non-durable goods. We are seeing continued strength in the automotive, construction, and metal sub-sectors. Industrial demand in the first quarter was tempered by factory shutdowns and delays in the delivery of raw materials due to the impact of the winter weather. We are optimistic about the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories and encouraged by the growth we have experienced over the last three quarters as well as over a rolling 12-month basis. We will continue to monitor these trends and provide updates throughout the year.","I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 in the longer term as outlined on Slide 15. I am very pleased with our financial performance through the first quarter of 2014. Based upon our results to-date and assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, we are evaluating opportunities to accelerate some O&M expenses from future periods into 2014. We will update you on our plans later in the year.","The balance sheet remains strong. We recently conducted annual meetings with the rating agencies. These discussions were constructive and our ratings outlook is stable at all three agencies. Our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to invest in our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances through 2016. We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. We expect to achieve our long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% in 2014 allowing greater flexibility and future dividend growth.","Finally, we continue to make progress on our dividend growth initiatives \u2013 on our growth initiatives and cost savings projects. We remain well positioned to grow longer term earnings within our targeted range of 4% to 6%. We continue to execute on our overall financial objectives.","Now, I will turn it back over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Thanks Steve. I am proud of how our team responded to the operational challenges of the first quarter, while remaining focused on our mission to provide customers with safe, reliable and cost effective service. We also made great progress on our 2014 and longer-term financial objectives and have taken important steps on our strategic initiatives to build a stronger future. We will continue to execute on our mission to deliver exceptional results to benefit our customers, communities and investors.","Now let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning guys.","Lynn Good","Good morning Dan.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Just following up on maybe Steve\u2019s kind of closing comments about your load growth and what you are seeing, first quarter represented yet another quarter of better than planned load in trailing 12 months is pretty supportive of a higher growth rate than what you talked about. When are you guys going to decide that maybe growth is at a higher level and what bearing will that have on \u2013 how you are prioritizing the growth CapEx you have laid out in the slides today?","Lynn Good","Dan, I will take a stab at it and Steve I am sure will have something to add to it. We are optimistic about what we are seeing with three quarters. I think when we look at a really weather impacted quarter, however, the science to pull weather out isn\u2019t perfect, and so we would love to see another quarter of strength before we formally revise estimates. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it, but we feel like we have seen some strength here that gives us some optimism about the future. In terms of prioritization of investments, we continue to focus on deploying about 85% to 90% of our capital into our regulated businesses. We are also continuing to focus on building our commercial renewables business. And so you I would think about those initiatives progressing and the timing will really be dictated in many ways by regulatory approvals and as these opportunities develop. So that\u2019s where I would leave it on the prioritization.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And then I guess on your commercial ops with the impairment this quarter, can you just give us an update A, on where that process sits, where you expect \u2013 when do you expect something to be announced or formalized. And then with your AEP and FirstEnergy both talking about the idea of long-term contracting or some sort of re-regulation in Ohio, is that going to prospectively change your timing for moving forward with the sale?","Lynn Good","Dan, we are continuing to progress with the sale process. We are targeting first round bids here in this quarter, so second quarter and then we would expect the process to continue. And we will update as we go and meet milestones on that process. In parallel, we are of course monitoring what\u2019s going on in Ohio. AEP in particular has put forward an ESP that has a non-bypassable charge intended to provide customers with some stability around what could be market volatility. I think they have introduced the OVAC asset and potentially others. So we will continue to monitor that. I think Ohio has begun to recognize that extreme weather conditions such as the Polar Vortex may be creating reliability concerns for the state. So we will monitor how that conversation progresses.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","So, could that change your decision to sell if it looks like there was an alternative to contracts in Ohio or to some sort of other structure?","Lynn Good","Dan, we are not thinking about it that way at this point. We are moving through the sale process. We think that makes the \u2013 fits with our strategic objectives to reduce that volatility in those assets, but we will update you as that process progresses and as we have more to say about how it\u2019s progressing.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Thank you. Good morning.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","So perhaps the follow-up, a little bit on the last question. Shifting over to Indiana, could you perhaps give us a little bit of an update as far as you see recovery of both O&M and purchase power, and how do you the latest sub-docket working out as far as Edwardsport goes?","Lynn Good","So, actually in the slide deck, Julien, there are a couple of Slides, 9 and 25 that lay out the sub-dockets that are pending in Indiana. So, a sub-docket has been opened on fuel recovery really focused on the latter part of 2013 and the issue raised by interveners on negative generation. We do not yet have a procedural schedule on that and we will need to just progress that and update as it occurs. Our focus in Indiana is really on continuing to ramp up and complete our performance testing, optimizing the asset and moving through this important transition. I am pleased that generation has improved in March and April, and the team is very focused on continuing to deliver strong results out of the asset. So I think we will have to move through the regulatory process in the weeks and months to come, and as we have items to update, we will certainly do that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Perhaps to clarify rather, is it that both purchase power and O&M is at risk, or is it one versus the other; just if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit on that?","Lynn Good","Julien, there are two types of riders, right. So it\u2019s a fuel is the one I just spoke about where the commission has opened a sub-docket on fuel and focusing specifically on this negative generation in the fourth quarter. That proceeding is specific to fuel. There are also ongoing filings in the IGCC riders, which addresses return and address O&M recovery. And so I believe the commission has approved through IGC 11, we have 12 that we are waiting for approval on and we are filing 13. And so those would be the dockets in which interveners could challenge costs and O&M and so on. And I think that\u2019s something we will have to monitor over time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","","Great. And then following up on the results in the quarter here in Brazil, especially given the hedging, how is this meeting your plan that you articulated earlier this year, how are you feeling about that. And ultimately, how do you think about the energy rationing as it stands today and the prospects for that and how would that impact you or what have you?","Lynn Good","So the Brazilian operation is off to a strong start for the first quarter, Julien. And we actually benefited from the hedging strategy because we had the opportunity to sell generation into a high priced spot market. As we continue to look at the balance of the year, we are watching this very closely. We like the fact that we have a little bit more flexibility in our contracting position which gives us some protection if the regulator or government were to move into a rationing or voluntary rationing situation, but we do not have any further information on that at this point. I think given the political environment in Brazil, the World Cup, the elections, I think that\u2019s going to be reviewed very closely by the government and by the regulator. So we are watching it everyday. We are watching rainfall. We are looking at dispatch. We are looking at spot prices. And of course, also looking ahead to 2015 and how that could impact our contracting strategy for 2015.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And the last detail, have you delineated O&M versus capital costs for coal ash in Carolina and elsewhere?","Lynn Good","We have not \u2013 what we have put forward are ranges of costs around closure, around investment to dry handling and the installation of certain of these capital costs will drive O&M, but we have not provided specific ranges on the O&M at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thanks Julien.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Yes. Hi good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","So just a few questions on the coal ash issues, the independent engineering report that you are doing, that\u2019s going to be done by the end of May, are you going to have to make that public right then to us or how is that going to get released?","Lynn Good","Steve we are moving through the third party engineering in a sequential way kind of working through all of the basins and to the extent, there are items identified that we should address from a maintenance standpoint. We are addressing those. And what we have committed to do is provide periodic updates on our short-term and longer term actions when we reach specific milestones. We are also updating the regulators on these milestones. So, I haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t made a specific commitment on what we will do around May 31, but you can expect us to make updates on the progress on our short-term plans as the year progresses.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then just on the legislative session, you said there is a short session, just what are the proposals that you are expecting to hear and how long is this session?","Lynn Good","It should wrap up in early July, Steve, so May 15 to early July.","Steve Young","That\u2019s correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay.","Lynn Good","And I think proposals will develop as the session gets started. I have referenced in my comments that there has been a lot of work by the legislative body on education trying to understand the complex topic. So, I think as the session starts, we will have more information on specifics. I think you are aware we have put forward a plan that lays out specific actions around certain plants. We have also laid out a plan to accelerate investment in dry fly ash handling also moving forward with dewatering certain of the retired ponds. So we are moving forward on those actions and would expect those to be considered, although we can\u2019t speak fully to how the legislature will address the issue broadly, but certainly that plan would be considered I think as part of the go-forward strategy.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. Just last question, where do you stand overall on your coal piles maybe you can just give some color there? And are you having to take any actions to kind of preserve coal into the summer?","Lynn Good","Steve, we are in good shape. It has been a challenging delivery time during the first quarter, but we feel comfortable with where our inventory is across the system.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Jonathan.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions. First on Edwardsport, Lynn, it\u2019s good to hear that it\u2019s running about March and April, but can you be a bit more specific what type of range of cap factor have you been able to achieve more recently? Are we just talking about the combined cycle or is this also the gasifier piece of it as well? Just a bit more color on what you mean by running better?","Lynn Good","So, Jonathan, when I talk about running better, I am talking about running on the gasifiers. And so, the month of April was the third best month since the plant has been in service. I don\u2019t have a specific capacity factor in front of me, but kind of trending up March was a strong month and then April stronger. So, we do provide monthly updates to the IURC on our generation statistics. So I think if you follow up with IR, we could probably give you little more specifics on how that generation is occurring.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And you feel confident that it\u2019s going to sort of ramp from here or is there another sort of period where it has to sort of go through more testing and step back a bit or as we\u2026","Lynn Good","Yes, we are finalizing performance testing with General Electric hopefully in the month of May. And we have taken the outage in February to address some of the issues that we experienced from severe weather earlier in the year. So, I think at this point, Jonathan, it\u2019s continuing to improve performance as optimizing procedures. And I think the team if they were on the call would tell you, they have increasing experiences \u2013 increasing experience on the operating profile of the plant is improving over time, there is greater confidence in operations, but it\u2019s a complex project and we are learning everyday, but I feel like we have the right resources devoted to it and we are working hard to continue to improve operations.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Is this something about the technology and very cold weather or that might impair its performance in the future in winter time or was it because you were in startup?","Lynn Good","Jonathan, I do think we learned some things from the weather in Indiana, which was 30 degrees below what we would normally experience. So, my hope and expectation is that we saw the worst of the worst this winter and have been able to address operational challenges as a result of that. But let me turn it over to Keith Trent or Dhiaa who have been very involved in this and see if they have anything to add to that.","Keith Trent","Sure. Jonathan, I would just add one thing and that is there is nothing that was unique about the technology that was impacted specifically by the cold weather. As Lynn said, it was extremely cold, 30 degrees below what we have seen in the past, but it was more exposure of components to extreme cold like transmitters, those sorts of things that are not any kind of unique technology, but we learned from that and we can apply heating methods, which we have done, so that we can remedy that, but there is nothing unique about the technology that\u2019s causing us concerns.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you. Then I if I might I will just \u2013 on another just a big picture, if another quarter confirms what you seem to suspect, which is that your sales have begun to tick higher, how should we think about that as it would impact your overall plan? Does it push out rate case timings? Does it mean we are going to have to step up capital spending in certain areas? Well, how would uptick in sales sort of change what you have laid out for us?","Lynn Good","Jonathan, I feel like an uptick in sales is the best possible thing that can happen, not only to Duke Energy, but to the economies that we serve. When you see improvement in the industrial base, in commercial and new customers being added, I think it\u2019s all around a good outcome. I think it will give us some things to think about in terms of timing of rate cases and capital deployment and we have begun some of that thinking and when we are prepared to share it with you, we will give you some more feedback on it, but generally, I think this is a very good thing.","Steve Young","Yes, I think that we are in the process now Jonathan of updating our forecasts and we go through this process every year for the integrated resource planning process, which is our long-term planning mechanism that we share with the commission and that drives a lot of our generation planning and rate case planning and so forth. So we will be putting through those mechanisms and these changes and see what it yields.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","And what will the timing of resource plan updates be?","Steve Young","We typically \u2013 it varies per jurisdiction. We will typically do it in the spring and the fall in the Carolinas as an example.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much guys.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Chris Turnure - JPMorgan","Good morning, Lynn and Steve.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Chris Turnure - JPMorgan","Could you guys give us a little bit more color on the RFP process in North Carolina for the new pipeline? I am thinking kind of along the lines of total cost and then when we would actually see incremental information as to whether or not you are going to offer in a self-build proposal?","Lynn Good","Chris, we are early in the process. So, we have announced a solicitation with an expectation on the timeline that would put us in a position to announce a winning bid, if you will, by the end of this year. And we are evaluating a range of options, which would also include ownership interest on the part of Duke and Piedmont. And we will update you as we go. We have not disclosed nor do we have a broad range of investment at this point. We are anxious to talk with the various bidders about what they see the potential to be and as we have more information we will share it with you. I think this is a terrific opportunity, not only to underpin infrastructure for electricity, but I think it\u2019s opportunity for economic development in the eastern part of North Carolina. So, we are at work putting together a project that we think could be very strategic for the state.","Chris Turnure - JPMorgan","Okay, great. And then any updated thoughts on M&A given what we have seen in the past couple of weeks here in utility lines?","Lynn Good","Nothing different than what we have said previously. We like the business mix that we have. We like the complement of jurisdictions that we serve. We would consider M&A, but it would need to be an opportunistic type thing. It\u2019s certainly not something that we see as a must-have from a strategic standpoint. So we are monitoring all of it, Chris and would consider opportunities, but nothing beyond that at this point.","Chris Turnure - JPMorgan","Great, thanks.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take Brian Chin with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi, Brian.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Going back to the coal ash issue, would it be reasonable for us to think about the projections you have given on the different options for North Carolina that\u2019s roughly comparable to how we think about the costs of coal ash remediation in other states where you have similar pond issues, is that sort of the right way to think about it or are the coal \u2013 North Carolina coal ash issues so site specific that it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to broadly assume those cost assumptions for other ponds?","Lynn Good","Let me try to jump in on that, Brian. So and I am sure in the back of your mind, you are referencing the testimony that we presented to the Commission or the Environmental Commission in the legislature. As we have put out our $5 billion to $6 billion estimate for the 10-year environmental plan that has included addressing \u2013 ash pond closure results have included addressing conversion to dry bottom ash and fly ash in anticipation of where the steam effluent guidelines will go.","We have as part of our short-term action plan modified that estimate for four sites in the Carolinas by evaluating a closure option that actually moves all the ash to a lined landfill. And so that has added roughly $500 million to our estimates. So it\u2019s moved from 4.5 to 5.5 to 5 to 6. Further refinement of the estimate around waste will be accomplished as we complete our strategic review side by side of all of our ash basins around our system. And so it\u2019s really premature for us to give you more specifics on the estimate or how it will be implicated in other jurisdictions because it will be dependent upon a couple of things. First of all, our strategy and in the case of North Carolina what we expect to be legislation in the state. As we talk about our other jurisdictions, we do not see an immediate push around legislation or change in policies in the same manner as we are seeing in North Carolina.","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood, very helpful. And on that last point about other jurisdictions, is it right now your expectation that resolution in North Carolina will likely lead how other states and your conversations will be resolved on coal ash or is there a possibility that the discussion with those other jurisdictions has been accelerated, given what\u2019s happened with North Carolina and you could see resolution in other states potentially setting a precedent for how North Carolina looks at this?","Lynn Good","At least among our jurisdictions, Brian, North Carolina is in the lead in terms of this discussion. And I think if you think back into the earlier part of the 2000s, North Carolina put forward industry leading set of legislation called Clean Smokestacks where they were instrumental in accelerating investments in environmental around air. And so I think this represents an opportunity for North Carolina to do the same around ash. And as we have moved through this short session, we will have a better sense of how the policy will be developed for the state. And I do think we have an opportunity in North Carolina to lead.","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Very good. And then one last quick one, for the strategic review on the international front, in the past when the strategic review has concluded, basically we haven\u2019t seen a major confirmation from the company in terms of direction one way or another. With the conclusion of this strategic review, is it the intention of the company to provide a positive conclusion regardless of what the decisions is or is it more likely that it will simply be concluded privately and no more future mention of that will happen until the next strategic review?","Lynn Good","We intend to disclose from the strategic reviews completing what our conclusions are.","Brian Chin - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","We will now take Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Thank you. Good morning, given that you are in the process of selling your plants in the Midwest, should we expect that this process will impact your bidding strategy into the PJM auction?","Lynn Good","Angie I have not spent any time on bidding strategy for the PJM auction.","Steve Young","I do not think that will impact our strategy, the sales process, it will not change any strategic intent there.","Lynn Good","But let\u2019s follow-up on that with the IR team on PJM bidding strategy to the...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Secondly, on the load growth I do see the numbers, but they do seem impressive, however, they tend to be significantly skewed towards the residential and commercial load, the strength and those two groups tends to be most impacted by the weather, right. I mean the fact that there is such a big discrepancy in the industrial load growth versus residential and commercial could suggest that \u2013 as you said yourself that those weather minimization models are a little bit off or it could be that your service territory is specifically different, meaning less industrial, how would you describe that?","Lynn Good","I think there are a couple of things I would point to and Steve can certainly add to this. We did see an increase in usage per customer, Angie. So in addition to strong customer growth, we saw an increase in the usage per customer. It\u2019s hard to know exactly why that\u2019s occurring, but frankly because of the extreme weather we had parts of the Carolinas that were home for days at a time. And we do think we had a little bit of additional usage on a per customer basis as a result of that.","The other thing I would point to is when I look at the residential trend, third quarter was up 1.1%, fourth quarter was up 0.7%, both of which are pretty strong numbers. Similarly, commercial was up 1.6% in the third quarter and 1.2% in the fourth quarter. So the other thing I would point you to is over a rolling 12 months period we are kind of at 1.6%. So I don\u2019t have a perfect answer to \u2013 do we have a little bit of weather in the volumes, I think that there is a possibility we have some weather. That\u2019s why we are continuing to monitor the second quarter, will give us another good indication. It will not be as weather influenced. So when we look at all of the factors together including their performance in third and fourth quarter, we believe we are seeing a trend.","Steve Young","That\u2019s right. We have added 70,000 customers. So that\u2019s a stronger number than we have seen. And some of the data that we look at median household income, that\u2019s looking at middle income growth is stronger than we have seen before in the past. The unemployment rate changes are significant as well. So it feels like the economic recovery is broadening and deepening a bit and getting into the pockets of smaller businesses and middle income residences.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","And my last question, so about your coal plant, so you are showing us this very high potential capital that\u2019s associated with coal ash remediation. And then we are approaching June 1 when the EPA is supposed to issue carbon dioxide emission rules and I am trying to understand given that both of these are actually going to properly resolve in a pretty significant uptick in your electric rates, how do you think can all of this CapEx and additional costs be recovered without actually a rate shock?","Lynn Good","Angie, I think the thing to keep in mind on ash is that that expenditure is going to occur over a very long period of time. So even on the short-term action plan that we put forward of $500 million, it is going to occur over like two to five years. And over the \u2013 if you look at some of the higher end numbers that we have put forward assuming that all ash gets moved, those numbers are over 20 to 30 years. It will just physically take that long to accomplish. So I think that\u2019s an important consideration for you to think about when you think about ash. And I think on greenhouse gases in general, we are going to have to evaluate how those rules come out, how they come forward, what kind of flexibility is offered in the states. I do think there is a lot of focus on the part of the EPA on reliability and giving the states flexibility. And so I think we will have to evaluate where those rules come out before we can conclude what the implication will be to rates.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","But your current RFP for solar in the Carolinas and potentially putting it into the rate base is not in anyway related to potential carbon regulations in your attempt to offset your carbon footprint?","Lynn Good","Yes. It is in connection with both a customer demand for solar, but also we have a renewable energy portfolio standard in North Carolina, Angie. And this would be a part of the compliance with that standard.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys. Congrats on a good start of the year.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Michael.","Steve Young","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","You\u2019re welcome. A question, one for Steve, one for Lynn. Lynn, can you talk about just the range of options when you think about a strategic review of the Latin American business, what\u2019s off the table?","Lynn Good","Michael, I am not sure that there is anything off the table. What we try to do when we come to a strategic review like this is consider all options that we are looking at. We have got a great business, a great position, profitable businesses that have been a strong contributor to the company over time. We have some headwinds in the form of foreign currency. We don\u2019t see the growth that we would like to see in that business. So, we are really solving for two things. Is there a way we can better position the business for growth? Is there a better way we can position the business to optimize cash flow? And over what timeframe and what are the trade-offs that we need to consider to accomplish that? So, I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything off the table at this point, but we are trying to be open-minded and explore as many options as we can think of.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And Steve, you made some comments about O&M both in the quarter, but also about maybe moving forward some O&M, can you \u2013 and I know you had the storm related O&M during the first quarter of this year. Can you just talk about O&M trajectory how 2014 looks like versus what your original guidance for O&M was in \u201814? And then what does that mean for beyond \u201814?","Steve Young","Certainly, certainly. The O&M trajectory has not changed and we intend to keep non-fuel O&M flat through \u201816 and we see very positive trends thus far in \u201814. When you pull the storm cost out, we actually see O&M down a bit and we are continuing to find through integration projects and moving people to similar processes and platforms and IT systems additional benefits to offset emergent costs. So, we feel very good about our O&M trajectory.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Lynn. Much appreciated.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you everyone. Thank you for your interest and investment in Duke and we look forward to seeing many of you in the weeks and months to come. Thanks again.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bob Drennan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Robert F. Drennan","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our discussion this morning are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 in the presentation package presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the information on our 2011 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from these forward-looking information.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to the presentation materials includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze Duke Energy's performance.","Slide 3 details the topics for today's call. First, Jim will provide an update on our key priorities, and Lynn will review our quarterly financial results. After these prepared remarks, we will take your questions.","The management team of Duke Energy will host an analyst meeting in New York City in late February. During that meeting, we will update you on our strategic goals and our progress in resolving our near-term priorities. At that time, we will provide our 2013 earnings guidance range and related assumptions, including our long-term earnings growth rate and expectations. More details on this meeting will be distributed shortly.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James E. Rogers","Thank you, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. It's our first call to report on a consolidated financial results of the new Duke Energy. As a combined company, we're off to a great start. The third quarter results reflect our efforts. We are pleased with what were already accomplished the positive momentum we've created.","The work of our employees has been outstanding. As the 2 companies come together, we continue to focus on our mission for customers, and that is providing affordable, reliable and increasingly clean electricity on a 24\/7 basis. We are focused and will continue to meet our merger commitments, achieving synergies and savings for both customers and investors.","Today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for the third quarter. This compares to prior year quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share. Once again, we exceeded Wall Street consensus estimates.","In the quarter, we continue to realize the benefits from our fleet modernization program despite less favorable weather and more results in our nonregulated commercial businesses. We are positioned to finish the year within our targeted adjusted diluted earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share.","Before going further, I'd like to say a word about Sandy. We were saddened by the loss of life and enormous damage caused by this storm. We were very fortunate that our service areas were spared the brunt of it. We have quickly deployed contractors and employees to assist other utilities with restoration. In total, we sent over 2,900 workers to help in 8 states from Virginia to Connecticut. I deeply appreciate the commitment and dedication of these workers, most of whom are still working to restore service in New York and New Jersey. It is an example of how our new scale and geographic scope have made our storm response capabilities even stronger.","Since merger closed, we've been focused on 5 key near-term priorities: first, resolving the North Carolina Utilities Commission's investigation into the post-merger change in leadership and achieving successful outcomes in our rate cases in the Carolinas; second, achieving merger savings and efficiencies and successfully integrating the new company into a stronger, more efficient organization; third, completing the work necessary to determine the way forward for the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida; fourth, putting the Edwardsport IGCC plant into service and receiving approval of the associated regulatory settlement in Indiana; and fifth, our ongoing effort to optimize the performance of our nuclear generating fleet.","Over the next 9 to 12 months, we expect to resolve many of these priorities while making substantial progress on the others. For example, successful merger integration and optimizing nuclear performance will be ongoing priorities beyond this period.","A word on the status of the North Carolina Utilities Commission investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and we are maintaining open communications with the commission. We will continue to keep you informed on this ongoing matter.","Next, let me turn to Slide 5. We are nearing completion of our $9 billion fleet modernization program. This will position the company to comply with more stringent environmental rules, and it will increase the efficiency and fuel diversity of our generation sources. This program allows us to ultimately retire up to 6,800 megawatts of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation. In order to recover these important investments, we have rate cases planned in the Carolinas.","The first of these rate cases is the one Progress Energy Carolinas filed in North Carolina last month. This marks its first base rate inquiries request in North Carolina in 25 years. We have requested a net increase in annualized customer rates of $359 million. This is based upon an ROE of 11.25%, a 55.4% equity component of the cap structure and a retail rate base of about $6.9 billion for the estimated date of the hearings. Around 70% of the requested rate increase is due to capital investments. This includes the 600-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Smith Energy Complex, which went into service in June of 2011; it includes the 920-megawatt Lee Energy Complex scheduled for commercial operation by year end. The filing also includes the quip associated with the 625-megawatt Sutton combined cycle gas plant expected to be in service in late 2013. All of these plants were approved by the commission through its certification process.","The commission has established a procedural schedule, and evidentiary hearings will be held beginning on March 18, 2013. We expect revised rates to be in effect by mid-2013.","We are also finalizing our rate case filings for Duke Energy Carolinas. These petitions are expected to be the last in a series of 3 rate cases for Duke Energy Carolinas to recover capital investments made to modernize the generation fleet. This includes the 825-megawatt pulverized coal unit at Cliffside, the 620-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at Dan River and certain upgrades made at the Oconee nuclear station.","After discussions with the North Carolina Public Staff, we have shifted the filing of the cases for Duke Energy Carolinas until the first quarter of 2013. Our North Carolina filing will be made around 1 month before our South Carolina filing. In connection with this shift in timing, we will request approval to defer depreciation, O&M expense and the return on Cliffside and Dan River until new customer rates are in effect. The Public Staff will not oppose this deferral request.","Next, I'll provide an update on our progress with merger integration as outlined on Slide 6. I'm very pleased with how our 2 companies have come together. We are well on our way to achieving the benefits expected from this transaction. Over the last 4 months, we have essentially completed staffing the organization. As you all may recall, about 1,100 employees applied for our Voluntary Severance Program. More than half of this group are expected to leave by year end, with the rest leaving over the next 12 months or so. We remain on track to achieve the guaranteed $650 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings over the first 5 years. We are dispatching the generating fleets in the Carolinas as one combined fleet.","Joint dispatch, along with fuel savings, produce significant and immediate cost efficiencies that directly benefit our customers in the Carolinas. Effective September 1, we implemented a $70 million rate decrement in the Carolinas to begin passing on the expected first year savings to customers. These efficiencies will extend beyond the 5-year regulatory period and will help us mitigate the impact of future customer rate increases.","Now let's turn to Slide 7, which outlines our ongoing evaluation of whether to repair or retire the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida. On October 1, we provided the Florida Public Service Commission with an independent engineering report commissioned by the Duke Energy Board of Directors in March 2012.","This report evaluated 3 things: first, the technical feasibility and risk of the current repair option;  Two, the estimated costs to repair the unit; and finally, the timeline needed to repair the unit. Zapata Inc. is the engineering firm that produced the report. They found that although the current repair plan appears technically feasible, a number of risks and technical issues remain that need to be resolved, including the ultimate scope of any repair. We have formed a technical review team to analyze the issues raised in the independent report. The team will continue to refine and evaluate the risk, scope, cost estimates and schedule if the unit is repaired. Because of the ongoing review of the scope and cost, it is unlikely we will begin any repair before year end. Therefore, as outlined in the settlement agreement, we're subject to a total $100 million customer refund for replacement power cost in 2015 and '16. This liability was recognized in the third quarter with an offsetting increase to goodwill.","We continue to have conversations with NEIL, the nuclear insurance company, regarding the level of insurance coverage for the repairs. NEIL has not yet finalized its coverage decisions. We expect to hold nonbinding mediation discussions with NEIL later in the fourth quarter. If we do not reach a mediated settlement, the next step is binding arbitration.","The company has not made a final decision either to repair or to retire Crystal River 3. However, the regulatory settlement approved by the Florida Commission earlier this year provides a framework for either path forward. We expect the decision could be made either by the end of this year or by summer 2013. We will proceed with repairing the unit only if there is a high degree of confidence that the repair can be completed within our estimated cost and schedule. Any final decision will be made in the best interest of our customers, joint owners and investors.","In Indiana, we are focused on bringing the Edwardsport plant online and receiving approval of the regulatory settlement for cost recovery. This has been a challenging project but an important one, not only for our company, but also for the state of Indiana. Edwardsport will use local Indiana coal in an environmentally responsible manner.","We are currently in the testing and startup phase and are about halfway through General Electric's new product introduction testing process. We have achieved important milestones: first, construction is complete; second, we have operated both the combustion and steam turbines on natural gas; third, in late October, we achieved syngas production from coal on one of the gasifiers and began testing the combustion turbines on syngas. Additional testing will continue over the next several months.","This testing and startup phase is identifying and correcting issues prior to startup. Issues discovered during the equipment testing and commissioning of the project have required an extension of the project timeline. The in-service date is now scheduled for mid-2013. Based on lower-than-projected revenues and additional costs resulting from the delayed in-service date, our updated cost estimate for the plant is $3.154 billion, excluding AFUDC of approximately $400 million. The estimated cost increase results in the recognition of a pretax charge of about $180 million in the third quarter of 2012. This charge has been treated as a special item and excluded from Duke Energy's adjusted diluted earnings per share.","As for the Edwardsport regulatory settlement, a hearing is wrapped up in July. We are optimistic the Indiana Commission will rule on this matter by year end.","Turning to Slide 9, let me update you on our other major new plants under construction. Cliffside Unit 6 is now undergoing an intensive testing and commissioning process. We expect Cliffside to become commercially available by the end of the year with the current approved budget. Our combined cycle natural gas projects in the Carolinas, Dan River, Lee and Sutton are all on budget and on schedule. Both Dan River and Lee are expected to be commercially available before year end.","Before moving on to our commercial businesses, let me briefly discuss our nuclear fleet. Our combined nuclear organization has enormous experience and depth of talent. Today, we operate a nuclear fleet of around 11,000 megawatts with all of our plants in the Carolinas, except one. During the third quarter, our operational performance for the combined nuclear fleet was strong. We performed at an approximate 98% capacity factor, excluding Crystal River 3. This exceptional performance gave our customers the benefit of efficient and reliable nuclear generation during the hot summer months when they need it most. We continue to push for improvement and overall consistency in fleet performance. Safety is always first. We also focus closely on reliability and efficiency metrics such as capacity factors and operating costs per megawatt hour. We are leveraging best practices and making additional investments in our nuclear fleet to optimize safety, reliability and efficiency.","I want to take a moment to provide a few updates on our Commercial Power and International Operations. In late August, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to establish a charge for its cost to providing capacity services in PJM, consistent with the new state compensation mechanism. This filing also included a request for deferral treatment of the differences between our cost base capacity charge and the PJM market prices from August 2012 through May 2015. This filing does not seek to alter the Electric Security Plan under which Duke Energy Ohio is currently operating. A procedural schedule has been established for the capacity filing. It currently includes a hearing date of April 2, 2013. We have filed a motion with the Ohio Commission requesting an expedited schedule. Our current focus is on obtaining approval of this cost base capacity compensation mechanism. Gaining necessary clarity on this capacity filing will inform any long-term strategic decisions related to this asset portfolio.","The renewable portion of our Commercial Power portfolio continues to grow. We project a total renewable capacity of around 2,000 megawatts in service by the end of this year. Earlier this year, we finalized a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo on 2 of our Kansas renewable wind projects, Cimarron II and Ironwood. Both are already in service.","As for our International business, it continues to perform very well. This business has provided reliable earnings over time. You may recall that Brazil represents half of the earnings from our International business. In September, the President of Brazil proposed a program to reduce electricity tariffs by an average of around 20%. This is tied to concessions scheduled to expire in 2015 and 2017. We anticipate this program will be finalized in early 2013. The program, if approved, is not expected to impact our Brazilian assets in the short term because our concession agreements expire in 2029 and 2033. Additionally, our assets are almost fully contracted through 2014 and around 60% committed in 2015 and 2016. We will continue to monitor this development and potential impact on market prices as we pursue additional contracting for our generation fleet.","In summary, we're off to a great start as a combined company. It shows in our financial performance, it shows in the savings we've delivered to our customers from day 1 and it shows in the way our employees have focused on performing their work. I appreciate and am thankful for their laser focus on excellence in all they do.","Now I'll turn it over to Lynn who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance with the third quarter and going forward.","Lynn J. Good","Thank you, Jim. I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward.","As summarized on Slide 11, for the third quarter of 2012, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, slightly lower than the $1.50 for third quarter 2011. However, it's important to remember that our prior year results included $0.12 of favorable weather. Even though weather was favorable this year, it was not at the same level we experienced in 2011.","This quarter is also the first period that reflects Progress Energy's results in our financial statements. Also remember that last year's results have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split that occurred just prior to the merger closing.","On a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.85 per share as compared to $1.06 per share for the prior year quarter. These reported results for the third quarter 2012 include $0.17 of impairment charges related to the estimated cost increases at Edwardsport and merger-related costs of around $0.42. These charges are considered special items and, therefore, have been excluded from our quarterly adjusted EPS. The merger-related costs consists of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plan, concessions agreed to with the Carolinas commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs.","Let me briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments. Adjusted earnings at our regulated business, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, were $0.62 higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the addition of the former Progress Energy regulated utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida. Updated customer pricing, including the implementation of revised customer rates at Duke Energy Carolinas, also contributed to USFE&G's increase in quarterly results by $0.12 per share. These favorable drivers were partially offset by less favorable weather.","Duke Energy International's results for the quarter were $0.02 lower due primarily to unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil. As expected, Commercial Power's results were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to implementation of the new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio. Our nonregulated Midwest gas generating fleet realized the lower PJM capacity revenues as the market-based price fell from $110 per megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 per megawatt day in the current quarter. Due to continued low natural gas prices, this gas-fired fleet continued operating at record generating levels. Actual generation for the quarter was around 35% higher than the prior year quarter.","Other financial drivers for the quarter included dilution of $0.54 for the quarter-over-quarter impact on EPS resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the merger, and $0.05 of additional interest expense on Progress Energy holding company debt. As you will recall, we issued around 258 million shares to former holders of Progress Energy common stock and now have around 700 million shares of Duke Energy outstanding.","An important consideration as you evaluate our year-to-date EPS results is that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will increase from the current year-to-date average of 531 million to 575 million shares for full year 2012.","Slide 12 presents both our quarter-over-quarter weather-normalized customer usage trends as well as what we are experiencing on a rolling 12-month basis for our regulated business. This chart includes trends for the Progress Energy utilities compared to what they experienced last year. Trends for the third quarter show residential and industrial demand down from the prior year quarter. Since volume trends in any single quarter can be difficult to evaluate, we have also included 12-month rolling average volume trends as a point of comparison. Over the 12-month horizon, total weather-normalized load is slightly higher, with growth seen in all major customer classes.","For residential customers, we continue to experience growth in the number of customers in each of our service territories. In fact, the average number of residential customers has increased by around 50,000 or 0.7% over last year's quarter. This growth is around double what we experienced at this time last year. However, average usage for residential customer continues to trend modestly lower as a result of the challenging economy and energy efficiency efforts. Industrial demand reflects recent weakness in primary metals in the Midwest, the chemicals sector and textile customers in the Carolinas. The automotive sector remains strong.","We entered the year expecting overall load growth to be less than 1% over the prior year. Our actual experience to date has generally met expectations, although customer usage patterns continue to be hampered by the economic uncertainty. Despite improvements in national unemployment, home sales and retail sales, U.S. fiscal policy and the European situation leave us cautious about the strength of future growth. We believe our service territories are well positioned and remain attractive for the long term. However, we are planning our business for an environment of very modest load growth until we see greater economic stability.","As Bob highlighted during his opening comments, we will hold our analyst meeting in late February in New York. During that meeting, we will discuss our overall business strategy, our 2013 earnings guidance range, CapEx and financing assumptions. You will also have the opportunity to hear from our executive team on focus areas and their businesses. During this meeting, we will discuss our long-term earnings growth objectives for the new combined company. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share and have determined that 2013, the first full year for the combined company, represents an appropriate base for future growth.","Our long-term earnings growth potential remains strong and will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses; weather-normalized load growth; reaching reasonable regulatory outcomes, particularly in the Carolinas and in Ohio; achieving merger integration benefits and synergies; managing our costs, including emergent work related to our nuclear fleet and the addition of new resources; and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.","We have included on Slide 13 an overview of the primary earnings drivers we expect in each of these areas for 2013. Continued growth in the regulated businesses and our ability to harvest merger synergies will help us mitigate the decline in PJM capacity revenues impacting our nonregulated Midwest generation. Our detailed planning for 2013 and beyond continues, and we look forward to discussing our strategic plan in further detail during our analyst meeting in late February.","I will close with Slide 14 which addresses our main financial objectives. We remain on track to achieve our 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. In addition to growth in our long-term earnings per share, continued growth in the dividend remained central to our investor value proposition. We are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.9% remains attractive compared to the S&P and the current low interest rate environment.","The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics support our ability to grow the business as well as the dividend. We remain committed to maintaining this financial strength, which allows us to finance our growth in a cost-effective manner, directly benefiting our customers.","In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly financial performance and how we hit the ground running as the new Duke Energy. We have a strong growth platform as efficiencies from the merger allow us to pass along savings to our customers and shareholders. From a financial perspective, we remain very well positioned for the future.","Now let me turn the call back over to Jim for closing comments.","James E. Rogers","Thanks, Lynn. Before taking your questions, I want to emphasize again how proud I am of our employees. We're now 4 months past merger close and they haven't missed a beat in delivering on our mission. They have an extraordinary get-it-done mentality. We are facing our challenges as one team. We know what we need to do and we're doing it. We are determined to realize our vision of the new Duke Energy, turning our scale and diversity of assets into sustained performance and greater value.","Needless to say, we appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.","With that, let's open up the phone lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, we're 9 months through the year, and I think if I've done the math correctly, and please forgive me if I haven't, you've had operating earnings of $374 million year-to-date. Can you give us any visibility into where you think you'll be within your $4.20 to $4.35 guidance range for the year, given we've just got a quarter to go?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, it's a good question, and we're leaving the range at $4.20 to $4.35. As we continue to put the companies together, we've got merger integration that we're focusing on, and we just think that's an appropriate place to be at this point. But as we've said, we're very pleased with where we are. We think the quarter was very strong, and the team is working hard on the fourth quarter.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when I look at the drivers you've given us for next year, there's nothing in there that I think looks surprising or new relative to things that you've talked about as structural drivers before. Is it fair to think about 2013 in some ways as a transition year because the merger closed 6 months later than you expected, so merger synergies will come in a little bit later than expected, you don't get the retail rate hikes until later in the year. If I think about the annualized drivers as they roll into '14, if you're successful, it seems like you have a lot more operating leverage in revenue growth potential in '14 relative to sort of just getting started with getting things working in your favor in '13. Is that fair?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, I think 2013 is an important year. And after giving it lots of consideration, we think it's an appropriate base for growth. As you mentioned, we will have some partial year benefits. The rate cases will be a partial year. Synergies will not be at a full run rate. But I think the drivers of some of the capture here should give you a good indication of where we see '13 and then annualization into '14 would be an appropriate consideration, but we'll have more on '13 in February.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do you think that your 2014 numbers will be better than '13, the same, worse?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, we're going to do guidance in February and talk about '13 and the long-term growth rate. That's as far as I can go at this point.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You can't fault me for trying.","Lynn J. Good","I know, I know. I know.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe I'm going to try and carry on with Greg trying to front-run the Analyst Day a little bit. But with all the generation investments kind of getting toward the end of completion, what do you guys see bucketing as being kind of the next major wave of investments the utilities need to make from a system maintenance reliability perspective?","Lynn J. Good","Greg, I'll take a shot. Jim may have some other things to add. We still have some generation to complete, so the Sutton plant is scheduled to go in service in 2013. We also have environmental spending for the coal fleet that will continue. We have nuclear investment that we foresee not only in the existing kind of fleet, but also to address Fukushimas as we go forward. And we're always looking for ways to modernize the T&D system. As you know, we're in the midst of a smart grid rollout in Ohio. That remains a potential opportunity for distribution automation in our other jurisdictions. So those are the things I would point to.","James E. Rogers","That's a great list, Lynn.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then I guess if you're going to look at the kind of the demand growth, I know you guys have been more cautious on recovery than a lot of other companies have been so far. Do you need to see demand growth better than kind of this 1% a year normalized to support that 4 to 6? Or how do you think you're going to be able to kind of hit those targets relative to maybe a rate filing strategy going forward?","Lynn J. Good","Dan, we are planning the business for very modest growth. So we were at less than 1% this year. I think 1% or less is a good planning assumption going forward. And in recognition of that, we are focused on costs that are consistent with that environment. And so I think that, at least for the near-term, is the new normal we're working with.","James E. Rogers","Let me just add to that. I think Lynn said that well, but I would underscore the point that we're going to have to kind of think through what the new cost paradigm needs to be in a world where the demand growth is 1% or less. And I think that's a practical thought. I think our company, compared to others, is probably ahead in the modernization of our generation fleet, and that's really going to drive our earnings over the next year or so. And all the other things that Lynn listed will also be drivers of earnings growth. But I think it has to -- we have to achieve superior growth through O&M control and changing the cost paradigm. I think that's an imperative. And this combination has been a great catalyst to us being able to do that.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, when you sit down and go through these rate cases, do you think you need to go either to the commissions or to the legislatures and evaluate things like a decoupling or some other source of more structural mechanisms or regulatory policy perspective if demand growth is going to kind of stay at the sustained lower level?","James E. Rogers","No, Dan, I agree with that in this way: I believe that if you look in all the states that we operate in, moving toward more of a formula rate approach, very similar to what they have in Alabama, for instance, and a formula rate approach is the right direction to go in over the next decade for a variety of reasons. One is, is to really deal with the modernization of T&D and continued modernization of our fleet to also address the issue of slow growth in demand. But more importantly, I think it gives us credibility with our customers if we have formula rates with respect to investing in their homes and businesses to help them have -- to reduce their usage. So I think that puts us in a stronger position on the other side of the meter. So there's multiple reasons, all good public policy reasons, to move toward a formula rate approach over the next decade.","Operator","And our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let's see. First, could you just give a little more clarification of this agreement that you mentioned and with the staff in North Carolina on delaying the rate case there and getting deferral treatment? How long would that deferral treatment be in place, and when would it start?","Lynn J. Good","So Steve, what we have agreed to do is shift the filing of the case, really in recognition of the work load that the staff has in addressing the Dominion case, the Progress case and the Duke following. And in connection with that shift, we'll be filing to defer O&M depreciation return on Cliffside and Dan River and then put that deferral into rates over a 5-year period. So this -- there's been precedent in the Carolinas for these deferral filings as you're trying to synchronize an in-service for the rate increase. So we have done this in previous cases. We did it for our Buck plant, for example. And so this is just part of trying to synchronize cost -- incurring costs with the rate mechanism.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just when is, like, in-service versus when you'd actually be getting rates, how long a deferral period is that?","Lynn J. Good","We're talking about a month. So in-service by the end of '12, roughly, and then rates would be in effect sometime later in '13.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one of the drivers you mentioned for '13 is growth in the USFE&G wholesale business?","Lynn J. Good","Yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk a little about what growth you're expecting there?","Lynn J. Good","And so -- see, we gave a little visibility to this as we provided guidance for 2012. So it's the addition of customers, extension of contracts in both the Duke service territories -- historic legacy Duke, as well as the legacy Progress territory. So one that I would point to would be the co-ops in South Carolina. So this is a continuation of what we shared with you in 2011.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just -- I know you won't answer this question, but just for some color on -- I think you mentioned that 2013 is an important year, but I think in meetings a few months ago, you also talked about it as being a transition year. And as I think about a 4% to 6% growth rate off of it, if it is still a transition year, you're not -- in theory, you're not -- you're actually growing less than that because you're off a base that was still transitioning. So maybe is 2013 a transition year or an important year?","Lynn J. Good","Greg -- Steve, I want to say Greg because I think this transition year has taken on a life with certain investors and analysts. And I'm not trying to signal anything specific on transition or otherwise. We think 2013 is the first full year of the combined company. We've had 6 months to get things started, but we are not at a ramp rate on the merger synergies. And so we believe that represents a good starting point for the company and provides an appropriate base for us to grow on. And so, Greg -- or Steve, I don't know how to respond to the notion of transition or otherwise, just highlighting the items that I've talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Really 2 questions. Real quickly, just trying to think about O&M pressures. Now I know merger synergies, and you'll disclose merger synergy savings levels at the Analyst Day in February, but when you think about things that could offset that, meaning O&M pressures, could you give a kind of a handful of what O&M pressure points could exist within your various businesses?","James E. Rogers","Let me start and then Lynn can add to that. As we add new plants, that will increase O&M, but that will be offset by the retiring of plants. So there will be a netting out that will go on there. Fukushima costs that Lynn mentioned a moment ago, these incremental costs -- and they could be up to $100 million a year, these costs could be a pressure with respect to O&M. But Michael, the way I think about it is, the one thing that we've really been able to do well -- and we have roughly $6 billion in O&M every year, what we really have been able to do well over the last several years is really use the cost lever to hit the numbers. And I think that we're going to continue to do that going forward even though there'll be pressure on us from the bringing on of new plants, the increased nuclear cost. Lynn, how do you think about that?","Lynn J. Good","I think those are a couple of good examples, Michael. Another one that I know a number of focus on are things like pension costs. In a low interest rate environment, that also can be a bit of a headwind. But I think as Jim indicated, we are looking at the total complexion of our O&M. The synergies gave us a great opportunity to identify areas we can save costs, and we're looking for ways to maintain a very modest trajectory in O&M growth as we go forward to really match what we see as top line growth potential.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Wanted to follow up the Indiana-related, just trying to think about the process going forward. So you've got the settlement that's been sitting in front of the IURC on Edwardsport for a number of months. When do you think the commission there rules on that settlement and, therefore, when do things go into place as part of that settlement? And then when do you file again for kind of final cost recovery on Edwardsport?","Lynn J. Good","So Michael, we're optimistic that the commission will approve the settlement by the end of the year. There's no specific procedural schedule that would indicate that they must, but we're optimistic that they will rule by the end of the year. And then we have trackers, as you know, in Indiana that would be considered along with the settlement. And the trackers would, first of all, put into rates the return on the invested capital and then we would -- we are intending to file a tracker to pick up in-service, which would be the O&M and depreciation. So those will be filings, the in-service filing will occur shortly, and the other trackers are already under consideration by the Commission.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But can you give a little highlight of just if the Commission approves the settlement, that would go into effect beginning of 2013 timeframe. When would the next potential revenue change related to Edwardsport likely occur?","Lynn J. Good","Probably, I would say, a quarter or 2 following in 2013. Michael, the procedural schedule on these trackers are every 6 months typically.","Operator","And next is Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions, the first one on Brazil. You mentioned on Slide 10 that these 20% cuts on electricity rates will be expected to be finalized in early '13. You're protected in the short term by the contract's structure, by the maturity of your contracts in Brazil. What is the maximum potential revenue and earnings impact, however, once these existing contracts are renewed at the new rates?","Lynn J. Good","Hugh, we're not in a position to estimate this at this point. I think a couple of things need to happen. First of all, the program needs to be approved, and that's going -- that's scheduled to occur in 2013. And then we'll have to evaluate how that impacts market prices. And this is not the only item that would impact market prices. There's supply, demand, there are new resources coming on in Brazil. As you know, they have increased growth in demand of electricity. Hydrological conditions could impact prices as well. So we need to step back and evaluate all of these things before we can give you any clarity on impact.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And I imagine that will be part of the Analyst Day there?","Lynn J. Good","We'll certainly update you in February. And I think this will be ongoing as we see how these rules are finalized.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Good. The second question is on Edwardsport. You mentioned that you've produced syngas at one of the gasifiers, you've produced electricity. Did that test show that gasifier and the combined cycle gas turbine's operating at design capacity, or was there any shortfall from design expectations?","James E. Rogers","Let me, if I may, turn to Jeff Lyash to address that.","Jeffrey J. Lyash","Yes, thank you, Jim. As you may know, we've been through the power island and fully tested it on natural gas, both combustion turbines and the steam turbine generator. In the last few weeks, we've put gasifier #1 in service, successfully produced very high quality syngas and used that syngas in the first of the 2 combustion turbines to produce up to about 115 megawatts. And that testing, so far, has gone very well. While we've experienced some equipment infant-mortality-failure-type issues, we've seen nothing that calls into question the robustness or the viability of the design. The test program is going pretty much as expected at this point.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. If you permit me, can you make any comments on your success to date in reducing your fuel costs on the Carolinas to offset the $650 million rate reduction that you've committed to?","Lynn J. Good","Yes. Hugh, we are on track and see success not only in generating joint dispatch savings, but also in fuel flexibility. I think for the first quarter through September, we'll be filing in the next week some specifics on that first quarter impact. You'll have an opportunity to see that when it's filed. We'd expect the joint dispatch savings to ramp up over time, and similarly fuel. We have about 65% of our commitment on fuel under contract at this point and that, as we burn the coal, that will then flow to customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wondered if you could talk a little bit about your sense of the likely sort of regulatory and political climate in North Carolina after the elections that we just saw, just any general sense as a result of the election, thinking about the governor and just some of the changes there?","James E. Rogers","I'd make a couple of observations and one is, is that what you have seen is a significant -- I mean, the Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate. They picked up several seats in the Senate. They now have close to super majority in the House, and this is the first Republican governor in 20 years, and he won by over 10%. So I think that they're putting -- this new administration is going to come in and they have a lot of work to do. They don't have the same deep bench of people to pull from because they've been out of power in Raleigh for 20 years. But my belief is, is that Pat McCrory will do a good job of pulling talent from around the state into Raleigh to really create kind of a world-class administration. And so we're very happy that he's been elected and proud of the fact that he's from Charlotte, and he was our mayor for 14 years. He is the first governor from Charlotte that's ever been elected.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And I just wanted to switch gears very quickly to confirm on Brazil. You don't anticipate any changes to the existing contracts, existing hedges you have as the proposed --","[Audio Gap]","Operator","Our next question is from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Totally different question for you, Jim. I saw a report, it's a publication called POLITICO, that you're being considered as the next Secretary of Energy when Steven Chu leaves. So what can you tell us about that?","James E. Rogers","Well, the only thing I can tell you is, since 1990, people have been trying to promote me out of this job into the government, and they've been unsuccessful. So I have a mission here to complete of integrating these 2 teams. I'm focused on that. I'm flattered that they would consider me for that lower paying job. But I think my wife would weigh in and say, \"Get the money and focus on Duke.\" So I think that's how I'm thinking about it.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, Lynn, just to beat this dead horse a little bit more on when you were talking about the '13 drivers, I think I heard you call out the capacity revenues as something you cited among the drivers as a negative. And then I wrote down that you said that merger synergies would help offset that. So should we be looking at any of these items in particular as more or less important than the others?","Lynn J. Good","Kit, as I look at Slide 13, we try to give you positive and negative impact in the quarter. I would point to rate cases, I'd point to synergies, I'd point to costs as being important items. Certainly, the economy is something that we'll be focused on. So I'm not intending to give relative magnitude on any of them at this point. We'll give you a full discussion in February. But there are a number of important items on this page.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fine. And finally, any update -- do you guys have a sense of when this Jenner & Block report is likely to be out, and any further sense of timing on moving forward with the Commission's concerns in North Carolina over the CEO transition?","James E. Rogers","As you know, this investigation is ongoing. We are cooperating with the North Carolina Commission and Jenner & Block. We're keeping open communications with the parties, and we're working our way through this. And I'm hopeful that we can find a way to work our way through this in a way that is -- creates value for both our customers as well as our investors.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And but no sense of timing on when we might be able to move forward from that, Jim?","James E. Rogers","It's just hard to zero in on the exact timing, but we're working our way through it. And I think everybody's intent is to do their best to get through this and get it behind us one way or another as soon as possible.","Operator","And next is Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim or Lynn, going back to your dividend payout target, 65% to 70%. If I take the '12 guidance and your current dividend, you are at or slightly above that range right now. So is it fair to assume that if earnings are going to grow 4% to 6%, dividend growth should be somewhat south of that?","Lynn J. Good","Ali, we've been growing the dividend at 2% really since 2009 to bring ourselves into the payout ratio. As we look forward, we'll be balancing that dividend policy with capital spending and growth aspirations, and we'll give you more specifics on dividend in February. But we're committed to growing it. It's an important part of our value proposition, and we're focused on growth into the future.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And separately, can you remind us your earnings sensitivity? A 1% change in load growth, roughly, what does that do to the bottom line?","Lynn J. Good","It's $100 million of net income.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","$100 million of net income.","Lynn J. Good","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, Jim, for you, assuming the Edwardsport settlement is approved and you go forward, given the cost escalations, et cetera, in retrospect from a financial perspective, ROE-owned perspective, how would you grade that project and that investment when all is said and done?","James E. Rogers","I think if you look back on the project, I mean, once you -- 2 ways to look at it. If you look at the total cost of the project and you look at a return on invested capital, it clearly is greater than our cost of capital. So it's net positive from that standpoint. The minute this plant is completed and in rate base, they will be earning at whatever our ROE is at the time and in the future, which now would be 10.5%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you wanted the escalation? You think it was all worth it at the end?","James E. Rogers","I do. And I think we will appreciate the value of that plant more as the years go on, and it's a great hedge. I mean, first, it's the most efficient coal plant in the world, and we will appreciate the value of that plant more and more in the future because gas prices are low today, whether you look out over the 40-year life of that plant, can you expect them to be $4 to $5 for 40 years, and to pick up on Ben Franklin who used to say, \"There are only 2 things in life that are certain, death and taxes,\" I would add a third certainty to that, and that is the volatility of the price of natural gas. So I think this becomes a great hedge against natural gas prices in the future.","Lynn J. Good","Ali, I'd like to jump back in on sensitivity on 1%. I misspoke. It's $100 million pretax, $65 million net income.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Jim Rogers for any additional or closing remarks.","James E. Rogers","Thank you, all, again, for participating in our call today. We look forward to seeing those of you-all who will be at the EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix next week. Again, thank you very much for investing in Duke Energy.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Callahan","Thank you, Ally. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's first quarter 2019 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents a Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will provide an update on the quarter including legislative and regulatory activity in the Carolinas. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and the insight about the economic and load growth trends. He will also provide an update on our 2019 financing activities before closing with key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, marking a strong start to the year. We are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20 and our long-term earnings growth target of 46% through 2023. We remain confident in the strength of our business and the ability to grow with investments that deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.","In the first quarter, we advanced our strategy to modernize the grid, generate cleaner energy, and expand natural gas infrastructure. We added more than 400,000 smart meters, and continue to deploy self-optimizing grid technology across our system. We made progress on the construction of the Asheville combined-cycle unit as part of our Western Carolinas modernization project, and we filed for the next wave of solar generation projects in Florida. Our investments in these key areas combined with our attractive growing service areas are foundational to growth in our electric and gas utilities.","We have several noteworthy accomplishments in the quarter, so let me highlight a few of them on slide four. First, we continue to advocate for modern cost recovery mechanisms in our service territories, and we're pleased to see the introduction of related legislation in North Carolina, our largest jurisdiction. We also recently announced 1,250 megawatts of regulated and commercial renewable projects that we will either own or procure on behalf of our customers. Approximately two-thirds of these projects will be built in our service territories. This was a remarkable start to the year as we expand these important resources in our portfolio. As we invest in new renewables, we are recycling capital from existing projects having announced the transaction to sell a minority stake in our current commercial renewables portfolio to John Hancock.","Finally, we received multiple recognition of our employee's efforts to generate clean, reliable energy for our customers. EEI named Duke Energy one of the industry leaders in safety for the fourth year in a row. This is especially meaningful as safety is our highest priority and is foundational to operational excellence. And in April, Forbes recognized Duke Energy as a top employer for the second year in a row, highlighting our efforts to engage, develop, and retain our workforce. I'm proud of the work our employees do every day keeping the customer at the center of everything we do and driving efficiencies across our business.","Turning to slide five, let me update you on recent legislative and regulatory activities in the Carolinas. In early April, Bipartisan legislation was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly that would give the Utilities Commission the authority to consider alternative cost recovery mechanisms. This would include multi-year rate plans, ROE bands and storm costs securitization. We were pleased to see this important legislation passed the Senate last week, moving out of the House for consideration. If enacted into law, North Carolina would join 35 states across the nation that already have alternative cost recovery frameworks in place, a multi-year rate plan would benefit customers with bill predictability and certainty as we make important investments for the future. It will provide the commission another tool to address the changing nature of utility investments, while still retaining the authority to review investments and the prudency of incurred costs just as it does today.","Similarly, storm cost securitization would provide the commission new authorities consider financing structures to mitigate customer bill impacts from major storm activity. This legislation is a step in the right direction for North Carolina, and we will continue to provide updates as the session progresses.","On the regulatory front, Piedmont Natural Gas, filed its first rate case in North Carolina in six years on April 1.. We requested an $83 million increase from the revenue requirement to recover costs for necessary infrastructure investment. We expect new rates to be effective by the end of the year. In South Carolina, we received directives from the commission regarding our pending DEC and DEP electric rate cases. Aspects of the directives were constructive including a 53% equity component of the capital structure and a 20-year flow back period for unprotected excess deferred income taxes. However, we were disappointed with certain critical aspects of the rulings.","Of note, the commission adopted a 9.5% ROE and this allowed recovery of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to implementation of North Carolina's coal ash Management Act. We will look for the written orders to be issued in the coming weeks to better understand the commission's position on these issues. However, it is clear the regulatory and related business environment in South Carolina has changed and this will affect the investment climate for the state in our industry and in others.","Our commitment to safe and reliable operations for our customers is unchanged. However, our appetite for further growth and discretionary investments will be influenced by our ability to earn a fair and reasonable return. At 9.5% the ROE in South Carolina is the second lowest in the southeast and the lowest among regulated utilities. Further, our coal ash management cost are consistent with our obligations under state and federal regulations and have been prudently incurred on behalf of customers in both North and South Carolina. Both states have enjoyed the benefits of a combined generation and transmission system over many decades and the decommissioning of assets including storage of ash should rightly sit under the same sharing mechanism. We intend to make a motion for rehearing by the PSC and are prepared to file an appeal of these and potentially other portions of the case.","Moving to slide six, let me update you on our strategic initiative. Our transition to a cleaner energy future is well underway. Our $1.1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville remains on track for a late 2019 in service date. The project combines various aspects of our cleaner energy strategy, retiring an older coal plant, building new natural gas units, installing renewables and upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also engaged the community increasing energy efficiency and demand response adoption and effectively collaborating on the successful solution to better serve the growing region.","Renewables development is also off to a tremendous start in 2019. In Florida, we announced three new solar projects totaling 195 megawatt as part of our commitment to add 700 megawatts of solar under our multi-year settlement agreement. We expect to begin recovering the cost of these investments under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism once the projects are in service.","In North Carolina, the independent administrator issued results of the first RFP for renewable energy under House Bill 589 with 602 megawatts of utility scale solar projects clearing the auction. In total, Duke Energy was awarded 270 megawatts with most projects coming online at the end of next year. Including those awarded under HB589, our commercial renewables businesses have added multiple projects to their growing backlog.","Combined with the earnings from our existing portfolio, these projects give us confidence in our ability to maintain the earnings contribution of this segment over the five year plan. We have strong visibility to approximately 90% of the earnings target for 2019 and 2020, and approximately 60% of the target through 2023. This success clearly demonstrates our ability to capture a share of the robust market for contracted renewable generation. We expect these markets remain strong as it transitions away from tax incentives over the next few years.","Turning to the grid, we continue to add new technology to make it more resilient, secure and reliable. In Florida, base rate increases under our multi-year rate plan went into effect this January. Annual rate increases over the next three years support approximately $1.1 billion of grid modernization investments of Duke Energy, Florida including smart meter deployment and other system upgrades that will reduce outages, shorten restoration times and support renewable energy growth. We are also building electric vehicle infrastructure in Florida and waiting approval of our proposed EV programs in the Carolinas. Our recently announced North Carolina initiative would be the largest in the southeast and help to fund the adoption of electric school buses and public transportation with approximately 2,500 new charging stations.","Shifting to natural gas infrastructure, I want to share a brief update on the Atlanta Coast pipelines. Oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the Biological Opinion and incidental take statement are underway today. We expect an order in the case within 90 days. We are also pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court for the U.S. Forest Service permit to cross national forests and the Appalachian Trail. We expect the petition to be filed in the summer and are optimistic that the Department of Justice and Solicitor General will join this request.","As discussed on our February earnings call, we expect construction to resume this fall and the first phase of the project and service by late 2020 and the full pipeline and service in 2021. We continue to advance discussions with customers regarding this approach. Our cost estimate remains in the range of $7 billion to $7.8 billion. We remain committed to this important project. ACP will provide much needed infrastructure to eastern North Carolina and drive economic growth across the region.","Turning to slide seven, I want to take a moment to update you on our ash basin closure efforts and the recent announcements in North Carolina. On April 1 we've received an order from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality stating that we must excavate all remaining low priority and low risk based on interstate. Well, we share the same of permanently and safely closing all basins, we disagree with the DEQ's position. We estimate fullest excavation would cost an incremental $4 billion to $5 billion versus the cap in place or hybrid closure methods proposed by our utilities. This would impose significant costs on customers without any measurable benefit to the environment. The agency's position also fails to recognize the internal impact of open basins and excavation activities that would occur over decades. Under full excavation scenario the state would need to take action to extend closure deadlines under state and federal laws based on the amount of ash to be addressed.","We recognize it's within DEQ's authority to set the environmental policy of the state. However, in the interests of pursuing what is best for our customers we submitted a comprehensive appeal to the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. We expect the appeal would take approximately 9 months to 12 months. In parallel we are developing a range of closure options to support compliance with the order, while also maintaining a focus on cost for our customers.","Under our full excavation scenario it's important to note that it would take time to pursue permitting and construction of new basins to receive excavated ash. As a result the most significant financial impact would occur outside the five year plan with about $200 million to $400 million of incremental closure costs incurred in the next five years. We will continue to safely and permanently close the ash basins in the Carolinas. We are currently excavating basins where it makes sense to do so and have already removed more than 20 million tons of ash in North Carolina. We've also advanced the construction of three ash reprocessing units in the state. Our surface remains unchanged. We will protect the environment and do what's best for our customers.","Before turning it over to Steve, our work in the first quarter demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment and create value for our customers and investors. We are executing our strategy to generate increasingly clean energy and make improvements to the energy grid. We're expanding our regulated renewables footprint with significant deployments announced in North Carolina and Florida and we remain on track for smart meters to be fully deployed in all of our jurisdiction by 2021. This technology will complement other grid enhancing investments to provide customers with the information they expect on improving grid resiliency and security. I'm proud of our progress in the first quarter. As we continue transforming our business and creating a smarter energy future. Our goal is to position Duke Energy to be the leading infrastructure investment and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","So with that I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Young","Thanks, Lynn. I'll start with quarterly results on slide 8 including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year. For detailed information on various drivers and the reconciliation of reported to adjusted results please refer to the supporting materials at the company today's press release and presentation.","On a reported and adjusted basis 2019 first quarter earnings per share were $1.24 this compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $0.88 and a $1.28 respectively last year. For the quarter, lower adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to unfavorable weather and shared illusion, partially offset by growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was down $0.10 compared to the prior year. These results were primarily driven by mild winter weather across the southeast in the current quarter and lower retail volumes on a weather normal basis.","In addition, higher depreciation and interest expense impacted results. Partially offsetting these unfavorable drivers were base rate increases in Florida and North Carolina and higher rider revenues. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.10 in the quarter. The increase was primarily due to a true up adjustment related to income tax recognition for our equity method midstream investments. Higher margins at the LDCs also contributed to growth. In our commercial renewable segment, results were down $0.01 for the quarter. The decrease was primarily due to below normal wind resource this year.","Finally, other was up $0.01 for the quarter and share dilution drove a $0.04 decline due to the shares we issued in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. Overall, these results and our strong execution to start the year give us confidence that we will achieve our full-year earnings target and deliver on our commitments.","Turning to slide nine, on a rolling 12 month basis weather retail electric load growth was 0.5%. While results in the quarter were weaker than expected, we believe they were driven by temporary factors and continue to expect load growth of 0.5% for the year. Our residential class continues to drive growth with an overall increase in volumes of 0.6% on a rolling 12 month basis. Strong customer growth continues to support volumes and employment in our service territories remains robust with four of our jurisdictions in the top 15 states for job growth. We're also seeing strength in the commercial class with sales up 1% over the rolling 12 months, ongoing data center expansions and strength in hospitality and leisure segments helped offset ongoing weakness in retail.","Finally, sales in our resident industrial class declined 0.3% on a rolling 12 month basis, an improvement from the 1% decline reported last quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by strength in the manufacturing of metals rubber and plastics, as well as phosphate and chemical processing. We will monitor over the balance of the year, but overall these retail volume trends along with a healthy economy and growth in our jurisdictions support our long term planning assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities.","Turning to slide 10, we were pleased to announce the sale of a minority stake in our commercial renewables business to John Hancock, net proceeds of $415 million will be used to offset long term debt financing needs at the holding company. The minority interest represents approximately 1,200 megawatts of our existing portfolio, and the partnership also allows for co-investment in certain renewables projects in the future.","After adjusting for project level debt the $1.25 billion enterprise value is an attractive valuation for a wind heavy portfolio in which we will retain the tax credits. The transaction is modestly accretive to earnings and consistent with our financial plan. John Hancock's investment provides clear validation of the strength of our existing portfolio, and we look forward to working together to deliver long term value for our customers and investors. Closing should occur in the second-half of the year after customary approvals.","Now turning to our financing activity, in March, good progress, Duke Energy progress completed its first green bond issuance following a similar issue by Duke Energy Carolinas last November. These bonds help fund our utility's ongoing renewables investments and attract a diverse set of investors. Also in March, Duke Energy Corp issued $1 billion in preferred stock, the largest ever utility preferred issuance, and a testament to investor confidence in our business.","These shares provide 50% equity credit with the rating agencies, and fully satisfy the equity content securities target in our 2019 financing plan. As we outlined in February, our 2019 financing plan also includes a $500 million common equity target. And today we have priced or issued approximately half of that amount. Through early April we priced $200 million of equity under a forward contract through our ATM program. We expect to settle this equity forward in the fourth quarter of this year.","I'll close with slide 11, our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields approximately 4.1%, coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low risk investments, we offer a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long term investment opportunity.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi, Michael.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","Hi. With the one-time true up on the gas side, I mean, gas midstream investment side, is that included in your -- or you including that in your ongoing guidance off the $5 number, 46% off that?","Steve Young","Yes. That's in our adjusted number. We often have adjustments in true ups in the tax arena with taxing authorities. We've typically included them in adjusted earnings.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. I mean, that would imply that there is some other positive offset that's ongoing, right, that makes up for that, I guess -- in the future?","Lynn Good","Yes. Michael, the point I would make is this is the first quarter of the year. You know, we started with some weakness in weather and volumes. We expect those to turn around a bit in the second and third quarter, as we look at the strength of the economy. So I would ask you to think about the full complexion of all the businesses we operate over the full-year, and we will have true ups whether it's in tax or in regulatory, these are things that happen over the course of the year and then developing our plan. We always assume that something will develop as the year progresses. So I\u2019d put it in that context.","Steve Young","Yes. So, we've typically not updated within the range till after the third quarter when we get a feel for where things are going in the weather in that particular quarter.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. Okay. What was the exact size of that?","Steve Young","It was about $0.06.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Young","Hey. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So perhaps just to focus first on the coal ash side of the equation obviously you've had some developments of late which -- to which you've already referred to in your prepared remarks. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on understanding the range of outcomes and the timeline for providing an updated capital outlook just based on the appeals process that you described at DEQ. It seems like there are some big decisions that have been made of late and obviously taken up seemingly by the governor, et cetera. Can you describe how some of these big variables could move and what that means for this incremental capital?","Lynn Good","Sure. And let me break it down, Julien, and see if this answers your question or we can continue the conversation. The appeal process for the order will take nine to 12 months. There has been a series of dates established by the hearing officer or the administrative law judge. We expect that those dates could move a little bit as people respond whether or not they will be prepared but I think nine to 12 months is a good planning assumption for the appeal process. I think in terms of capitals we've already begun to do some work on the closure costs and as we look at the next five years we believe the order if it stands as written would add about $200 million to $400 million over the five year period. And the reason it is relatively modest is because it will take time for permitting, for finding the land, for constructing the landfill and all of the other costs de-watering and other things that would occur under any closure method, those are already included in our capital plan. So I -- you should think about the majority of this impact being after the five year period giving us plenty of time to evaluate how that fits into affordability, reliability, customer rates and so on. And we'll just continue to update you as it move through the legal process and as we learn more moving forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent, just quickly back on the ACP project, appreciate your prepared remarks here as well. Just wanted to understand little bit on the timeline of process here, obviously you need to make strategic decisions and sourcing generation -- supplying generation anyway. I'd be curious on the timeline there to -- that you need to come to terms. And then separately just in terms of the -- with respect to the jeopardy argument and the biological order here, how do you think about timeline and potential overlap with respect to permits and rerouting there as well, given the park permitting issues?","Lynn Good","Sure. And you know, Julien, I would point to two things, maybe three things that we're monitoring. So, the Biological Opinion Incidental Take hearing is today. And as you noted there are discussions around impacts to the biological opinion. This is the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee that you'll probably learn more about and as will we as the court renders their opinion and then a number of questions around the incidental take statement which really challenges are coming in front of the court for a second time. So, these are species that we understand well. We would expect an order within 90 days. And if there is work to do as found by the court then we would expect that to occur over a one to two month period. I'm just estimating that within the construct of what we've seen before from the court, but we'll know more when the order comes out and have an opportunity to give you more specifics on that. So, that's the one thing I would be watching for.","The second is the Appalachian Trail that is progressing. A petition seeking the Supreme Court review will be filed this summer. We're optimistic that the government will support. And so we'll see milestones over the course of the summer on that item. And then as you would expect we are continuing discussions with customers which are important part of this project on the status -- on the approach around phase construction Phase 1, Phase 2, Mountains, Buckingham South, revised timeline, revised cost, and those discussions will continue over the course of the year as well. So we'll continue to update you on timeline. We understand we've got some decisions to make depending on how all of these legal challenges play out, we will continue to update you as we learn more and have more transparency on when the construction will begin. We are planning that we'll be able to begin construction later this year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Julian.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. So, on the -- first of all, on the South Carolina orders that you referenced, how much coal ash was disallowed in those orders?","Steve Young","There was an amount mentioned in the order of 470 million for -- in the DEC order, I have not looked at the most recent directive. And again I would emphasize I want to wait till I see the full order, and that $470 million number is a system wide number, so the allocation would then have to occur to that number. Now when I look at the full number, and I'm seeing now that's about 330 million is in the DEP order. Again that's a system wide number.","Lynn Good","So you should be thinking, Steve, kind of in the 20% to 30% range for DEP, and for DEC and 10% for DEP.","Steve Fleishman","All those numbers, okay.","Lynn Good","That's right. That's right.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then, can the commission still change its view or are they just - before they put the written order or the written order is just getting the details around what they've already decided?","Lynn Good","So, we would think about it this way, Steve, I think the order that we're expecting to come out you know kind of mid-month, will be further documentation around the directive. And then we have 10 days to file a request for reconsideration, which we intend to do. And then, the commission has about 20 days to respond to that request for reconsideration. So, I think it would be that 20-day period where potential reconsideration of this -- the terms of the directive could occur. We are anxious to read the order because we have very limited information now on all of the -- elements here and the real depth of the legal reasoning that underpins this. So, that is the work that remains and we should expect to see those as I said a moment ago within - within a few weeks. After that reconsideration period that's when we would evaluate appeal. And so, then you'd move through an appeal process with a longer timeline of course to work through the court system.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And I know this is not directly related, but maybe indirectly does this affect any interest you might have in Santee Cooper?","Lynn Good","You know, Steve, we've been a part of the process -- a competitive process I think we've talked about that before. We believe we had a lot to bring to the table for this state whether it's an outright purchase or management of those assets. We've operated in the state for 100 years. Legislation is moving through the state, which we believe will establish a process in a way forward that would include additional due diligence and other things. But I think it's fair to say that we will closely evaluate further investing in the state in light of these directives, but those decisions are yet to be made, we have had a long history in South Carolina, it's been a constructed jurisdiction. But I think with this directive we need to learn a little bit more.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then one separate topic question just on the North Carolina legislation, could you just -- is there any timeline for house ruling on it as the governor had a view, and just how would it actually then turn from a law and being implemented in the case?","Lynn Good","Steve, there is no specific timeline for the legislature in North Carolina. So you can expect it to move through the House over the coming weeks. It's really hard to forecast how long that will take. We believe the strong bipartisan support and sponsorship has been favorable. Certainly, getting it out of the Senate and moving it to the House we have strong bipartisan sponsorship in the House. We believe the policy is very sound. So this is what we will continue to update as progress is made, but it's difficult to forecast a specific timing for the legislation. In terms of implementation, having the legislation in place allows us to include innovative solutions as we move forward with future rate cases, but the timing and approach for that is yet to be determined. So, more to come and we'll, as I said before keep everyone updated as the session progresses.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Caroline Bone","Good morning. And thank you for\u2026","Lynn Good","Hello.","Caroline Bone","Good morning.","Steve Young","Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline Bone","Hi. Okay, great. I was just hoping, I mean Steve actually just asked a few of my questions but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how these South Carolina PSC directives might impact your longer term outlook. Does it have, does it push you to the lower end of the growth rate if it were a 9.5% ROE we were to be approved. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that.","Lynn Good","Yes. Caroline, I think when we think about the scale that South Carolina represents to do, we believe we're still positioned to grow within the range of 4% to 6% that ROE signal though does indicate to us an important factor in allocating capital as we go forward. And so you know when I talk about growth capital and discretionary capital and other things we will evaluate the placement of our capital based on where it's attractive to invest. And that's a part of our five year cleaning process and we'll have more to say about that both as this appeal progresses and as we share additional refinements to the five year capital plan.","Caroline Bone","All right. Thanks very much. And then\u2026","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Caroline Bone","-- I know you sounded a very confident tone on the ability to achieve your outlook for the commercial renewables business but I was just wondering if you could just help us understand the earnings trajectory this year, how you kind of close the gap between the $13 million earned in Q1 and the $230 million targeted for the full-year?","Lynn Good","Caroline that's a good question. A couple of things I would point to. So if think about our renewables business between operating and wind assets it's about 50% of what we expect and there was a slow start to the year for wind resources. So the $13 million you should not consider to be a normal run rate, but it was reflected or impacted by weather. And then we will bring projects on in the second quarter and later in the year, solar primarily that will impact those numbers. So you've got a shaping issue on commercial renewables that really links to the question that you're asking this morning. Steve, would you add to that?","Steve Young","Yes. So, that's correct, Lynn. And Caroline we're going to bring a couple of projects and they're going to boost the earnings this year, get it up above the $200 million level. And we've got good line aside as Lynn said to 2019 and 2020 earnings and good line of sight overall to 60% of the earnings. The projects will bring in the early part of our five year plan, the solar projects are going to have income recognized in the one-year to two-year period. But just to give you a flavor for it, we've got a lot of longer term wind profile that we're building as well, and a matter to think about is for us to keep the net income level above $200 million through the five-year plan, given that what we've already built in place. We need to close about 250 megawatts to 300 megawatts of solar per year and that's on the one-year to two-year recognition schedule. And I think that's very doable, when you look at the amount of megawatts that we've put together already in 2019 and the CPRE process that will continue throughout. I think we have a good capability in earnings trajectory in commercial renewables.","Caroline Bone","Good. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Caroline.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Lynn Good","Hi, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So, may be just staying on commercial renewables, congratulations on your asset transaction or the sale transaction. Just want to get a little bit more control in terms of firstly how competitive the process was because there is a lot going on in that side? And do why keep the tax assets given you are unable to actually utilize them right now given your tax profile, why do you decide to keep the tax assets as the part of that transaction?","Steve Young","Sure, Praful. A couple of comments here, was a competitive process we did seek bids and then narrowed it down to a short list and work from there and Hancock became the best partner providing the best overall value. So it's quite a competitive process and a lot of interest from financials and international, global and so forth. So we feel good about that process. And then, regarding keeping the tax benefits of these assets, Hancock does not have a tax appetite. And what we found is you look out you the people that are pursuing the underlying PPA cash flows they're not looking for the tax attributes people looking for the tax attributes, they are not looking for the underlying cash flow. So it's a logical matching here. So, we'll maintain those tax benefits as we move forward and we've utilized some of those tax benefits to date. You can only sell what's remaining. So we'll still have those to keep in our portfolio.","Praful Mehta","Understood. And is there any plan to do further sales in the commercial renewable side or do you think at this point you kind of have the transaction done for at least the near term?","Steve Young","Well, Hancock has an option on some development projects that could provide further proceeds that have been defined as part of this arrangement and we'll continue to look as we develop projects in the future whether there is interest with our existing partner or others.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks. And then just finally on the effective tax rate point, Q1 effective tax rate was 9.6%, I'm assuming because of that one time that you talked about, but just wanted to clarify that. And then also longer term do you still see that 12% to 14% as something that stays not just in 2019 but going forward through your forecast, or does that change over time?","Steve Young","You're correct, Praful. The quarterly effective tax rate of 9.6% was driven down by the booking of the tax adjustment, and that won't recur in future quarters. I expect by the end of the year we'll be within the 12% to 14% range. I don't want to try to handicap now with all that's in front of us as to whether it's lower than that or where it would be, I'd stick with that for now.","Praful Mehta","Understood. Thanks so much guys.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Ali.","Steve Young","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Lynn and Steven, I apologize if you may have addressed this. I did come on a little late on the call. The ROEs that were set on the South Carolina both the rate cases of 9.5% are below obviously what you previously had and below what your budget is for this year of earning you know 10% to 10.5% overall in Carolina ROEs. Just wondering how that impacts or what kind of headwind, earnings headwind does that create, and what are some of the offsets against that?","Lynn Good","Ali, the ROE that you referenced of course is disappointing. There were constructive elements to the order the equity pad of 53%, the amortization of excess deferred taxes. And so as we look at 2019 earnings we always plan for a range of outcomes and believe that the results of this case fit within our planning but as we talked about on the call and in some of the subsequent questions we do intend to request rehearing on the coal ash and the ROE item as well as potentially some others and we're also consider an appeal of the case and the ROE we will have an impact on the way we think about additional growth and discretionary investment.","Ali Agha","I see. And linked to that, Lynn, I mean from historical cases of precedent do you find that you know the ROEs that get said in South Carolina that you see much influence when North Carolina rate cases are dissolved and ROEs are set, is that a good correlation between the two?","Lynn Good","My expectation, Ali, for North Carolina is that they will continue the good work that they've done over many years acting in an independent manner, reviewing the evidence in front of them and we would expect the commission in North Carolina to continue to behave in that fashion. So I think it's premature to reach a conclusion on cases yet to be filed in North Carolina on how South Carolina is going to invoice now.","Ali Agha","I see. Thank you.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Yes. Hey, guys thanks for taking my question\u2026","Lynn Good","Hi, Michael.","Steve Young","Hi, Michael","Michael Lapides","Hi, Lynn and Steve. Real quick, and you've touched on this I think a little bit. The attorney general's lawsuit, I know you're probably limited in what you can say given its ongoing litigation. Is that just dealing with the last rate case and how is that rate case dealt with coal ash recovery or is that dealing with the broader policy of what is the level - what is the process for coal ash recovery or is the coal ash recovery something that should be recovered at all. I'm a little confused about just kind of the main tenant of that case and whether, it's just a one-off of the last rate case that got resolved by the commission or is it more kind of a policy focused one longer term?","Lynn Good","It's the former, Michael. It is an appeal of the rate case. And so I would -- have you look at it in that context because it's exactly what it is and we believe the order out of North Carolina was very well written, very strongly supported on the regulatory laws in North Carolina, and we'll be vigorously defending that case as you would expect. The timing on that is you know briefing will occur during 2019. We expect a hearing late this year or early next, and then potentially a decision in a six month or so time frame. You may remember the last appeal from the attorney general in North Carolina was on ROE in our last case and that took about two years.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then a follow-up question a little bit on Florida, legislation just passed it sitting on the governor's desk in terms of storm hardening. How do you think that would impact your capital spend plans in Florida, if the governor signs it. And given your rate agreement now would you still qualify for incremental rate increases tied to that legislation or in the near term next two years to four years or do you have to wait for the right deal to kind of expire or roll off?","Lynn Good","Michael, the way I'd think about it is that's very solid policy and legislation that I think will serve Florida well, particularly as you think about storm hardening and resiliency, our multiyear rate plan runs through 2021. So, I would think about that legislation is being impactful to our business after 2021; it really gives us an opportunity to look at how to extend and continue important energy delivery investment. You may recall we've got $1.1 billion being deployed through now and 2021. This would set the contracts for more capital spending beyond that period.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you. And thanks, Steve.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steve Young","Thank you.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","Well, thank you, Ally, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. And as always, our team is available for follow-on questions, and look forward to seeing you in the near future. Thanks again for joining.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7828":["Duke Energy Corp (NYSE:DUK) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  7, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Bob Drennan - Vice President \u2013 Investor Relations","Lynn Good - Vice Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","Alex Glenn - State President of Florida","Lloyd Yates - Executive Vice President of Regulated Utilities","Analysts","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Stephen Byrd - MSSB","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","Kit Konolige - BGC Capital","Kamal Patel - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy second quarterly earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bob Drennan. Please go ahead, sir.","Bob Drennan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2013 earnings review and business update. Leading our call this morning is Lynn Good, Duke Energy's President and Chief Executive Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the information in our 2012 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information.","A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at www.duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation include supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance.","Today, Lynn will provide an in-depth review of the second quarter results and also perspectives on our expectations for the rest of the year. She will also take your questions following her prepared remarks. This morning, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.87, compared to $1.02 for the same quarter a year ago.","Principal drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter adjusted results were less favorable weather at our utilities compared to last year, reduced contributions from our Midwest coal and gas commercial operations and lower contribution from international operations, primarily due to an extended maintenance outage at a National Methanol investment. These drivers were partly offset on positive revenue contributions from recently approved rate cases in North Carolina and Ohio. Also this morning, we all are reaffirming Duke Energy's previously announced adjusted earnings guidance range for 2013 of $4.20 to $4.45 per share.","Now, I would like to turn the call over the Lynn.","Lynn Good","Thank you, Bob, and good morning. I want to thank all of you for joining our call today. I am pleased to be joining you as the President and CEO of Duke Energy. As many of you know, Jim Rogers who has left one of his predecessor companies for nearly 25 years will remain Chairman through the end of this year.","I am grateful to Jim for his encouragement and support over the years and I am deeply honored by the confidence the board has placed in me. As well, I want to thank you for your support in the past and for the messages that I have received since this announcement. Also, yesterday, I announced Steve Young, Duke Energy's new Chief Financial Officer.","Steve has recently served as the company's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and previously served as the CFO of Duke Power. In his previous roles, Steve has worked closely with the utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He has deep understanding of our company and industry and will maintain a sharp focus on our financial objectives. Steve complements our special, deep and talented leadership team and I look forward to introducing Steve to many of you over the coming months.","Now, let me turn to our discussion of the quarter's results, expectations for the remainder of 2013 and our near-term strategic priorities. July 2nd marks the one year anniversary of closing the Duke Progress merger. Thanks to the diligence and hard work of our employees and leadership teams, we have accomplished a great deal over the past 12 months.","Slide 4 outlines our near-term priorities and our progress towards resolving them. Let me provide a brief update on these priorities. First, we continue to make progress on our regulatory calendar in 2013. I am very pleased with the constructive orders we have received in the Duke Energy Progress in Ohio [Electric]. Additionally, we have reached a balanced settlement with the interveners and the Duke Energy Carolinas and Ohio gas cases and await commission decisions in the third quarter. I will discuss these rate cases in more detail in a moment.","Turning to Edwardsport. In early June, we placed the IGCC plant into service. This is a major milestone for the company and for our Indiana customers. Over the next several months, our focus remains on plant performance, including ongoing performance testing, completing GE's new product introduction testing protocol and resolving remaining bunch list items from disruption.","As with many of these plans, we expect to encounter issues in the early phase of operation. Our approach is to identify causes and revolve issues as they occur. To-date, we have not identified any issue that will impact the long-term performance of the plant.","Next, Crystal River. Last week we announced a comprehensive settlement with parties in Florida including the Office of Public Counsel. This settlement provides long-term clarity for Florida customers, the company and other key stakeholders. As I will discuss in a moment, the settlement addresses the pending Crystal River 3 regulatory proceeding, the proposed Levy nuclear project, the Crystal River 1 & 2 coal units and future generation needs in Florida.","Merger integration also remains a key priority. Significant work continues to integrate financial, work management and human resource systems. We are on track to achieve our targeted non-fuel O&M savings of between 5% to 7% in 2014. We also continue to deliver customer savings through fuel savings, joint-dispatch commitment. Over the last 12 months, we have exceeded our original forecast by achieving cumulative savings of approximately $120 million. We expect to continue this progress into 2014 and beyond.","Finally, let me update you on our nuclear fleet performance improvement effort. Both the Oconee and Catawba sites in the Carolinas is operating at record capacity factors for the first six months of the year. Additionally, our focus on the single unit Robinson nuclear station has resulted in improved performance in several key performance indicators, including capacity factors and the INPO Index, an independent view of our overall performance.","Over the remainder of 2013, we have four planned nuclear refueling outages and are performing the necessary preparation work to ensure their successful application. As we discussed with you in February, we will continue to focus on achieving top world class performance across the entire nuclear fleet. We are pleased with the improvements we are seeing and our focus remains on maintaining a standard of excellence throughout the nuclear fleet.","Slide five reaffirms our principal financial objectives, achieving growth in earnings per share and the dividends, while also maintaining the strength of the balance sheet. These objectives have remained consistent overtime and will continue as a centerpiece of our investment value proposition. We are reaffirming our previously announced earnings guidance range for 2013 of $4.20 to $4.45 per share.","Our results for the year will largely depend on the following. Resolution of our pending rate cases and outcome of Ohio and cost based capacity request, our cost control efforts including merger integration and our third quarter results, historically our most significant quarter of the year. We continue to target a long-term growth rate of 4% to 6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share through 2015.","We remain focused on growing the dividend on an annual basis and continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 55% to 70% based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. Consistent with this objective, in June, our board announced an approximate 2% increase in the quarterly dividend payable in September.","Additionally, we remain focused on the strength of the balance sheet supported by our liquidity and credit metrics. In fact, the credit rating agencies recently acknowledged the significant progress we have made in resolving our near-term priorities. Moody's placed Duke on review for possible upgrade and Standard & Poor's revised its credit outlook on the company from negative to stable. Our financial plans do not call for any new equity issuances through the end of 2015.","Next, I will provide a more detail look at our financial performance for the quarter. As we discussed during our first quarter earnings call, we expected relatively weaker results in the first half of 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of the issuance of incremental shares in connection with the merger, lower PJM capacity prices, progress from company interest expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange rates and results in Brazil. Consistent with these expectations and impacted further by milder weather on the second quarter and an extended outage at National Methanol, our second quarter adjusted results were $0.15 lower than the prior year quarter.","The quarterly drivers are outlined on slide six. Our GAAP reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48 as compared to the prior year's quarter results of $0.99. These reported results for the quarter includes special items such as the Crystal River 3 impairment, the cost to achieve merger savings and others. The special items are outlined in the reconciliation table in today's press release material.","Let me begin now the business segment overview of our second quarter adjusted earnings results. Our regulated U.S. Franchised Electric & Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment earnings for the quarter that was $0.36 per share higher than the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to the addition of the formal progress energy utility operations","These results were partially offset by milder weather. In the second quarter of 2012, we experienced above normal weather and we are seeing below normal weather during this year's quarter. In fact, a significant amount of rainfall during the quarter contributed to below normal cooling degree days in Carolinas.","In North Carolinas, we experienced the second highest level of rainfall from April to June than we had during the last 100 years. This mild summer weather has continued into July. High temperatures in Charlotte reached above 90 degrees only today during the month of July.","Let's now turn to International, which had segment earnings $0.03 per share lower than the prior year quarter. International's results were impacted by lower volumes at our National Methanol investment, primarily due to an extended planned maintenance outage. Although, reservoir in Brazil continue to remain slightly below historical levels, results during the quarter were consistent with our expectation. We continue to monitor development in Brazil.","Turning to our non-regulated commercial power segment, adjusted segment income was $0.05 per share lower than the prior year's quarter, in line with our expectations. These results are attributed to lower PJM capacity revenues and lower generation volumes for our Midwest generation fleet and the prior year recovery of the Lehman Brothers receivable that have been previously written off. In other, we incurred additional interest expense associated with the Progress Energy Holding Company debt and higher debt levels at Duke Energy Holding company.","Turning to slide 7, let me spend a few minutes discussing our progress toward achieving our 2013 earnings guidance range. As I previously highlighted, we remain on track to achieve between $4.20 and $4.45 per share of adjusted earnings for the full year. As demonstrated on this slide, we expect the second half of the year to be relatively stronger than the first half primarily as a result of three items.","First, constructive rate case outcomes, including nuclear outage levelization, which I will discuss further in a moment, second, additional merger synergy. Third, increased contributions from our regulated wholesale operations. The impact of the Duke Energy Carolinas rate case, the Ohio cost base capacity case and the deferral of nuclear outage cost will be most significant in the fourth quarter.","The recent rate case order for Duke Energy Progress and pending settlements for Duke Energy Carolinas in both North and South Carolina, provide for accounting recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle for example, 18 or 24 months rather than when the outage occurred.","This deferral of nuclear outage cost, known as nuclear outage levelization, is expected to add between $0.07 and $0.09 per share to our results for the remainder of the year, up to approximately $0.04 for Duke Energy Progress and $0.05 for Duke Energy Carolinas. Approvals of the Duke Energy Carolinas cases are still pending. The appendix materials in today's presentation contained an overview of how nuclear outage levelization works. For the year, we expect Franchised Electric and Gas to exceed its target while international is expected to fall slightly short for this annual target.","Commercial Power's results will largely depend on the outcome of the cost base capacity filing pending in Ohio, which we expect in the fourth quarter. We will provide additional update to our annual guidance range after we complete the third quarter which is historically our most significant one.","Slide eight contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class in total based on calculations that include weather impact. For the second quarter, our overall weather normal volumes were around 0.4% higher than the prior year period driven primarily by growth in the commercial and industrial sectors.","On the year-to-date basis, weather normal volumes were also around 24% higher excluding the impact of the 2012 leap year. In the industrial class quarterly weather normalized volumes were 1.2% higher. We continue to experience strength in automotive in the Carolinas and Midwest. Lower activity in the primary and fabricated metal sectors in the Midwest reflects a softening of global demand.","On the positive side, the continued housing market recovery has also supported related industrial activity through our service territories. Weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were approximately 0.5% higher than the prior year quarter, continuing the recent trend of modest growth.","Finally, residential volumes were 0.4% lower for the quarter. We continue to experience growth in the average number of residential customers as they have increased by 49,000 or 0.8% since the prior year quarter. However, usage per customer continues to trend slightly lower due to the challenging economy and increased energy efficiency penetration.","In particular, we continue to see weakness in Florida due to the number of low usage customers and higher vacancy rates. Consistent with our outflows during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. We expect fairly stable economic outlook and activity in the back half of the year as household income growth is projected to remain flat. As a result, weather-normalized growth for the full year 2013 is expected to be slightly below our previous assumption of around 0.5% growth.","Next I would like to briefly address the revised settlement agreement we have reached with intermitting parties in Florida as outlined on slide nine. This revised settlement agreement addresses issues related with Crystal River 3 that are pending before the Florida Commission including our acceptance of the mediator's proposal, related to the NEIL insurance coverage. It also addresses the termination of the engineering, procurement and construction agreement, or EPC, and related cost recovery of the Levy nuclear project, recovery of cost related to the potential retirement of the Crystal River 1 & 2 coal units and a regulatory framework for the addition of new generation.","As you know, resolving issues related to Crystal River 3 has been a priority since the closing of the merger. This agreement is an important step and provides the balance between moderating rate impact to our customers, providing clarity on cost recovery and providing a framework for any future capacity needs.","Let me highlight some of the key conditions of the agreement. First, Crystal River. The settlement clarifies cost recovery of cash adjustment to the Crystal River 3 site. Excluding the extended power upgrade investment and the future dry ash storage facility which are separately recoverable. We have agreed a cash recoverability of remaining cost related to the site at $1.466 billion.","Cost under the cap are recoverable in base rates over a 20-year period beginning no later than 2017. Note that our current cost estimates are within the cost cap. We have also agreed to accelerate the cash recovery of around $135 million from retail customers between 2014 and 2015. And in order to mitigate the impact of Crystal River 3 investments to retail customers, we have reduced the carrying investment to be recovered by $295 million","Next let me discuss the Levy nuclear project. In 2008, we announced plans to construct two new Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear units in Levy County. Florida. Our EPC for Levy was based on the ability to obtain the combined construction and operating license or COL from the NRC by January 1, 2014. As a result of delays by the NRC in issuing COL for new nuclear plants, as well as increased uncertainty in cost recovery caused by recent legislative changes in Florida, we are terminating Levy EPC contract.","Despite this decision, we continue to regard the Levy site as a valuable option for future nuclear generation and will continue to pursue the COL. We now expect to receive the COL in late 2014 or early 2015.","We will continue to recover the Levy investments including the contract termination cost through the nuclear cost recovery clause. We can seek recovery of additional cost to obtain the COL in future proceedings upon the (inaudible) date of any new nuclear units.","Next I will discuss Crystal River 1 & 2. Approximately 875 megawatts of unscrubbed coal generation in Florida. These units have been evaluated for retirement due to compliance with the MATS and other environment regulations. In the event, we are required to retire these units early, this settlement permits us to continue recovery at normal annual deprecation expense through the end of 2020 and recover any remaining net book value in 2021. To continue to meet the future energy needs of our customers in Florida, the agreement also gets us the ability to construct, acquire or operate up to 1,150 megawatts of capacity prior to the end of 2017, and place the investment in rates without a general rate case.","We have an outstanding solicitation to address short-term capacity needs. We will evaluate these proposals along with the construction of peaking units, operate, and potential capacity acquisitions. Our capital plan will be updated to address these requirements as decisions are made. We also project the need for additional generating capacity in Florida during 2018.","We expect to issue an RFP for this capacity this year, which will include a self build option. If the self-build option is the most cost effective alternative and it's the commission grants us the determination of need for this generation. We will be able to establish a generation in base rate adjustment for up to 1,800 megawatts of new combined cycle gas-fired generation.","Prudent costs associated with these new generation investments will be recovered in customer rates without a general rate case upon in-service date, based upon the 10.5% ROE. Finally, we will agree to stay out of the general rate case proceeding until the end of 2018, an additional two-year period to our current four-year base rate increase. However, Duke Energy Florida's return on equity falls below 9.5% during this period, we will be allowed to seek base rate relief.","Overall this settlement has minimal adjusted earnings and cash flow impact. In the second quarter, we have recognized the $295 million free cash write off at the Crystal River 3 investment balance as well as the $55 million pretax write off related to the wholesale allocation of [investment]. These write offs are special items and therefore have been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share of the quarter. This settlement is a balanced agreement, providing longer-term clarity to both, our Florida customers and the company. The agreement is still subject to the review of approval by the Florida Commission, which we expect by the end of the year.","Before I move to our pending regulatory calendar, I want to highlight we are continuing negotiations with certain of our joint owners of the Crystal River 3 site, to resolve any remaining issues they have related to the initial outage and our decision to require the unit. As you will recall, these joint owners hold an approximate 8% interest in the deferred unit. We will provide updates as these negotiations progress.","Next, let me move onto our regulatory calendar on slide 10. 2013 is an important year with a number of regulatory proceedings position the company for the future. We operated constructive regulatory jurisdictions and have five approved or pending settlements with annual revenue increases of around $600 million. First, we have resolved the Duke Energy's Progress case in North Carolina with revised rate that became effective in June. We also have constructive and balanced settlement agreements pending commission approval for Duke Energy Carolina in both, North and South Carolina. These rate increases will likely go into effect next month.","All of these cases are based upon 10.2% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure. They each contain rate mitigation mechanism, which minimize the initial impact of increased rates to our customers. Additionally, we have a final order from the Ohio Commission on our Electric T&D case and awaited decision on our gas T&D request. Finally, we anticipate an order from the Ohio Commission on our cost base capacity request in the fourth quarter of this year.","Clearly, on this filing will help us form our long-term strategic plans for the Midwest generation fleet. Other than a potential filing by Duke Energy Progress in South Carolina later this year, we do not forecast any further additional rate cases in the next two years. This will result in less regulatory risk to the company as well as more rate certainty for our customers. These conservative regulatory outcome position the company for the future, establishing and rate recovery of over $9 billion of modernization investments.","As we look ahead, we will continue to harvest merger synergies, drive additional cost out of our business through continuous improvement efforts, grow our wholesale business and deploy capital in our jurisdictions, including new generation in Florida and the Carolinas. Our commercial businesses will also compliment our growth.","With our focus on resolution on near-term priorities, a constructive regulatory outcome, we have positioned Duke for low-risk, primarily regulated growth through 2015. We will provide details around our 2014 financial guidance and strategic priorities early next year.","Before closing, let me provide some perspective on my transition and current focus. I had the opportunity over the last months to meet with employees and key stakeholders and I am very encouraged by the conversation. Our work matters to the customers and communities that we serve and our employees are passionate and proud of what they do. We have built a lot of momentum over the last year, resolving our near-term priorities and integrating two great companies.","My focus is in three areas. Continuing to deliver on our commitment, strengthening our relationship with all of our stakeholders and positioning the company for long-term success.","Let me briefly discuss each one. You can expect us to continue delivering on our commitments. We will build on our track record of delivering safe reliable service to our customers, operating our assets with affluence and meeting our financial objectives. Achieving our merger synergies and ongoing cost discipline will be an important part of this mission. Effective capital deployment for the benefit of our customers and constructive regulatory outcomes will also play a key role.","We will also focus on strengthening stakeholder relationships. We play an important role in the success of our customers and communities and a strong constructive relationship with our customers, regulators and community leaders is based on trust, respect and transparency. Their success is vital to our success.","Finally, the Duke Energy leadership team will focus on positioning the company for long-term success. The electric industry is changing. Lot of growth, new technologies, new regulations and ongoing cost pressures are just some of the forces that require new thinking and action. As we position the company in the industry for the future, we must innovate every part of the business to address these challenges for the long-term benefit of our customers and our stakeholders.","This includes the innovation and technology deployment, continuous improvements and regulatory mechanism. We must also engage in leading public policy discussions that will impact our customers and our business. The scale and portfolio of businesses we have position us well to successfully navigate the weather ahead.","In closing, I want to thank Jim and the board for building a strong company with talented leaders, dedicated employees and a performance based culture. We have met many important milestones over the course of the year and are focused on finishing the year strong, achieving our objectives and setting the stage for success in 2014 and beyond.","Throughout the remainder of the year, I will update you on our progress and at this point I would like to open the phone lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thanks, good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And congratulations.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","I just want to go over the general guidance you have given for the balance of the year. Maybe review it. You said, you are still on track to meet your overall guidance expectation with the regulated utilities being better than forecast, international being slightly below and generation being uncertain, depending on the outcome of Ohio. Is that a fair recap?","Lynn Good","No. I think the success of commercial, Greg, will depend on whether Ohio comes out but we also have the third quarter in front us for commercial and just seasonally, you can expect more earnings from the base operations in the third quarter.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay, but a big piece of the change in the utility, I am looking in the appendix which you referenced during your comments, page 22, is potential second half impact of the change in accounting for nuclear outage levelization. But it looks like one of the outage has already happened. So I presume that if that decision goes in your favor that that impact the retroactive?","Lynn Good","So, Greg, if I could refer you to slide 7, I think you have got a comprehensive list of drivers to the second quarter. Let me just talk for a moment about nuclear outage levelization. For the Duke Energy Carolinas plant that accounting method will be adopted prospectively, so you will see the benefits in the fourth quarter of the outages in the Duke Carolinas fleet.","The Duke Progress adoption of levelization was retroactive to January, so you see a couple of cents in Progress' results in the fourth quarter on levelization and you will see another $0.04 in the back half of the year for the Progress piece of levelization.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Perfect. That's exactly what I needed. Then prospectively if you think about our forecasting that means that there will be much less volatility in underlying O&M such that it actually will be sort of less of all things equal, less of a benefit in years where you have fewer outages?","Lynn Good","Less of a detriment in the years that we have one.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Correct. Great.","Lynn Good","So I think that stabilization is helpful. So yes, that's right. You got it.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","But it won't change the cash flow, obviously the ongoing cash expense profile of the company in years where you have outages you will be booking those cash expenses?","Lynn Good","That's right. The next rate case. We think that beyond 2015, rates will be set in the future based on levelized outage, so you will see cash impact at that point.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stephen Byrd from MSSB.","Stephen Byrd - MSSB","Good morning and congratulations. I just wanted to talk broadly, Lynn, you mentioned the third of the strategic priorities positioning the company for long-term success and the International business we have seen volatility in the performance of the business over time and as you think about the long-term vision for the company, how might we think about that volatility in the long-term? Ways to address that? To reduce that to be more in line with the U.S. core utility business?","Lynn Good","Steve, I think that's a good question. There is natural volatility in international around foreign exchange rates and to some extent the National Methanol entity is impacted by oil prices or other commodity influences. That volatility as you know has been in our favor in recent years as the U.S. dollar has weakened, now the U.S. dollar is strengthening. It's going the other direction.","We continue to look at ways to position the International business and address that volatility. I don't have any specific plan that I can share with you at this point, but positioning international to complement the growth of the company is the priority.","Stephen Byrd - MSSB","Understood. And, just on the overall O&M position of the company. You are obviously making great progress in looking at your cost structure. Should we be thinking about sort of continual review of that or, as you look out at the cost structure of the company, do you see further opportunities that are as yet untapped or areas that you would want to focus more on down the road, or is it more likely to be relatively stable from here?","Lynn Good","Steve, I think, so staying on cost structure has become a way of life and we will continue to be such. You think about the merger integration plans that we developed, a lot of that work was in 2010 and early 2011. The business is continuing to change and we continue to look for ways to deploy continuous improvement, looks for ways to optimize labor and contract labor to continue to drive cost savings. I think you are hearing that throughout the industry as we grapple with a [loan] growth environment and we are very keenly focused on improving our cost structure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Shar Pourreza from Citigroup.","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Good morning, everyone.","Lynn Good","Good morning, Shar.","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Just on Ohio, assuming you don't get the Ohio capacity to cost base approach that you are seeking, how soon could we see more defined plan on strategic options with the Ohio, the Midwest assets?","Lynn Good","Shar, we are expecting an order probably late September or October. It could slip into November. We don't have a specific procedural schedule. We will take our time to analyze that order, understand what it says about the plants, understand what it says about the position the Commission is taking and then we will analyze and make a decision as it makes sense to do so. So I would say, I can't say it would be by the end of the year, necessarily, but I would think by the end of the first quarter of next year, we would have finalized our thinking.","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Okay, got it. Very helpful. Then if you, looking at the second half this year, how much would the capacity case impact your 2H outlook, especially if you don't get an order until potentially late or mid fourth quarter?","Lynn Good","I think that will depend on what the order says. So you may recall, when we filed the request, we actually asked for retroactive treatment back to August of 2012. So I think we are going to have to see how the Commission has referenced that and at what point the recovery is going at. So what I would point to is our plans for commercial is roughly $90 million of net income. We have delivered roughly $3 million through the second half. So that gives you a range of what the second half could include from a balanced target.","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Alright, got it. Then just lastly, shifting to Florida, as far as the potential new addition of gas assets in 2017 and 2018, when could we start seeing builds occur, assuming you decide and you win the RFP process for 2017 power?","Lynn Good","Let me ask Alex Glenn, who is the president of Florida, to jump in and give us an update on that.","Alex Gunn","Sure, Shar. On the 2018 combined cycle, our timing on that would be to go out for RFP this year and file an E case next year. So that we would get, if we select the self build option approval from the commission, and then that would be an in-service date before the summer peak of 2018. That's on the larger combined cycle on the 2014 to 2017 time frame timeframe. We are really looking at capacity needs in the '16 to '18 timeframe. So we could be looking at new capacity, whether it's purchase, build or acquiring existing facilities in that '14, '15, '16 timeframe.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Could you give us a sense of gone to ROEs that the utilities, either I guess trailing or in your forecast, for this year?","Lynn Good","That's a good question. See, we have so many pending regulatories pertaining to rate case asset, that's an interesting time. Why don't we take that offline because I think what we want to do is to reflect the benefit of the rate cases over the partial year and probably give you a sense of what '13 could look like. We do file surveillance reports in North and South Carolina but both of those calculations have some unique characteristics to them that I don't think is really indicative of what we are earning. So I will ask Bill and Bob to follow-up with you on that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, great, and just to clarify your comment on rate cases, so after this round of cases is complete, you don't have any intention to file, did you say next year or for the next few years?","Lynn Good","Next few years. The one case we are evaluating is Duke Energy Progress in South Carolina and that would be the only one.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, and I think I have one more. Just where are you on any potential interest in the summer plant?","Lynn Good","We are continuing to look at that, Steve. We have been in negotiations for sometime with Santee Cooper. As we have said before, we believe that regional nuclear, we think that we still believe diversification. We think that's going to be important to the company, long-term but we have not yet reached an agreement and don't have any further update at this point.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hi, good morning. Perhaps just a follow-up on Steve's question, what are the various considerations for timing on a South Carolina case as it goes?","Lynn Good","Lloyd Yates is with me. I will ask Lloyd to step in on timing.","Lloyd Yates","In terms of timing, we are looking at filing. If we file that case, we are looking at filing a case sometime late fourth quarter of this year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Any considerations as far as whether or not you would? Anything need to happen or not happen, shall we say?","Lynn Good","Julien, we analyze rate cases based on the returns that we are earnings based on what we see in terms of cost structure O&M, and also maintenance position and so Duke Energy Progress has the same capital as the North Carolina jurisdiction. So, it's Sutton and me and [complex] and so we are looking very closely at it. Just we have not made a final decision and therefore haven't notified the case and all the things that would go with that.","Lloyd Yates","In terms of numbers, if you think about Duke Energy Progress South Carolina is about 20% being higher utility, Duke Energy North Carolina was 80%, Duke Energy South Carolina would be about 20% of utility, so think about it that way in terms of ours.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Excellent. Then turning back to Ohio, if you will quickly? Some of your peers have talked about driving cost out of that business specifically given the transition to restructured markets. Any comments there? I mean, any kind of revaluation as you think about that business' future?","Lynn Good","Julien, we have been focused on cost in the Midwest fleet really dating back to 2010 and that teams have been very aggressive in driving cost out. I think as you know where capacity prices are in this year in particular, you are not going to solve the economics by driving costs out in 2013, but we do have a very keen focus on running as efficiently as we can.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Very fair, and then perhaps lastly as it relates to Florida, if you could just walk through quickly, the interim capacity needs prior to 2018. Is it more likely to think of that as sort of a temporary need more than a permanent self-builds opportunity? I mean, how do you think about that just given this being more of a transitionary opportunity?","Lynn Good","I will ask Alex to step in, Julien.","Alex Glenn","Yes, Julien. We look at it more of a permanent need. I mean, we are retiring roughly 1,700, 1,800 megawatts of capacity in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. We have got real needs to fill capacity in 2016, 2017, 2018. That doesn't go away over the long-term, so we are looking at the 2016, 2017, 2018 as needs for additional generation whether it would be purchase power or peaking units or possibly upgrading some plants and then maybe possible acquisitions out there, plants that are existing in the market, so that's both, the short and the longer term need.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. So, in total, you are really looking at 3 gigs in aggregate of permanent needs, if you will, roughly?","Alex Glenn","Up to. I would say up to that.","Operator","Moving now to your next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Guys, just first of all, Lynn and Steve, congratulations. Congratulations to both of you, especially Steve with your announcement this week. I want to focus a little bit on cash flow. I would love if you could just talk about things like significant items like pension contribution needs over the next year or so. How the potential change in cash that's outside of the U.S., how the change in that tax law could potentially impact Duke, whether you could bring back more cash from Latin America. as well as bonus depreciation?","Lynn Good","Sure. I will take pension first, Michael. We are forecasting a $350 million contribution in 2013 which is comparable with what we did in 2012, and that will be a combination of the Duke Energy Progress plants as well as the plant. On the international front, we have got about $1.5 billion overseas. We have talked a little bit in the past about two things, one being a structured transaction that we could pursue to bring some cash home. That's still under evaluation.","Then the second option would be flat out just repatriation. We could do it with or without a tax holiday, but you have got basically $1.5 billion offshore. Bonus depreciation, the bonus depreciation in 2013 is about $1.2 billion. We are in an NOL position. So the cash associated with that bonus is really going to be realized out in the 2015, 2016 timeframe.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Meaning, you are not expecting to be a significant cash tax payor in '13 or '14 as well?","Lynn Good","That's correct.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. One other question. When you closed the Progress Energy merger, there was a significant amount, almost $4 billion, of holding company debt at the Progress Energy level, at interest rates that are little bit above current first mortgage bond or senior secured debt. What are your plans for the Progress Energy holding company level debt and does that present a refinancing opportunity for you that can be a positive tailwind for earnings?","Lynn Good","We have done a little bit of that, Michael. I believe we took the quick instrument out earlier this year and continue to work at the economics of refinancing to see if that makes sense but I would not say that's a huge driver.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning, my questions have to do with a couple of the items that are excluded from adjusted earnings. The nuclear development charge of $87 million. I take it that's related to the cancellation of the EPC contract at Levy?","Lynn Good","That's primarily Levy and also Harris. You may recall that we suspended most operating (inaudible) on the Harris plant and took a charge of wholesale allocation to the cost as well, Hugh.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, but the Florida nuke costs, those are recoverable under the nuclear clause in that state. Is that right?","Lynn Good","Let me pause just for a moment. So that's the wholesale allocation of Levy and under the wholesale terms of that contract, Hugh, we do not have an ability to recover them and as a result impair a bit of the cost. You may recall that these were identified back into 2012 settlement in Florida as being amortizable in the same way as COR but in connection with the 2013 settlement that provision of the 2012 settlement was set aside and we made a decision to take the impairment at that point.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, and then, the litigation reserve of $50 million. I believe that's something actually with Crescent. I don't know if you could perhaps give us some background there?","Lynn Good","It is, Hugh. We have a made a settlement offer to certain creditors that are involved in the Crescent bankruptcy litigation, really dating back to the Crescent transaction in 2007. The terms of the offer are confidential. The litigation is ongoing. At this point, I can't comment any further on that litigation. We of course, continue to believe that the claims are without merit but we are working through this litigation.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","Great, and then finally if I could, could you just brief us on the post commissioning outages at Edwardsport and what, if anything, they pertain for the plant's capacity factor over the next year or year and half?","Lynn Good","We have made good progress on Edwardsport, Hugh. The focus over the post and service period over the first few months is really consistent with early operations of a new power plant. We have been focused on system testing. We have been focused on tuning. So all of the major technology systems, the power block, the gasifier have been tested. The plant is running on both gasifiers as we speak.","As we have identified issues, we have dispatched the team to do a root cause analysis and have resolved them. At this point, we do not see anything that has developed over a long-term nature. You can expect us to continue to address issues as they arise over the next several months as we really get plant to the point of full capacity and potential.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Capital.","Kit Konolige - BGC Capital","Thanks. I will add my congratulations to Lynn and Steve. A couple of questions, Lynn, I believe you spoke about sales growth being slightly disappointing compared with your expectations?","Lynn Good","You know what I would say is we are 0.4% against an aspiration of 0.5%. We have seen good growth in industrial in certain segments, but weakness in others like I pointed to primary metals, probably the most weakness that concerns us a little bit about the back half is really in Florida, where we have continued to see static low usage customers and not really the rebound that we had hoped as we were forecasting the 0.5% and that's probably the area I would point to that gives us lack of complete confidence on a 0.5% growth rate. So, we will continue to update this in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but we just remain cautious about the outlook.","Kit Konolige - BGC Capital","Is there anything that you see developing on the sales growth that would have implications for your 4% to 6% EPS growth over the next couple of years?","Lynn Good","No. I think we have been very conservative with our growth assumptions, so, we are looking at kind of a 1% type range and we are adding customers at roughly that percentage right now, so I don't see a significant risk to the growth rate given the way we forecasted this volume.","Kit Konolige - BGC Capital","And one other area, if I could you mentioned in positioning for long-term success one of your goals is to advocate for new regulatory mechanisms. Anything in particular you have in mind there?","Lynn Good","I guess I would point back to something that we successfully partnered with other utilities in Indiana. The Senate Bill 560 that gives us an opportunity to modernize the grid. For example, under a multiyear plan to bring those costs into rates in a way that is more smoother for customers and more consistent with the deployment of capital. That would be anything if we could achieve things like that in our jurisdictions.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Kamal Patel from Wells Fargo.","Kamal Patel - Wells Fargo","Good morning. I had two quick questions roughly. With regard to Indiana, and the Edwardsport startup issues, is there any cost sharing requirement with repairs or will you be passing those costs to them? How does that work?","Lynn Good","We are operating under cap in Indiana and the costs that we have incurred are under the cap, so we do not have positive risk in Indiana at this point.","Kamal Patel - Wells Fargo","Okay. Then is probably better answered offline, but the Florida settlement, I just wanted to get an idea of the various remaining balances that there might be for recovery related to Crystal River 3 and Levy, or is everything basically getting flushed out as part of the settlement?","Lynn Good","After recognition of $295 million impairment, the remaining investment in Crystal River should be recoverable under the various provisions, so it would be about roughly $1.2 billion at the end of June on the Crystal River plant. Approximately $300 million on the upgrade environment. Then the Levy investment is probably around $250 million.","Alex Glenn","This is Alex. Right now it's around $200 million. That has not been collected.","Lynn Good","That again would fall under cost recovery","Alex Glenn","Provisions of the settlement in the statute.","Kamal Patel - Wells Fargo","Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our final question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. (Inaudible).","Lynn Good","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Okay. Well, thank you all for participating, for your questions. We are looking forward to visiting with many of you in the fall conference season. And, as always, the IR team is available if there are follow-up questions, so thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. We thank you for participation."],"8124":["Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE:DUK) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  2, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Lynn J.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's second quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials.","Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will discuss progress we've made executing on our 2018 commitments. She will also provide an update on our North Carolina regulatory activity and our strategic investments. Steve will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also give an update on tax reform and our financing plan before closing with key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me began on slide 4 and summarize what has been a very productive first half of the year. We are delivering on our 2018 commitments in key areas across the business. As of June, we have resolved both rate cases in our home state of North Carolina. The DEC order was issued on June 22, following the first quarter order received in the Duke Energy progress case. North Carolina is a constructive jurisdiction, demonstrating a commitment to affordable and reliable power for our customers and financial strength for our utilities.","During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on the resolution of Federal tax reform in our jurisdictions. The clarity we have received is consistent with the plans we described to you in February. We now have direction from our regulators in Florida, the Carolinas and Kentucky. In addition, we are awaiting approval of a settlement filed in Indiana and a proposal submitted in Ohio. Based on these results, we have updated our credit metric forecasts. We now expect our FFO-to-debt metrics to be in our target range of 15% to 16% in 2019, a year earlier than previously estimated.","We are pleased to see that as of yesterday, Moody's has removed the negative outlook and affirmed our current ratings at the holding company, recognizing the benefits of Duke's scale, our constructive regulatory jurisdictions and our response to tax reform. As we execute on our long-term strategy, we are on track to achieve our financial objectives.","With strong results for the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 and our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022. We expect to be at the low-end of the range in 2019 and at the mid to high-end of the range in 2020 and beyond. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 4.2%. This is in line with our objective to grow dividends consistent with our long-term earnings growth range.","Turning to slide 5, I'll provide the detail on the order received in June for our Duke Energy Carolinas rate case. Resolution of both the DEC and DEP rate cases in 2018 provides clarity, as we continue investing to benefit our customers. The commission approved new rates for our $13.5 billion DEC rate base with rates effective yesterday. Similar to the DEP decision received in February, the order approved a 9.9% ROE on a 52% equity component of the capital structure. We also received approval to recover deferred coal ash costs over a five-year period, with the full debt and equity return.","Ongoing coal ash costs will be deferred with a return and be considered in the next rate case. Specific to DEC, the order approved the cancellation of the Lee Nuclear project as originally envisioned and recovery of development costs over a 12-year period without a return. We will maintain the combined operating license as an option for possible future development. The order also addressed Federal tax reform.","Rates will be reduced for the lower income tax rate and the commission will consider the treatment of excess deferred income taxes in three years or in the next rate case, whichever is sooner. This is a constructive outcome that balances providing immediate benefits to customers with supporting credit quality at the utility.","Finally, the order addressed grid investment. The commission noted that maintaining adequate and reliable electric service includes staying abreast of the latest developments in technology and equipment. The order deemed it reasonable and prudent to deploy smart meters on a full scale basis. It also approved deferral of costs associated with our new customer information system, the digital platform that will allow us to tailor new solutions for customers. And though we were disappointed, the order denied a request for a Grid Reliability and Resiliency Rider, arguing the commission lacked statutory authority in this instance, the commission encourages ongoing grid investment and our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders.","Moving forward, we will continue advancing the dialogue with key stakeholders to enhance North Carolina's regulatory framework for recovery of grid investments. This infrastructure will provide significant benefits to our customers, including improved customer control and convenience, and cyber and physical security enhancements while creating thousands of jobs and supporting the state's economy.","In addition, our customers' have expressed clear interest in battery storage and other reliability investments, as well as new technologies that enable distributed generation and energy efficiency. We will build on the momentum from our efforts over the last year including the grid settlement with environmental groups in our DEC rate case and generate even broader support for grid investment that aligns with our customers' interests.","Moving to slide 6, let me provide an update on some of our other strategic investments. Construction continues in our 1,600 megawatt Citrus County combined-cycle plant in Florida. We have begun commissioning activities. And yesterday, we achieved first fire on Power Block 1, a significant milestone for the project. We are on track to place Unit 1 in service this fall with Unit 2 following by the end of the year.","On July 10, the Florida Public Service Commission approved our requested $200 million revenue increase for the plant under the GBRA mechanism. New rates are expected to be implemented the month following the in-service dates. Also in Florida, we filed our first petitions under the solar-based rate adjustment mechanism for two new solar projects. The projects totaling 149 megawatts are expected to come online in December 2018 and March 2020. The requested revenue requirement for the two projects is approximately $30 million.","Our Western Carolinas modernization project is progressing well and remains on track for the expected 2019 in-service date. This project fits squarely within our strategic priorities. We are replacing aging coal units with new natural gas-fired generation and utility scale solar and updating transmission and distribution assets, including adding battery storage. We continue to look for opportunities to apply similar solutions elsewhere in our jurisdictions.","In July, we launched the first request for proposal for new renewable energy resources in North Carolina under House Bill 589. This 680 megawatt solicitation seeks projects capable of being placed in service by the end of 2020. Bids are due September 11. Recall that Duke can participate in the RFPs with proposals from our Utilities and Commercial Renewables business, subject to certain restrictions. In Commercial Renewables, our 25 megawatt Shoreham Solar facility on Long Island, New York, achieved commercial operation in the third quarter, and we have closed the tax equity financing for this project.","Turning to our Gas business on slide 7, we're making significant progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In May, we received FERC approval to start full construction on the West Virginia portion of the pipeline. We made a similar request for North Carolina and received approval in July. Construction also continues in West Virginia and North Carolina on two of the three compressor stations and other facilities required for the project. We expect the final state permit in Virginia in the coming weeks and are targeting a fourth quarter 2019 in-service date for the project.","Last week, we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension of our nationwide permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for water crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to complying with the permit requirements and the suspension will allow the Army Corps time to thoroughly review our crossing plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from this review.","And finally last month, we announced Piedmont Natural Gas will construct a new liquefied natural gas facility in North Carolina. This $250 million investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods. The facility will be located in Robeson County on property Piedmont already owns. We expect to begin construction in the summer of 2019 with an estimated completion date in the summer of 2021. Piedmont will seek recovery of the investment in a future rate case after the project is in service.","As I turn the call over to Steve, our results this quarter show that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We've continued executing on our long-term strategy, investing in infrastructure our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors. As we head into the third quarter, our achievements reaffirm the confidence we have in the business and reinforce our belief that Duke Energy is the leading energy infrastructure company.","Steve, let me turn it to you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. I'll start on slide 8 with quarterly results, including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.","On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 second quarter earnings per share were $0.71 compared to $0.98 last year. Second quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to $1.01 in the prior year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings was primarily due to changes related to the DEC rate case order.","For the quarter, lower adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to a lower tax shield on holding company interest. As a result of the Tax Act, higher depreciation and higher O&M, partially offset by warmer weather and contributions from the DEP North Carolina rate case.","Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure results were down $0.03 compared to the prior year. The primary drivers were higher depreciation due to our growing asset base, higher O&M driven by storm costs, and cost related to the resolution of FERC accounting matters that impacted wholesale. Partially offsetting these drivers were favorable weather, the contribution from the DEP North Carolina rate case and increased rider revenues. The growth in rider revenues was primarily due to the recovery of our grid investments in the Midwest and the recovery of qualifying facility power purchases through the fuel rider in North Carolina as a result of House Bill 589.","Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, as expected results were flat in the quarter. We continue to expect our LDC businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.02 for the quarter, primarily due to a favorable settlement on a contractual agreement.","Finally, Other was down $0.07 due to a lower tax yield on HoldCo interest, as a result of the Tax Act and higher interest expense at the holding company. Based on our results to-date and expectations for the second half of the year, we're tracking to the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share.","Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.3%. Load growth remains particularly strong in our residential class, which was up 1.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. This was largely supported by continued customer growth across our service territories, and in several jurisdictions load grew faster than the number of customers in the quarter, indicating growth in usage per customers like we saw in the first quarter of this year.","In the customer class, sales were flat over the rolling 12 months. We continue to see relatively flat volumes from this sector, as strength in leisure and hospitality businesses offset weakness in large retailers competing with online offerings.","The industrial class saw a decline of 1.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Similar to the first quarter, results continue to being impacted by production declines for a few large customers last year and recent outage activities. We expect the impact from these specific declines to peak this quarter and start to diminish in the second half of the year.","At a macro level, economic indicators for our service areas remain strong. Population growth is solid and we are now seeing wages in non-urban areas increase for the first time in quite a while. We remain confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities, supported by healthy economies and growth in our jurisdictions.","Turning to slide 10, we have made significant progress addressing tax reform across our utilities. As Lynn mentioned, we received clarity in North Carolina with tax reform incorporated into the DEC rate case. We also reached a constructive tax reform settlement in Indiana. It defines a balanced approach that will ensure customers receive benefits with the base rate reduction in September.","The settlement also maintains the utilities credit quality by staggering the return of excess deferred income taxes or EDIT and utilize some of the tax benefits to offset deferred costs. And finally, just last week we filed a request in Ohio to implement a new rider that will flow back all remaining impacts of Federal tax reform to our electric customers in that state, including the return of unprotected EDIT over 10 years.","Our successful work to engage stakeholders over the past six months demonstrates our ability to reach balanced solutions and provides us with increased clarity in our largest jurisdictions as we move into the second half of the year. With constructive rulings on tax reform, along with greater clarity from the DEP and DEC rate cases, we have refreshed our credit metric projections.","As you can see on slide 11, we now expect our FFO-to-debt metric to be within our target range of 15% to 16% in 2019, a year earlier than originally expected. We met with all three rating agencies to go over these updates, and as Lynn mentioned, Moody's responded just yesterday by lifting our negative outlook and affirming our current ratings at the holding company. We are now at a stable outlook with both Moody's and S&P, further highlighting the successful execution of our plan.","As we outlined in February, our financing plan includes a $2 billion equity target for 2018. And to-date, we have priced nearly the entire amount. During the second quarter, we priced $200 million of equity under a forward contract through our ATM program. We also settled half of our March offering in June, drawing down $800 million.","We expect to settle all outstanding equity forwards in the fourth quarter. Recall that beyond 2018, we intent to issue $350 million of equity per year through our DRIP and ATM programs, during the remainder of the five-year plan. Our improved credit metrics and Moody's move to stable are further evidence that our financing plan is sound, and we do not expect to issue additional equity over the five-year plan.","I'll close with slide 12. It is clear we have the right strategy in place, investing to benefit our customers, growing the business and delivering value for investors. The foundation of our attractive investor value proposition is a growing dividend, which currently yields approximately 4.5%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6%, this provides a compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. We believe our combination of scale, diversity in constructive jurisdictions and growth from low-risk regulated investments is unmatched and our consistent execution and demonstrated ability to achieve results position Duke Energy as a core energy infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for reiterating your prior statements on the guidance range which we were wondering where that was in the slide deck.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We appreciate the feedback, Jonathan. You're closely reviewing the slide deck, which is good.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. And then, could I just ask about the industrial sales? Steve, you mentioned that you've been seeing curtailments, but which segment is that in and why are you \u2013 can you just give us some more color into your confidence that there's going to be a rebound second half?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, I think there will be. We've seen a few customers, about three customers that have had some closings or some outages. I don't want to give any customer information that's specific. We've seen that in the Midwest and in the Carolinas. I will give that information. But we think these are singular, and we think the economic health of our service territories are good, they're good places to do business, and we're seeing economic projects landing in our footprint. And I do think that as we move forward, we'll be lapping, if you will, quarters where these outages began. So, I think we'll see some uplift in the industrial load as we move to the last half of the year because of just that fact.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Without naming names there, can you share what industrial sectors we're talking about?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We've seen some textiles. We've seen some paper and we've seen some metals.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, the other question we had was on, you said you were going to come out with the winners in the 589 RFP shortly. Can you remind us sort of what you have in the plan for the utility in terms of renewables, owned renewables, and then maybe what's currently in for Commercial Renewables?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, we put all of the renewables capital in one place in the five-year plan, so it's under Commercial Renewables and it's about $1.5 billion over the five-year period. The 589 RFP will close September 11, so in the third quarter or fourth quarter, we should have more clarity on that and we will be bidding into it as I know others will. We have the opportunity to win up to 30%, but also have an opportunity to buy beyond that if we think the economics work for us.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, we should think of the placeholder in Commercial as potentially being partly in the utility eventually, but it's just all there at the moment?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's right. That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And I think the other point to note on that, Jonathan, is because it's in Commercial, we would expect investment beyond North Carolina in those numbers, right. So, as we continue to pursue commercial development. So everything is in there and as we get more clarity on how the RFP plays out and so on, we'll of course update those numbers. So, there could be some upside potential, but I think the $1.5 billion is a good planning assumption.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. This is actually Claire stepping in for Julien.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi Claire.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Claire.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, my first actually has to do with the South Carolina rate case. So, I know there's been a bit of a political situation down there. Just you're thoughts on timing and your prospects on the case?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. So Claire, we're evaluating the case in South Carolina and as you know from our history, we typically have investments impacting both of our jurisdictions similarly. So, you can think about a South Carolina case perhaps later this year, towards the end of the year that would then be \u2013 go through the process in 2019.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Anything more than a 3Q or 4Q event or just generally second half of year?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I'm sorry, could you repeat that, we had trouble hearing you a little bit?","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, no problem. Any specificity besides end of the year, maybe 3Q or 4Q or are you just saying for now end of the year?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I would target fourth quarter for filing of a case. It won't be sooner than that.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful color. And turning to North Carolina here, do you have any color you can give right now on the grid mod rider strategy for the legislative session for next year and anything we should be watching in the ongoing state elections?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Claire, we have talked about our strategic priority on grid for some time and described that as being a parallel process between the regulatory and the legislative arena. We have a number of options that we're considering. And our objective is to continue to advance the dialogue. We think there are great customer benefits, economic benefits and our role will be to continue to engage with customers and stakeholders to build momentum for what we're trying to achieve.","And so, I think what I would leave you with on this is our strategic priority around this has not changed and the work continues and as we have more clarity about specific tactics that we'll pursue, we'll discuss them with you at that time, but it remains front and center priority for us here in the Carolinas.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi there. Good morning. This is Maheep on behalf of Mike.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the ACP, could you discuss any potential upside opportunity at Piedmont from the pipeline?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The ACP is an important investment into the Carolinas to support the Piedmont system, and we have capital in the plan in connection with that expansion that is part of the ordinary course business of supporting the Piedmont system. So, I don't have anything specific that I would point to, but our hope and expectation is that with that additional mainline pipe into the Carolinas that we will see further expansion opportunities with industrials and new customers in that Eastern part of the state that will continue to drive investment.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry about that, that was on mute. Thanks for the answer. And just on grid mod rider, could you just talk about how these rate case settlements have helped you getting support for an any grid rider legislations?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think about the partial settlement in the DEC case as being an indication of our ability and willingness to sit down with stakeholders, to come up with collaborative approaches. I think it's particularly important as you think about policy and investment strategies and you've seen us in the Carolinas with Renewables, with HB 589 and South Carolina with solar with Senate Bill 236, you saw the partial settlement in the DEC case and I think engagement of stakeholders is an important part of progressing any strategic objective and our approach here will be to continue to advance the dialogue in the Carolinas around grid investment. We have a number of options, more frequent rate cases, regulatory arena, legislation and we will be focusing on all of those. The strategic priority of achieving an outcome remains key to us and our work continues.","Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for answering the questions.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Lynn and Steve.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Appreciate the reiteration of the 4% to 6% and getting back into the range. I wanted to know given some of the positives that you've received over the past three or so months on the regulatory front and on the credit agency front. Has anything, kind of, changed underlying that 4% to 6% range for better or for worse or is the kind of makeup of how you're going to grow into 2019 and 2020 changed at all?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Chris, it hasn't changed. Our assignment here is to execute the plan that we've put in front of you and that's exactly what we're doing. And I think the track record we've demonstrated here in 2018, whether it's on rate case execution or tax reform resolution or the balance sheet and credit metrics, we've executed across all of those things and that process will continue. And so, we look into 2019 with investments and rate activity, Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We have a number of things that are in front of us and I would summarize our job is to execute and that's where our focus is.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, my second question is on cost cuts, kind of, underlying the plan. Clearly, you're planning on filing in the Carolinas to support the growth and you have riders in most other jurisdictions, but how important is cost cuts to, kind of, any lag catch-up or preventing any lag from opening up during that time period?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Chris, keeping a focus on productivity and cost while maintaining a focus on operational excellence and serving customers is our job every day. And as we look at what's in our plan, we're planning for O&M to be flat over the period, and have demonstrated our agility around O&M over the last several years, as we have responded to impacts in our business, and we feel like we have a good track record of doing that, and we will exercise that agility if need be. And as I said a moment ago, that's part of execution in my mind.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, so I would add that controlling O&M costs is essential every day, and it gives us headroom to make more capital investment for our customers that are beneficial at lower rates. So, we work at that every day.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And we should think about that flat over the time period as flat in every individual year or is that just an average?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I would think about it every year.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, excellent. Thanks guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Morning. So, on the FFO, congrats on the improvement, or at least the earlier kind of hitting your target.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just wanted to understand, what does that mean from a capital allocation perspective? Is that creating headroom for something you could do incremental in terms of CapEx or on the Commercial Renewables side? Just wanted to understand, what's the implication of that for the story?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think capital allocation is something, Praful, we look at every year in connection with our five-year plan. And we do have some opportunities coming up with HB 589, the Commercial business always remains. But our commitment to that balance sheet strength is also critical and maintaining within those targets is the way we manage the plan, and so we'll provide an update on capital allocation and optimization when we come to you in February with guidance. But I wouldn't share anything more specific than that at this point. Steve, any further thoughts?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I agree. We'll look at our capital plan. We have an extensive capital optimization process where we look across jurisdictions and functions and try to find the optimal placing of capital. And we'll continue that process but we'll have further updates later.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, thanks guys. And then just stepping back I think like you said Lynn, you've had a very good trajectory in 2018 with some good rate case outcomes or regulatory outcomes. Clearly your credit pressure is now behind you or mostly behind you. How are you now looking forward strategically? I get the execution is still the focus which clearly is great, but strategically is there anything else in your radar that you are thinking about that needs to be done either M&A-wise or anything else from a portfolio management perspective?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Nothing specific on portfolio management, Praful, but demonstrating organic growth is \u2013 I'd just like to emphasize that as part of execution, so this is getting this grid investment to work, it's delivering the benefits to customers, delivering returns, continuing to grow the dividend. That I would put at the top of the list of strategic priorities for the company.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey good morning everyone.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Before I get to my question, I just want to clarify if I heard you right. For grid modernization, are you suggesting that the rider would have helped, but it's not the only way and would you move forward with accelerating some of those initiatives without a potential legislative fix?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, the grid rider is not the only way, Andrew, I would say, and we will always pace our investment in a way that makes sense for the recovery strategy. That's part of capital optimization that Steve talked about a moment ago. And so, our work continues here to pursue appropriate next steps. We'll keep the dialogue going, bringing stakeholders together on the way forward. But we'll look at capital relative to the tactical plan around recovery and make the appropriate adjustments that we need to make.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, good. That's helpful. Then a two-part question on Renewables. First under HB 589, you mentioned there's that 30% cap that you could acquire beyond that cap. When might deals like that potentially be announced? Would it be at the time of the RFP decision, during construction or maybe after it begins operations?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I believe they would be after bids have been selected and winners of bids have been selected that some of those types of transactions might subsequently occur.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","When I think about September 11, RFP closes, there'll be some reviewed analysis. I would assume following that, winners would be announced subsequently. Then, we have an opportunity to perhaps purchase some. We'll see where we performed in the RFP. So, this will play out over the next couple of quarters, it's the way I would think about it Andrew.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. That's helpful. Then lastly, if I understand correctly, Shoreham was your first tax equity financing. How would you describe your appetite for more tax equity deals going forward? And how would you describe the market for it?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We do have an appetite for using tax equity in our deals. Shoreham was the first that we've executed on. And there is a market out there for tax equity. There is the tax appetite there and that's useful to us in our Commercial Renewables business. So we'll continue in that direction.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Very good. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Lynn Good, at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well thank you everyone for your questions and your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to speaking with many of you over the days and weeks to come and look forward to a successful third and fourth quarter.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Currens - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance.","As summarized on slide three, Lynn will begin with an update on our principal strategic, operational and financial activities since our last call, then Steve will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results, including updates on economic activities within our service territories, as well as conditions in Brazil.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I start today, I'd like to take a moment to introduce Doug Esamann. Doug recently joined our senior management team and will oversee our Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Florida utilities. Doug has over 30 years of experience with Duke Energy, most recently as the President of our Indiana utility. Doug's depth of regulatory experience as well as his customer and strategic focus complements our leadership team. We look forward to introducing Doug to many of you over the coming months.","Now, to the quarter. We are midway through 2015 and continue to execute our operational and strategic growth objectives while positioning the company to meet our financial objectives for the year.","This morning, we reported second quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.95, which is consistent with our plan. Our regulated and commercial businesses have performed well over the first half of the year. Additionally, we have completed the sale of the Midwest Generation and the purchase of the NCEMPA assets ahead of schedule. This has allowed us to effectively offset the challenging business environment in Brazil. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share.","In June, we completed our $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase ahead of schedule. Further, last month, we announced that the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.825 per share doubling the annual growth rate to around 4%. This increase reflects our confidence in the strength of our core business and our cash flows. Our balance sheet provides continued support for growth in the dividend. For the past 89 years, the dividend has demonstrated our commitment to delivering attractive total returns to shareholders.","I am pleased with the company's operational performance during the quarter, particularly our response to the extended heat wave in the Carolinas in June. Temperatures were in the upper 90s for much of the month and our system met the increased demand for our customers.","In June, we used a record monthly amount of natural gas, approximately 25 Bcf, surpassing the previous month high of 20 Bcf set in July of 2014. Additionally, our nuclear fleet delivered a record second quarter in terms of net megawatt hours of generation. Nuclear capacity factor was around 95% during the month of June. Lastly, our field operations teams met customer needs during the stress of the summer heat and storms. Our ability to meet extreme demand conditions demonstrates the quality of our operations.","We've made significant headway on other strategic and regulatory priorities, which I'll briefly cover on slide five. These priorities include investments in new generation, infrastructure and a focus on environmental compliance.","Beginning with our investments in new generation. Just last week, we closed on the $1.25 billion acquisition of jointly owned generating assets from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. We closed ahead of schedule, after receiving the required approval sooner than expected. This reflects the mutually beneficial nature of the acquisition and the widespread support we received here in North Carolina. We immediately began supplying power to the 32 municipalities through a long-term wholesale contract. In 2015, we expect a $0.04 earnings per share benefit based upon an expected full year EPS impact of around $0.07 to $0.08.","During the second quarter, we also announced the $1.1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project. This project includes the early retirement of our Asheville coal plant, which will be replaced by a new 650 megawatt combined-cycle gas plant. We will also build new transmission assets that will improve reliability in the region. Finally, we will install solar generation at the site. The new gas plant is expected in service by the end of 2019 and the entire project will likely be completed by 2020.","Before construction begins, various regulators including the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Carolinas Utility Commissions will need to approve the plan.","Our commercial renewables business continues to deliver on its capital growth projects. In April, we completed the 200-megawatt Los Vientos III project in South Texas, which is now delivering power under a long-term contract with Austin Energy.","In July, we announced acquisitions of an additional 70 megawatts of solar capacity in California and North Carolina. Our commercial renewables business now has more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity in operation.","In July, FERC approved our application to acquire the 599 megawatt combined-cycle Osprey gas plant in Florida from Calpine. The Florida Public Service Commission also voted to approve the acquisition. We remain on track to close by January of 2017 when our existing PPA with Calpine terminates and we have a need for additional generation capacity.","Also in Florida, we announced an agreement to purchase a 7.5% stake in the Sabal Trail gas pipeline from Spectra Energy for $225 million. Similar to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the Sabal Trail investment will be a part of Duke's Commercial portfolio. The pipeline is expected in service by the end of 2017 and will serve the growing natural gas needs in the state, including our 1,640 megawatt Citrus County combined-cycle plant, which is expected to be online in 2018. Duke Energy Florida and Florida Power & Light have entered into 25-year capacity agreements with the pipeline.","Moving to Indiana, in May, we received an order from the Indiana Commission on the transmission and distribution infrastructure plan. The Commission denied our proposed $1.9 billion investment because they would like to see greater detail. We are working on a revised plan, which we expect to file with the Commission by the end of 2015. Modernizing our electric grid will provide great benefits to customers in Indiana, ultimately increasing reliability, decreasing the duration of power outages and improving customer communication.","In the second quarter, we made significant progress on coal ash management activities. In May, we began moving ash at our River Bend site in North Carolina after receiving state permits. We are now excavating ash at three sites in the Carolinas.","In June, we announced recommendations to fully excavate 12 additional ash basins in North Carolina, bringing the total ash in the Carolinas we have slated for excavation to about 30%. The remaining ash basins are being further studied to determine appropriate closure methods.","We are pursuing solutions that balance safety, environmental stewardship and cost effectiveness. Given our efforts over the past year, we are ahead of the curve in adapting to changing regulations our industry faces with ash management.","On the subject of environmental rules, on Monday, the U.S. EPA finalized a Clean Power Plan, a regulation aimed at reducing carbon emissions from existing power plants 32% by 2030. The guidelines issued this week are more than 1,500 pages long and among the more complex rules in recent history.","This rule sets state specific reduction targets and builds upon the substantial progress we have already made to reduce our environmental footprint. Since 2005, we have reduced our total carbon dioxide emissions by 22% through retirement of older coal units, the transition to cleaner burning natural gas, as well as investments in renewables and energy efficiency.","Our plans continue to move us toward a lower carbon future. We will work constructively with our states to identify solutions that preserve the reliability and affordability our customers expect. As we continue to modernize our system, managing energy diversity will be an important consideration.","As I look back over the first half of 2015, I am pleased with what we've accomplished on multiple fronts across the business. I'm even more pleased with the groundwork we're laying for the years ahead.","We're making strategic long-term investments that will benefit our customers and communities, in addition to supporting growth for shareholders. We're developing and executing strategies that will position the company well in a rapidly changing industry.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I'll review our second quarter financial results and discuss the economic conditions in our service territories. I will also provide an update on the accounting and expected costs for our coal ash management activities, and review our results in Brazil.","Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide six. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.","As Lynn mentioned, we achieved second quarter adjusted diluted earnings of $0.95 per share, compared to $1.11 in the second quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, 2015 second quarter earnings per share were $0.78 compared to $0.86 last year. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials to today's presentation.","Regulated Utilities adjusted results declined by $0.09 per share, primarily due to a prior year favorable state tax settlement, planned timing of O&M cost, and higher depreciation and amortization. O&M cost increased this quarter due to the planned timing of outages across the generation fleet, and approximately $0.05 due to nuclear outage cost levelization impacts recognized in the prior year. This is the last quarter in which we expect nuclear outage cost levelization to be a significant driver over the prior year results. We are on track to achieve our targeted full-year O&M budget, and continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs.","These negative drivers were partially offset by higher margins, resulting from growth in wholesale contracts and weather normal retail sales. We had favorable weather in the quarter, as a significant heat wave gripped the Carolinas in June. Weather added around $0.03 over last year's second quarter, and $0.06 compared to normal conditions.","We also experienced higher earnings of $0.03 this quarter from pricing and riders, primarily due to increased energy efficiency programs. International's quarterly earnings declined $0.13 over last year, due to factors we continue to monitor, including the economic conditions and lower demand for electricity in Brazil. As you will recall, International also had a favorable income tax adjustment of $0.07 in last year's quarter, associated with the reorganization of our operations in Chile.","Our Commercial Portfolio, formerly Commercial Power, is primarily made up of our commercial renewables business. In the second quarter, we incurred slightly lower earnings due to lower wind production. This decrease in wind production was experienced broadly across the United States.","Turning to slide seven, I'll now provide some insight into the second half of 2015, and the key drivers that give us confidence in our 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 is consistent with our plan. The regulated business has experienced favorable weather, and has seen strong growth in wholesale contracts and weather normal retail sales. The sale of the Midwest Generation fleet, as a whole, has been favorable to our plan in the first half of the year. These positive drivers have helped offset continued weakness at International.","In order to achieve our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range, we expect higher EPS contributions in the back half of the year, over what we earned in the comparable period last year. There are a few primary drivers that support this. First, we expect continued growth in contracted wholesale volumes, as well as organic growth in retail demand over the last half of the year. Second, we experienced unfavorable weather last year in the third quarter. Assuming normal weather for the remainder of this year provides an uplift of $0.05.","Third, the early completion of the NCEMPA asset purchase will provide an additional earnings per share impact of around $0.04. Earnings from our Commercial renewables business should also see an improvement in the second half of the year. We are on track to put over 200 megawatts of additional wind and solar capacity into service later this year, which would bring 2015's total additions to more than 400 megawatts.","Related to O&M cost, we expect third quarter O&M to be higher than the prior year, while fourth quarter should be lower. As a result, O&M shouldn't be a significant driver in the second half of the year. Similarly, we expect International's earnings contribution in the second half of 2015 to be comparable to last year. This is not a full list of drivers for the rest of the year, but these represent variances that are likely to occur, based on current expectations. As you are all aware, the third quarter is historically our strongest quarter. We will be in a position to provide more insight into the year after we see those results.","Moving on to slide eight, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load growth increased by positive 0.1%, driven by strong second quarter growth of positive 1.7%. This was the first quarter we have experienced positive growth across all customer classes in over a year. Although one quarter does not make a trend, this recent uptick is encouraging.","Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the same period last year. The growth in the Carolinas and Florida regions has been particularly strong, at around 1.5%. The Carolinas and Florida also saw usage per customer level off, after trending lower over the past several quarters.","We continue to see favorable trends in the key indicators for the residential sector including, employment, median incomes and household formations. In fact, the 6 states we serve captured over 20% of the additional nonfarm job growth over the last year.","The commercial sector grew by 0.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. This sector continues to benefit from declining office vacancy rates, and expansion in the medical and restaurant subsectors. We've also experienced some growth in the tourism related businesses, in certain markets.","The industrial sector grew by 1.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. This growth was led by metals, transportation, construction and chemicals. Additionally, we are starting to see textiles in the Carolinas build momentum. We will continue to monitor the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on manufacturing activity.","Our economic development teams remain active, successfully helping attract new business investments into our service territories. So far this year, these activities have led to the announcement of another $1.7 billion in capital investments, which is expected to result in over 5,000 new jobs, across our six states.","We are encouraged by the continued strengthening of the economy, particularly in the Southeast. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2015 weather normalized load growth of between 0.5% and 1%.","Moving on to slide nine. Let me update you on our coal ash management activities. First I'll cover adjustments to our asset retirement obligations related to coal ash basin closures. As you'll recall, in the third quarter 2014, we recorded an approximate $3.5 billion ARO, reflecting our best estimate to comply with the newly enacted Coal Ash Management Act or CAMA.","In April, the U.S. EPA published its final Coal Combustion Residuals Rule in the Federal Register. The EPA's final rule is consistent with our compliance plan for basins in North Carolina under CAMA. However, the final rule did create a legal obligation related to ash basins outside of North Carolina and existing landfills across our system. Therefore during the second quarter, we recorded an additional $1 billion obligation representing our best estimate of cost to comply with the new Federal EPA rules.","As of June 30, we now have total ARO obligations of $4.5 billion, which represents our best estimate to comply with state and Federal rules. These costs will be spent over the next several decades. We will continue to refine this estimated liability as plans are finalized.","Next, let me summarize our cash spending assumptions for our coal ash activities. In February, we estimated $1.3 billion in spending from 2015 to 2019, to close the initial high-priority sites under CAMA. During the quarter we announced our recommendation to fully excavate 12 additional basins in the Carolinas.","Our estimate of cost to close these additional basins ranges between $700 million to $1 billion. Ultimately, we expect these costs will increase our five year capital spending plan that was disclosed in February. However, we are unable to predict the precise timing under which we will incur these costs until the final risk classification is set by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Coal Ash Commission. We will continue to provide updates as our plans become finalized. There is still work to do with our remaining basins and we will keep you updated as we continue to refine our estimates.","Taking a look at slide 10. Let me provide an update on our International business. As we entered the year, we anticipated challenges at International due to one, the prolonged drought conditions in Brazil, causing thermals to dispatch of hydros for the entire year. Two, unfavorable Brazilian foreign exchange rates. Three, declining earnings contributions from our interest in National Methanol, which sells products that are correlated to Brent crude oil prices. And four, a prior year Chilean tax benefit.","We also assume no energy rationing and around 2% growth in demand for electricity. During 2015, reservoir levels continue to be low. Rainfall has recently been above average in the Southeast region of Brazil, where our assets are located. Reservoir levels stood at about 37% at the end of July, higher than the 20% level they started the year. However, they are still low for this time of the year. These conditions have caused the system operator to continue to dispatch thermals ahead of hydros. Additionally, the government is continuing to encourage customers to voluntarily reduce electricity consumption.","The economy in Brazil continues to weaken as evidenced by S&Ps recent change in outlook for the country's credit ratings. The softer Brazilian economy, higher tariff prices for end users and the voluntary conservation measures have placed additional pressure on electricity demand so far in 2015. As a result, we now expect 2015 electricity demand in Brazil to be lower than 2014.","Taking this all into account through the second quarter of 2015, International's earnings have declined by $0.26 per share, compared to last year. As you will recall, our original full year forecast of International contemplated about $0.12 per share of lower year-over-year earnings. We do not expect these levels of year-over-year weakness to continue into the second half of 2015.","We expect the third and fourth quarters to be more comparable to the second half of 2014 for the following reasons: First, the system operator began to change the dispatch order to the detriment of hydro generators in the second quarter of 2014. So in the second half of 2015, generation dispatch order will be similar to what it was in the second half of 2014.","Second, the shaping of our contract should create a less significant short position in the second half of the year than we saw last year.","Finally, we have seen recent declines in the market settlement prices or PLD. In June and July, these prices fell below the established ceiling of R$388, averaging approximately R$300 per megawatt hour. These lower spot prices should provide some relief as we continue to cover our short position through market purchases, helping offset the impact of lower demand. Our International team continues to manage well in this difficult environment, concentrating on items within their control. We actively are managing our ongoing contracted levels and focusing on our cost management during this downturn. However, we do not expect International to meet its original financial plan for the full year.","Before moving on, let me mention a recent development in Brazil that has received some media attention. There have been recent discussions aimed at providing some financial relief to the hydro generators. These discussions are in the early stages and it is difficult to speculate on how they may play out. We'll keep you updated as events unfold.","Slide 11 outlines our financial objectives. The balance sheet is strong and our credit ratings are in line with our target levels, allowing the company to access the financial markets on reasonable terms. We are executing our plan to access $2.7 billion of international cash over several years. In June, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to the U.S. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows helps fuel our growth strategy, support the dividend and maintain low cost rates for our customers.","Our dividend continues to be a very important piece of our shareholder value proposition. In July, we were pleased to announce an increase in our quarterly dividend growth rate from 2% to approximately 4%. In 2010, we have been working to reach our target payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted EPS. Now that we are at the high end of that ratio, we will continue to target dividend growth more in line with our long-term earnings growth targets.","Let me provide an update on our earnings growth objectives, both short term and long term. We are on track to achieve our 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Near-term headwinds at the International business have been offset by strength in Regulated Utilities and early execution on some of our strategic initiatives.","On a longer term basis, we continue to target earnings per share growth of 4% to 6%, underpinned by the strength of our domestic businesses. We are executing on our strategic growth initiatives, which provides a foundation for growth through 2017 and beyond.","Our International business however, continues to face unfavorable macroeconomic trends such as poor hydrological conditions and a weakened economy in Brazil. As we look beyond 2015, the extent and duration of these challenges is uncertain. We will learn more as the year progresses, and we'll evaluate the longer term impacts as we finalize our financial plans for 2016 and beyond. We remain committed to delivering long-term value for our investors.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will first go to Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Dan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. On the load growth numbers in the second quarter, I guess both customer gains, weather adjusted usage, both looked pretty good and kind of broke from trend that we've seen the last couple quarters. Should we read much into things getting better and this being perpetuated or this is just kind of the \u2013 some of the volatility that comes with quarterly adjustments in numbers?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, Dan, as we said, I'm always careful when I just look at one quarter's results. I think we have to always have that in the back of our mind. We are seeing some pretty good trends here, though on a few factors that I will mention. The growth of customers into the Carolinas and Florida has been ramping up from 1% now to 1.5% and that's got to be a good metric there for the future as we move forward.","We're also seeing some favorable statistics when we look at new housing starts in our service territories, meaning new homes are starting to get actually built. We're also starting to see a lower number of rejections of mortgage applications which say that people are having the funds to buy a home or a place to live, some of those statistics are certainly compelling. We're always cautiously optimistic on one quarter, but there are some good results here.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And Dan, one thing I would add that Steve talked about in the script, we've been tracking lower usage per customer kind of quarter-after-quarter and actually, saw a leveling-off of that reduction this quarter as well, which is another thing that I would point to as a bit of a new trend for us.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","When we think about the load growth and you guys were at 0.5% to 1%, this year, I know you've kind of talked about 1% being more of a normalized long-term target. How important is getting to that 1% number to the utilities being able to support their end of the 4% to 6% growth target?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","It's important, Dan. As you know on our sensitivity, a 1% increase in our organic load growth would translate to about 2% earnings growth, and it is essential to us to see growth in our service areas.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The trends you're seeing right now, are they giving you encouragement that that 1% is feeling a little bit better, after maybe feeling a bit shaky the last couple quarters?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, as I mentioned, I think some of these trends behind the good quarter we had in the second quarter do make us feel well. As Lynn mentioned, the usage decline stopping per customer and some of the raw data on employment, median household income starting to pick-up and get a bit of traction in our service territories, do give us some comfort there.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I'm sure that folks are going to ask about it, but just on the international side. Looking past this year, are you guys thinking that things that are happening this year are structural, or do you think they're situational to these market conditions?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Dan, I think there are a combination of things going on. The hydrological conditions, I believe were seasonal, right. So, if we have a strong rainy season that starts in the fall, continuing into 2016, we may see a situation where dispatch order changes. I think the regulatory body in Brazil has learned a lot about the changing generation mix and how that fleet has reacted in this environment. So, over maybe a short-term to medium-term, we could see some mitigation of some of the pressures there, or changes in regulation that could be helpful to the hydro operators.","I think the long-term issues are more around the Brazilian economy. And does the Brazilian economy get traction again, and start growing at a pace that would be more consistent with what we have seen over the last decade? So, I think you've got a combination of shorter-term and medium-term to longer term issues. And so, our focus is to be as transparent as we can on what we see, and we'll continue to update you as the year progresses.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Steve, I think you sort of touched on this in your prepared remarks, but on the injunctions in Brazil, is there preliminary, is there any procedural process that we could follow to see how things are transpiring?","And then the second question is, Brazil does have relatively high rates. So is there any talk on how \u2013 the potential of passing these costs onto customers?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Shar, on the injunctions, in talking with our teams in Brazil, I don't know that there is a set timeframe or schedule that you can look to to determine resolution of this. I think these initial injunctions and discussions around the market by various stakeholder groups are a positive step.","But we expect that it will take quite a bit of time to resolve this issue and get new processes and settlements in place. So that's just the nature of the way these negotiations often go in Brazil. So I wouldn't look for a timeframe there.","Regarding Brazilian retail rates, they did jump up quite a bit over the past year. And certainly that is something that is on the minds of Brazilian politicians, as to, how do we deal with the cost of this out of dispatch situation due to the hydrology issues? And right now, the hydro generators are bearing a lot of that burden, and the customers have borne some burden as well. That's part of the debate that will be worked upon over the next year or so in Brazil.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. And then, on slide 11, you added a new footnote, footnote 3. Just curious, this footnote, is it basically inferring that the 4% to 6% is embedding some of the challenges you're seeing in the International business, or it's sort of pending some of the challenges that you're seeing in the International business?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Shar, what I would say is, given the depth of the challenge we've experienced during the first six months, and the fact that we've seen hydrological conditions, really coupled with some of the complexities around other economic factors, including Petrobras and other things going on in Brazil. That the duration of this challenge is uncertain to us as we look past 2015.","So when we look at the back half, we believe the back half of 2015 will be reasonably comparable to 2014. We'll be anxious to see how the rainy season begins, but we need more information and time to look at our forecast for 2016 and 2017. And so, we wanted to just provide some transparency on that, and that's the \u2013 really consistent with the remarks we shared with you today.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, weaker wind resources was a little bit of a theme this quarter. Is this something that we should think about from a structural standpoint, just given that the El Ni\u00f1o cycle is just starting, or is this something that's sort of a bit of an anomaly?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I don't know that I've heard anybody profess to understand the wind patterns that well, Shar, that they could predict them. So I don't know that it's anything more than an anomaly now. We're heading into the second half of the year, where the wind traditionally picks up. So we'll get a better idea after that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Greg.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, I just wanted to go over some of the things you said, just to make sure I understand them in terms of looking on actually slide 14, which is your original assumptions put up against your year-to-date results. It looks like you're basically telling us that if International is flat in the second half versus the second half last year, that you're $0.10 behind plan.","On the other hand, you're saying you're $0.04 ahead of plan at the utility because of the early close of the NCEMPA acquisition and then you're also \u2013 see better results in the second half versus the second half of last year in the Commercial business because of the 400 megawatts of new renewables and that's how you sort of get back to plan. Is that a reasonable summary of what you said or am I missing something?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I think you've hit on some of the elements there. Assuming normal weather over the last half of the year, and we have had warm weather in July, you get a pick up there. Certainly, the wholesale contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition provides about $0.04 there. We've also seen growth in our retail load year-over-year, even at modest percents that can add several cents to it. If it stayed like the second quarter's results, it would be more than that. Our wholesale business has also picked up through new contracts with co-ops and munis in the Carolinas and in Florida in particular. So, those are some of the things that we look to to continue provide growth over the second half of the year.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And, Greg...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. I understand that. I guess to clarify my question, many of those things were baked into the $2.95 billion budget.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I assume normal weather was baked in there. The wholesale pickup was \u2013 you were very, very clear on in your disclosures on the expectation there. So, I'm just focused on what's changed from the plan. I guess you're a little bit ahead of normal going into July which is good, NCEMPA closed early which is good. So, I'd really like to circle back to your answer and focus on what's changed that's not in the plan. $0.04 from NCEMPA...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, let me give it a try.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Greg, let me \u2013 so, if we step back from this, as we started the year, we expected the back half to be stronger than the first half from the get-go. And then, if you look at the first half of the year, the weakness in Brazil has basically been offset by strength in the regulated business. We had weather that was strong and comparable to last year, even a bit ahead. We had an early closing in the Midwest Generation sale, which gives us incremental.","When you go to the back half, we expect the back half to be stronger, wholesale growth, retail growth. Our O&M outage was more in the first half than the second half. And then, we have the sweetener of the NCEMPA transaction closing. And so, the weakness that we offset in the first half with weather and strong results, we don't expect to see in the back half because we think Brazil will be comparable to 2014.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And that 400 megawatts...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Does that help?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...of new renewables coming in, in the back half of the year is baked into your $185 million plan or is that stuff...?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","It is.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, it is.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. That's much clearer. Thank you very much. Have a good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Julien.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, perhaps to follow-up on Greg's question just a little bit and be clear. First, where do you stand in the context of 2015, if you can specify? And then, perhaps more broadly as you think about the 4% to 6%, is there any thought or expectation to update that and specifically rebase at any point or how do you think about that given where you stand on hydro and obviously 2015 is \u2013 could be a weather event related, but I'd be curious if you want to just elaborate on the 4% to 6% at this point too?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, Julien, we are on plan through the first half. And for the reasons we just discussed, we're confident we'll remain within the range of $4.55 to $4.75. In terms of guidance, our current thinking is that we will approach that in the same way we always do. So, you'll have February of 2016 for 2016 and for the longer-term outlook. We will continue to update you in third quarter on any further developments we see in any part of the business as we also normally do. So that's the schedule we're thinking about at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But perhaps just more specifically, rebasing, is there any thought process of rebasing the base year of that 4% to 6% at all?","And then, perhaps the second bigger picture question if you will, with regards to the Clean Power Plan and I know, obviously incredibly complex as you already alluded to. Could you elaborate how the company is positioning to capture opportunities there and obviously you're involved in many of the key angles that would benefit in theory from the CPP, but could you elaborate how you are thinking about taking advantage of each of those respective niches?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And on rebasing, Julien, we're anchored in 2013 at this point. We will rebase at some point. We haven't made a final decision on that and we'll update guidance in February of 2016.","The Clean Power Plan appreciates those questions and we are continuing to digest, we do not have a definitive plan in any of our jurisdictions. Of course it will impact our IRP planning, and impact our thinking on state-by-state. As I'm sure you're aware, the plan did change emission reduction targets. So we have more stringent targets in the Midwest. We have moderately less stringent targets in the Southeast, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.","There's a notion being introduced of a market trading platform, which is new, which we'll need to evaluate, and then the compliance period with these incentive credits and so on, in 2020, 2021, I think, will also be something that we digest. So, we're beginning to understand the elements, I think there is flexibility here. It will be important to involve a stakeholder and state process. These are the states' implementation plans ultimately. But we believe that much as we've delivered consistent carbon reductions over the last 10 years, we'll be looking for a way to continue progress in that direction, at the lowest cost to our customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Lynn. A couple questions. First, just specific details. So, I think you guys said, you expect it to be $0.12 down in 2015 in International versus 2014 and in the first half, you're down $0.26. So, assuming it's flat the rest of the year, that means you're kind of off by about $0.14 from plan. Could you maybe just break up, what makes up that $0.14, how much is it below average? How much is it the hydro versus some of the other, the economy or currency or other things, at least a rough cut of that?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Steve. The bulk of that is \u2013 and you're just talking about International, the delta in International?","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","From the original expectations versus where we're at now, is that correct?","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. The biggest difference that we're seeing is the impact of informal rationing, if you will, and the weak economy, those two impacts on the demand for power in Brazil. When we set up our assumptions in February, we stated we had no assumption of informal rationing and we had over 2% demand growth. And now what we're seeing is that the demand is actually slightly negative. Because thermals are dispatched first, all of that delta, all of that swing comes out of hydros. And of course, we're a hydro owner here. So that is the big difference that we did not have in the $0.12 downtick for International back in February. And we stated we didn't have any view on rationing in the numbers if rationing came about or lower demand, the results would be lower. So that is by far the bulk of the difference in International.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Steve, one thing I might just point out, Chile, the Chilean tax adjustment that was reflected in second quarter of 2014 is $0.07 of that $0.26 that was planned. We were aware of it. And the additional weakness is in Brazil and NMC [National Methanol Company], the oil prices have deteriorated slightly, but we saw a lot of that at the beginning of the year. And then all the conditions, we've talked about here on further weakening in Brazil is where the larger challenge has originated.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So when we think about beyond 2015 and if we made the jump that hydro might actually normalize. The issues outside of that are primarily related to the economy, I assume somewhat currency and are those two main issues?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think those are two main issues, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Any thoughts to reconsider strategic alternatives for the business?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Steve, that's a question we've spent a fair amount of time on as you imagine. We thought our process and I still believe our process last year was a good one, very thorough. We were looking at growth, we were looking at cash and we solved the cash, which we believe is important to supporting the dividend. We've already brought home, $1.2 billion of that $2.7 billion. There is no question we're operating in a challenging environment, and all of the factors we talked about today are something that the team in International is focused on. I am pleased with the way they've responded to these challenging conditions. And at this point, I don't have anything further to share on how we think about this business strategically, but we've certainly learned a lot about volatility in this business as a result of these recent events, and that'll factor into our planning in the future.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one last question maybe at a high level. Between the balance sheet and position you have now, and things like the securitization coming in Florida some point soon, how much available cash or balance sheet capacity do you have for investment in growth opportunities, right now?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, we have a solid balance sheet and we have a number of growth opportunities, where our capital spend is typically in the neighborhood of $7 billion a year. So, there is...","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm sorry. I want to make sure \u2013 I mean above kind of what you're planning to do right now? So, like if you had opportunities that go above the current investment plan?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We do.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And how much upside? Yeah. Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We haven't quantified that specifically. The one thing I would say, Steve, is if you look at the leverage in the business, the utilities are situated relative to their cap structure that they earn on, capacity sits at the holding company and we're probably at 27%, 28% of HoldCo debt. There's probably capacity at HoldCo, up to 30% or maybe a little bit above, depending on how the credit rating agencies look at that. So, can't quantify it any more specifically than that, but we're committed to our ratings. We think we have an incredibly strong balance sheet with flexibility, to address what we think the business requires. And we'll continue to manage that accordingly.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And how much will you get from securitization?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We will get about $1.3 billion from the securitization process. We're targeting the first quarter of 2016 to get those funds. About half of those funds will be used to displace Florida \u2013 Duke Energy Florida OpCo debt, the other half of the funds will come up to the parent.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You kind of mentioned in your prepared remarks, and then in response to an earlier question that, it's too early to tell what's going to happen potentially with GSF reform (49:07) in Brazil, and I can definitely appreciate that. But, do you have at least a sense as to what the EPS impact would be there, if we went from say a 20% now to a 10% or a 5% protection type level, just versus normal in any given full year?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We don't have any sensitivities on that, Chris. There is a lot of variables here. Where is our contracted load? What is the PLD price? So there is just variables there that are too multiple for us to try to put a metric on.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And I think...","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","...as we get to a point of clarity on the way the courts and the way the regulation will change, we'll be in a position to give you a better sense of timing, what our contracted position is, where we're forecasting PLD. But it's premature to do that at this point, because there are too many moving parts.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just kind of going back to the 2016 and beyond picture, it's still pretty early here to talk about any potential growth guidance changes. But I just wanted to address maybe balance sheet capacity, like we were talking about on the last question, or just your ability to do other things, outside of what you've already talked about, whether it's accelerating more repatriation of cash or doing other securitizations, outside of the Florida one that you already have in plans, or maybe pulling forward Carolina's rate cases earlier than the 2017 to 2018 timeframe that you're currently thinking about right now?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","In connection with our planning process, Chris, we'll look at every element of the business to ensure we're delivering as much value as we can. I think we've demonstrated an ability to identify investment projects that are beneficial to customers and also delivering returns to shareholders. We do have flexibility in the balance sheet for additional investment. So, we'll be evaluating all of those alternatives in connection with our business planning process.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But at this time, nothing is seeming more likely than not, or nothing's standing out in your mind?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. Nothing that I would share at this point.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just wanted...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...to revisit \u2013 hi, Lynn. Just wanted to revisit a few things on the Regulated side of the house. First of all, can you remind us, for the spend you do on coal ash in North Carolina, what the cost recovery process is; meaning, how do you actually \u2013 how, and more importantly when, do you actually get this in rates?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, Michael. There is no definitive plan for collection of the coal ash in rates. We spent about $100 million to-date on this, and that will ramp up over the next several years. And the way this will work, we'll start spending and acting on our plans in conjunction with CAMA over the next several years. And then, at some point, an appropriate point, we can go in for a rate case, and we can incorporate coal ash spend into that rate case. So we have flexibility there, there is no set timeframe for this.","And you might look in time, and think about the next rate case, being associated with the completion of a large power plant, a combined cycle or completion of a lot of nuclear work in the Duke Energy Progress area. That might put you in the later part of the teens, for going in for a rate increase.","At that point in time, we would probably request an increment in base rates for coal ash recovery. And the Commission would then begin to monitor coal ash cost recovered through rates versus coal ash spent and adjust it from there; this is not like a normal capital project, where you spend over in a short intense period and then are completed, the spend will go on for a long time. So I think it will have that type of nature of recovery to it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","There is precedent in North Carolina for more real-time recovery of environmental cost, thinking back to like Clean Smokestacks from a number of years ago. Just curious, is there an opportunity, whether via regulation or via legislation \u2013 and I'm not sure which one it would require \u2013 to get more real-time recovery of coal ash spend, and more kind of the certainty of recovery over time?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Michael. I'll take that one. I think North Carolina has demonstrated over a long period of time recovery of mandated cost and certainly coal ash, whether it's at a state level or Federal level, those are required costs of decommissioning the plants.","I don't see in the next year or two, any change in the recovery mechanism that Steve just described and given the magnitude of the spend that we're talking about, I think that's reasonable. So, we'll be addressing it in connection with the general rate case and evaluating what else might make sense over time.","I think about Clean Power Plan, I think about \u2013 we have trackers for renewables. There are a variety of events that could trigger consideration of other forms of recovery. But I don't see coal ash as being one that would \u2013 we would approach as a single item at this point.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. One last question on utility O&M. Did I hear correctly that what you're basically saying is, O&M levels in the second half of 2015 will be flat to second half 2014?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. That's correct, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When you look at broader O&M, what are you \u2013 at the Regulated businesses and especially in the Carolinas \u2013 what do you see as potential \u2013 you're a couple of years out post-merger, but continued cost saving opportunities to where instead of flat, it's even potentially down?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Some of the cost savings opportunities that we are now pursuing are the rollout of work management systems. We've already done a lot the corporate work. We've rolled out work management systems in the fossil area. We've done a lot of nuclear work. But now we're rolling out into T&D and that's more dispersed in asset location and employee workforce. So, that's an area that is ripe for some benefits. So, we'll continue to roll these projects out and have some opportunities here to offset some of the cost increases that we face, such as cyber security, normal inflation, Fukushima and that kind of thing, but I do believe there are efficiency opportunities still out there.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Steve, and much appreciated.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry to revisit this, but you've said a couple of times, you want to be clear about and transparent about what you're saying on growth. And I just on this \u2013 we've already talked about the footnote on the slide around long-term earnings growth. You also changed the word you're using from deliver to target. And I'd hate to read too much into that, but I just \u2013 Lynn, are we saying that if International kind of doesn't rebound post-2015 in a decent way that you may not be able to stay at the low end of the 4% to 6% or are we not saying that? I'm not feeling I heard the clarity.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. And you know, Jonathan, I'm not trying to reset guidance range at this point. But I am trying to flag for you that we see uncertainty in the International business that is difficult sitting here in early August of 2015 to predict duration and extent. And so, a rebound, if we see a rebound in 2017, that's certainly positive. But it's more challenging today than I would have said to you it was in January of this year and that's what we're trying to signal or trying to say. And we'll continue to update you as we see rainy season starting to develop and we see any potential changes in the regulatory scheme, the injunctions and other things, but it's more challenging based on what we see right now.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And again, apologies for the revisit.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","No. That's fine. Great.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","All right.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi. Listen, with regards to the securitization proceeds, Steve, you said half of them will be used for OpCo debt reduction, half going to the parent. Any thoughts on how that other half gets used? The reason I ask is on the original settlement agreement you were going to be earning an ROE on it, granted it was a 30% reduction, but there was earnings coming from that and so is there a dilutive potential given securitization that may not have been part of the original plan. Is that a fair way to think about this?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","You're correct there. We are giving up the equity return that was baked into the Crystal River 3 recovery mechanism from the settlement in 2013, albeit it was a haircut return. Whether it's dilutive or not depends upon the redeployment of the proceeds here. And again we will be looking for growth opportunities to help replace that equity return loss.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","So at this point you would not assume that that is used for any HoldCo debt reduction. It probably goes into some rate base kind of investment?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, it will move into our general funds and help fund growth. Ideally we'd like to find an investment to put it right into, but certainly it will be utilized to reduce HoldCo debt that then helps fund other acquisitions, other purchases, other investments more efficiently.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And Ali, what I would say to that, we haven't earmarked a specific investment for those funds, but there have been a lot of questions today about holding company capacity for additional investment, this would be part of that. And so our objective will be to deploy that in a way that maximizes the value.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah. And Lynn, what's the latest on the Edwardsport investigation in Indiana? Is that still out there? I thought it should have been done by now. What's the latest?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So there is a rate proceeding in front of the Indiana Commission, Ali, on the regulatory every six month rider mechanisms as well as the fuel clauses. And we would expect an order from the Commission before the end of the year, perhaps even as early as the third quarter. So, that does remain out there. In the slide deck we've given you kind of a chart of what the open proceedings are, I think it's on slide 21 just to give you a sense of where these are.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Yeah, I thought it was a summer timeframe, I guess it's a little later.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think it's a little later. Yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And last question, the timeline for some of you investments, you've made that investment in the pipeline and you've got the other bigger pipeline out there. Are you thinking, Lynn, when you update your long-term growth rates perhaps next year, that you may stretch it out over a five-year period as opposed to the three-year periods that we've been doing currently, given that some of the stuff won't hit until later in the decade?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, it's a good question, we debate the period internally. We had a longer term one, we moved it to three years, five years is a possibility. But I think the point you're making is a good one, which is infrastructure investment occurs over a longer period of time. So, we haven't made a final decision on that, but we are \u2013 we will evaluate it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for closing remarks.","Lynn J.

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now pleasure to introduce your host Bill Currens, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.","Bill Currens","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's third quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our Web site at duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the Company's performance.","As summarized on Slide 3, Lynn will cover our third quarter highlights and provide summary of our recent strategic and growth initiatives. Then Steve will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and an update on our economic activities within our service territories, as well as an overview of our earnings growth prospects as we move into 2016 in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This morning reported third quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $1.47 per share above the $1.40 per share in 2014, as favorable weather and growth in the regulating utilities supported our results. Our regulated businesses have performed well throughout 2015 delivering solid financial results. As we look to the fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $4.55 to $4.65 per share. This range reflects mild October weather, as well as storm expenses, unfavorable foreign currency trends and the potential for extending bonus depreciation. The extension of bonus will modestly increase our effective tax for the year.","Earlier this year, we increase the growth rate of the dividend to approximately 4%, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our core businesses. The growing dividend supports our commitment to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders. Our financial results are made possible by the efforts of our people who work every day to keep our plant safe, efficient and reliable, providing our customers with valuable services. Our regulated generation fleet continued to deliver for customers during the critical summer months. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 97% capacity factor during the quarter and our growing regulated gas fleet continued to deliver value for our customers, taking advantage of the low natural gas prices.","In fact our utilities have burned more natural gas in the first nine months of 2015 than they did in either of the two prior full years. The Edwardsport IGCC plant continues to operate well, achieving a third quarter gasifier availability factor of around 80%, massing the first quarter\u2019s record. Additionally in July, the facility achieved a record month of net generation.","In early October, we experienced heavy rains and flooding in the Carolinas and 500,000 customer outages. We were well prepared and mobilized our crudes in advance, speeding the restoration of service. Like others in the industry we are making progress towards a safe, cost effective closure of our Ash Basins in the Carolinas. Basin closure is underway at six sites and we are working through the approval of closure plans at our remaining basins. I\u2019m proud of the way the Duke team has responded to this important industry issue with excellence and leadership.","We are systematically and strategically increasing our regulated business mix through a series of acquisitions and divestitures as highlighted on Slide 5. As well as the portfolio of investments I will discuss in a moment. Last week, we were very excited to announce the plan to acquire Piedmont Natural Gas, which will add a well established natural gas business and platforms in the Duke portfolio. From a strategic perspective, we see this acquisition as the foundation for establishing a broader gas infrastructure platform within Duke, building upon our recent gas pipeline investments and complementing our existing gas LBT business in the Midwest. We plan to leverage the scale Duke with Piedmont\u2019s well regarded management team and excellent operational capabilities.","Piedmont has long been recognized as a premier operator of low risk regulated gas infrastructure. We have partnered with them over many years, as they have built and operated the critical gas infrastructure that serves natural gas generation in this region. Piedmont is experiencing robust customer growth and is investing in projects that have constructive regulatory mechanisms providing a strong base to organic growth. These investments are expected to grow their rate base, by an average of around 9% over the coming years.","This acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2016 and be accretive to our earnings in the first full year after close. This will increase our total regulated business mix to over 90%, firmly supporting our earnings and dividend growth objectives. We will keep you updated, as we progress through the approval process.","Turning to Slide 6. We are also focused on creating long-term growth and value for our customers and shareholders, with investments that will modernize our system, both our generation and our growth for the benefit of our customers. We continue to introduce more diversity to our fleet through low cost natural gas. Construction has begun on a combined cycle natural gas plant at the lease site in South Carolina, while preconstruction activities will commence on the Citrus County combined-cycle plant later this year. Both projects represent a total of over 2 billion in investments and remain on-time and on-budget.","Our Western Carolina modernization project also remains on track. You may recall that we decided to retire our coal unit in Asheville and replaced it with a combined-cycle gas plant and a new transmission line, to improve reliability and support growth in the Asheville area. After working through a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process over the course for the summer, we announced yesterday a modified set of resources to support this project, eliminating the need for a new transmission line.","Rather than the 650 megawatt gas plant, we will build two 280 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas units with the option for 190 megawatt simple cycle unit by 2023. A total estimated investment of just over $1 billion. This modification allows us to maintain our 2024 retirement schedule, while reflecting important input from our customers and communities. Further, earlier this year we acquired the NCEMPA asset, a project that is a win-win for our customers in the Eastern region of North Carolina.","Our two gas pipeline infrastructure project Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail will provide critical access to additional low cost natural gas in the Southeast, helping to meet growing demand for the fuel from our generation portfolio, as well as to serve our customers\u2019 needs. These projects continue to move through the regulatory approval and siting processes. The formal FERC application for ACT was filed in September and we expect FERC approval in 2016. Once FERC approval is obtained, the project can begin construction activities with an expected COD in late 2018. At Sabal Trial FERC approval is expected in early 2015 with the pipeline operational in 2017. In Indiana, we are revising our grid modernization plan under state legislation and we plan to re-file our plan by the end of this year.","We\u2019re also making meaningful progress growing our renewable investments both in our regulated footprint and in the commercial business. On the regulated side, we\u2019re on track to complete construction of 128 megawatts of utility scaled solar in North Carolina by the end of this year and our moving forward with investments in both South Carolina and Florida. Our commercial renewables portfolio also continues to grow with demand for wind and solar projects throughout the U.S. is supported by renewable portfolio standards and growing customer demand. We have a number of commercial wind and solar projects slated to come online later this year, which will increase this portfolio to over 2,700 megawatts of capacity.","Overall, these growth investments total $20 billion through 2019 and provide the foundation for growth in the coming years. Steve will provide additional perspective on 2016 and beyond in his remarks. In conclusion, we continue to execute very well, providing safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers. Our growth prospects remain strong as we deploy significant capital and critical energy infrastructure investments. This establishes the foundation to provide clean modern energy to our customers and our communities for decades to come.","Let me turn it over to Steve.","Steve Young","Thanks Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll review our third quarter financial results and provide a brief look into 2016. I would also discuss the economic drivers in our regulated service territories and the low growth experienced in the third quarter. I\u2019ll ramp up with the discussion of our financial objectives.","Let\u2019s start with the quarterly results as highlighted on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompanied today\u2019s press release. We achieved third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, compared to $1.40 in last year\u2019s third quarter. On a reported basis, 2015 third quarter earnings per share were $1.35, compared to $1.80 last year. As a reminder last year\u2019s third quarter results included a $0.43 favorable adjustment for a change in the estimated value of the Mid-West generation business. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials to today\u2019s presentation.","Regulated utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.07 per share, driven largely by warmer weather and strong margins in our wholesale business, including the new NCEMPA contract. As we expected, these positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M related to the timing of outages, increased cost related to NCEMPA and higher storm costs.","International\u2019s quarterly earnings declined $0.02 over last year. Continued weakness in foreign exchange rates in Brazil and lower margins at National Methanol were partially offset by lower purchase power costs in Brazil. Additionally, we recognized an asset impairment in Ecuador during the quarter. Our commercial portfolio incurred $0.08 of lower adjusted earnings as a result of the absence of prior year Mid-West generation results due to lower wind resources this year earnings from our commercial renewable business are expected to be around 75 million for the full year versus our original expectation of 100 million.","Commercial\u2019s results will be favorable impacted in the fourth quarter by tax credits related to over 300 megawatts of wind in solar generation scheduled to come online. And finally other was up $0.06 due to favorable tax adjustments in the timing of tax levelization as a reminder due to income tax levelization other reflects projected benefits related to renewable tax credits ratably during the year. Once the projects become operational these benefits are reallocated to the commercial portfolio. Lastly our quarterly results benefited $0.04 from the accelerated stock repurchase completed earlier in the year.","Moving on to Slide 8, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. Across our jurisdictions weather-normalized retail load growth has increased by 0.3%, over the rolling 12 months. Within the residential sector we are seeing some positive trends. We continue to add new customers at an annual rate of approximately 1.3%. And we\u2019ve now experienced two consecutive quarters of relatively flat usage per customer. We also continue to see favorable key indicators for the residential sector including employment, personal incomes and spending, as well as household formations. The commercial sector continues to grow modestly benefiting from declining office vacancy rates and expansion in the restaurant and real estate sub-sectors. This growth was partially offset by lower governmental and retail store sales during the quarter.","The industrial sector while strong for most of the year has recently slowed, we are continuing to see transportation and building materials gain momentum. In particular, residential construction activities remain strong in the Southeast. During the quarter, we began to experience some weakness in the metals and chemicals subsectors. This slowdown is due to a pause in industrial activity, driven by a deceleration of consumer, business and government spending, a reduction in inventories and the strong dollar which has reduced global demand for U.S. products.","Our economic development teams remain active successfully helping to track new business investments into our service territories. So far this year these activities have led to the announcement of $2.4 billion in capital investments, which is expected to result in nearly 7,200 new jobs across our six states. With rolling 12 month weather-normalized load growth of 0.3% we expect to thin towards the low-end of our original 2015 expectation of 0.5% to 1%.","Moving to Slide 9, let me layout our key earnings drivers, as we begin thinking about 2016. As has been our normal practice we will provide our 2016 guidance range and updated financial plans in February. For our regulated businesses, we plan for normal weather. We expect growth from rider recovery and AFUDC on major capital investments, along with a full year impact of the NCEMPA transaction and modest growth in retail load.","With respect to our cost structure, we continue to build upon the success of our recent merger integration activities. Cost management is an ongoing effort. And we are finding ways to reduce O&M below current levels to match modest sales growth. We expect growth in the commercial portfolio, as we continue to add contracted renewable generation and expect the return of normal wind patterns. The loss of Midwest generation\u2019s earnings contribution is a headwind but it is partially offset by the accelerated soft repurchase.","We expect internationals\u2019 earnings have stabilized in 2015 and have the opportunity for modest growth in 2016, largely driven by an expectation for improved high growth dispatch, over the past several months we begun to see higher water inflows and lower market power crises. Further, meteorologists are forecasting a strong Alminio weather pattern through early 2016, which could lead to increased rainfall in Southeastern Brazil. Currency exchange rates are expected to remain volatile but the inflationary provisions in our contracts in Brazil can help to mitigate some of the currency devaluation. We also expect Brent crude oil prices will stabilize in 2016.","Now moving to Slide 10, I want to step back and discuss our overall earnings growth objectives. Since 2013, our regulated and commercial segments representing 90% of Duke Energy have delivered 5% earnings growth. As we look at 2016 and beyond. These segments are expected to continue to grow within our 4% to 6% growth objective as we deploy significant capital and critical gas and electric infrastructure investments, including the acquisition of Piedmont, as well as renewable investments in our commercial business.","We will also see the potential for rate cases in the Carolinas in the coming years to provide timely cash recovery of these important investments. The remaining portion of the company, the international business has experienced a decline, contributing earnings of $0.67 per share in 2013 and 2014 to about half that in 2015. About half of this decline is due to the three year drought in Brazil while unfavorable exchange rates and lower crude oil prices comprise the remaining half. From this point forward we will believe that internationals\u2019 earnings have stabilized and are positioned for modest growth, consistent with our past practice, we will provide more specific financial guidance in February. We plan to reset our base to 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth off of 2016. This reflects continued strong growth in our core businesses, as well as a more realistic based year for growth in our international business from 2016 forward.","Moving on Slide 11 outlines our financial objectives for 2015 and beyond. For the reasons Lynn mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our guidance range for 2015, from $4.55 to $4.75 per share to $4.55 to $4.65 per share. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic growth initiatives, both in our regulated and commercial businesses providing strong support for our long-term earnings growth objective. Our objective is to grow the dividend annually at a rate consistent with our long-term\u2019s earnings growth objectives. In near-term, our payout ratio will trend slightly above 70%.","We are comfortable with that higher range based on the strong growth in our core regulated and commercial businesses. And the cash flows we are repatriating from international. Our strong investment grade credit ratings are important to us, as they help us finance our growth in an efficient manner. I am pleased with our results for 2015. We have successfully executed on a number of key strategic initiatives and delivered strong financial and operating results. Helping to offset the weakness in international, we remain focused on finishing the year well.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","So this morning, you reiterated your 4% to 6% growth, but also higher yet to be determined 2016 base year and you did drop that footnote you had in the second quarter around DEI potentially being a swing factor in your outlook. Steve is this sort of like what you meant when you mentioned that Piedmont deal would enhance growth trajectory is it less concerns around DEI or sort of what\u2019s driving this increased confidence?","Steve Young","Well, I think what I would refer you to Shar is the slide we discussed 10. Where we looked at our core businesses, when you isolate international with our core businesses they have grown consistently at 5% from 2013 through \u201915 and we would expect that to continue. The international business has involved which moved from a $0.60 per year business to $0.30. And that\u2019s been the challenge we\u2019ve had to deal with in 2015, that\u2019s difficult to overcome. So we billion rebasing in \u201916 makes sense in light of what international has done.","Shar Pourreza","And it included Piedmont right?","Lynn Good","We expect to close Piedmont Shar towards the end of \u201916 into \u201917, you may recall from our announcement a week ago that we laid out a calendar. We will work as aggressively as we can to close it but I think a year is a good planning assumption.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it. And then just one last question on international, it\u2019s good to see the currencies becoming a little bit less of an issue the hydrology is improving. We haven\u2019t heard much on this lately. Is there any sort of incremental datapoints around the Brazilian government potentially looking at providing some sort of a retrieve to the hydro generators or is this sort of a kind of a dead movement?","Steve Young","There has been a lot of activity in this area Shar, recently there was a technical note that was issued by an arm of the government and that\u2019s really just a document that summarizes discussions to-date, a number of discussions are occurring. The government is targeting issuing effectively an executive order this calendar it remains uncertain exactly when, but that\u2019s their target. And what that order might say is not certain at this point either. So there is more work to be done here. I would say that in general the views of people and the government and the regulators have been constructive with regard to generators in our position. So there is more to come there in the meantime, the injunctions are still in effect and that has provided some relief to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hi just taking up on the Slide 11, when you guys, you made the comment about the dividend trending higher than target payout ratio, but also you are wanting to keep with the long-term EPS growth rate. Can you just maybe translate what you\u2019re trying to signal in those comments which seem to be a little bit in conflict?","Lynn Good","Dan, I would go back to the Steve\u2019s comments on Slide 10 with the intent to rebase off of 2016 and move to 4% to 6% from that point forward. We see the dividend trending slightly above 70% in the very near-term. And so if I look at the strength of the dividend, the dividend is really driven by the underlying core business, which is growing quite well and given the investments we have put in place, we believe that it will continue. And so we have confidence in growing it at that rate and allowing payout ratio trend out modestly in the short-term we think it\u2019s a smart decision.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And then on O&Ms you guys have done a good job as far as bringing down costs since the Progress acquisition. What kind of reductions do you see from here as you are a part of that \u201916 drivers the idea of bringing cost out, is it a substantial reduction \u201916 versus \u201915 or is more just absorbing inflation at this point?","Lynn Good","We are still at work Dan on our plans and we\u2019re targeting to absorb inflation plus and we think that's going to be a combination of a number of things that we build a strong foundation on but we are going after productivity and efficiency and the company as you said has demonstrated a great ability to control cost and we see even more potential in to \u201916.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And then I guess maybe the last one just on you kind of just calibrated the commercial business and not to get too far ahead on \u201916 but commercial is now coming in below where you guys thought the normal baseline would be, do you still feel comfortable with $100 million as your run rate from residual commercial?","Lynn Good","This year we\u2019ve been impacted by wind resources Dan and I think that's a theme that you have seen with others that have significant renewable exposure. So we expect our restoration of that to more normal levels as part of our planning for \u201916 and then we do intend to continue to deploy capital in a way that meets our return expectations, so we would expect to see some growth. I think over the long-term the cash spreads and other things will have to be evaluated, but we see ongoing momentum around renewables.","Steve Young","And we have committed projects for 2016 lined up as well to keep the growth going there and also in our commercial portfolio as you move forward we will start to see earnings from our pipeline investments kick in as well.","Dan Eggers","Okay. So just one last one on the load growth trends, you may have had a -- you are below, at the bottom end or a little bit below where you thought you\u2019d be even the customer growth seemed pretty good this year, are you having to reconsider kind of what that long-term growth rate is, is it 0% to 0.5% or do you think there is some discrete usage trends maybe around multi-family housing or something like that that is explaining why usage has been that much of a drag relative to customer growth?","Lynn Good","Dan, I think we\u2019ve been working with a 0.5% to 1% for some time and I think a 0.5% seems to be the range that we\u2019re in. And I think it\u2019s all the things you talked about it is synergy efficiency, it is housing patterns and even volatility in industrial. We had strong industrial growth when you dial back in this quarter. So what we are focused on as we kind of link this discussion to our cost structure, is planning to cost structure that can absorb that variability and also be positioned for modest very low load growth if that's the direction things continue to head.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","I just would like to understand a little better when you are talking about this rebase on 2016 and Steve, I\u2019m not quite sure whether I have you right, are you saying you anticipate growing at the 4% to 6% through 2016 and then also off of 2016 or implicit within this concept to the rebase seems to be the idea that maybe you weren\u2019t or you want to reposition the range a little bit, I just want to understand what you are saying on \u201916, when you made that statement?","Steve Young","What we are looking at Jonathan is we will set a base year or anchor year off of 2016 and then you would see 4% to 6% growth from there. And we think we\u2019ve got to do that given the changes in international we think it\u2019s stabilized and it\u2019s moved from again a $0.60 business to a $0.30ish business going forward. So where we base with \u201916 as the anchor we see a 4% to 6% growth there, underlined by the strong core business growth in the track history that it shows and some potential modest growth in international from that new lower level.","Lynn Good","And so what I would add to that Jonathan, if you could look at the Slide 10, you see the regulated and commercial portfolio, the blue bar that's the bar that's growing at 4% to 6% and then you have an international business, which is about $0.30 in \u201915 so it would add to that and grow modestly. So that's the direction that we are trying to provide here with expectations for \u201916 and then we think from that base, we are in a position to grow at 4% to 6% going forward.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Understood. Thank you. Could you maybe just -- do you have an expectation currently on what -- how pension will look as a driver for next year just specifically or is it a little early to tell?","Steve Young","It's a little early to tell on pension you got to take a look at the discount rate right at year-end, and who knows where that will go, if the Fed raises rates or something that could have an impact on it, I don't think it would be any huge change that we\u2019re looking at in pension expense, at this point but again with it being so sensitive to the discount rate, we would -- it's a little early to say precisely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","So a couple of questions, I just, these international pressures are not new and in the past you talked about trying to work on a plan and things to offset the international pressures. It just sounds to me like, it just not -- you just kind of changed to, they just are what they are, we\u2019re just resetting the base and then growing off there, because these are just -- became too much. Is that fair to say what happened?","Lynn Good","Steve I would say slightly differently. And in 2015, I think the team has done an extraordinary job of offsetting. What is happened in international, we started the year with an expectation, they would deliver 345 and they\u2019re delivering just north of 200 million. And that\u2019s an execution on strategic initiatives more timely and that\u2019s been running the business slow and taking advantage of good weather and other things that have developed. As we look forward, we did not have an expectation earlier in the year of weather international with rebound, the depth of the currency issues, were difficult to forecast at that time, the economic implications. And so as we sit here, closing the year we see a rebound on water conditions in hydrology, but we continue to see headwinds on currency and economic growth. And so we think it\u2019s appropriate in light of what we see today to establish a baseline of about $0.30 for \u201915 on international. And then we do believe it\u2019s stabilized and we see an opportunity for modest growth from there. I think what is important is that the 90% of the business regulated in core has demonstrated strong growth over the period of \u201913 to \u201915 and we think that will keep going. As a result of all the investments we have put in place and our ability to execute.","Steve Fleishman","And the updated guidance for the international you are now -- are you using kind of current forwards for currency in oil and the like or?","Lynn Good","Yes.","Steve Young","Yes.","Steve Fleishman","And essentially are you -- okay, great. And then just thinking about Piedmont and the context for the 4% to 6% of this 2016 base now just would that -- you talked on the deal announcement of that enhancing the 4% to 6% so if there was no Piedmont, would you still be 4% to 6% or not. Could you just kind of clarify now that you have this new base?","Lynn Good","Yes. So the growth rate is not dependent on Piedmont. We believe the base business itself, the investments that we\u2019ve outlined, the way the business is executing is capable of growing 4 to 6. So we see Piedmont as incremental to the growth rate. And\u2026","Steve Fleishman","But still in the 4 to 6?","Lynn Good","Yes.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just on the dividend growth and earnings growth comment. Because you\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to grow the dividend in line with earnings but then we\u2019re above the payout ratio. So kind of by definition you just switch to end up saying about the payout ratio. If that is what you actually do? So could you just kind of clarify your communication there?","Steve Young","Our dividend is growing about 4% now. I believe that we\u2019ll move above the 70% target level for a while. But as we grow we believe we\u2019ll return back to our target level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs & Company.","Michael Lapides","Real quick question, just when you think about the renewable business. You have had the earnings benefit in the last year or so. Can you quantify and Steve you touched on it, I want to make sure I understand it. Can you quantify the total EPS benefit of the tax credits? And then how you think about replacing that if solar development slows post 2016 and tax credit roll off or PTCs don\u2019t actually get extended?","Steve Young","Michael right now, a lot of the net income bottom-line benefit from the renewables, the commercial renewables business comes from the tax benefits. There is some profitability on the non-tax side in the ongoing margin, but the bulk of the earnings comes from the tax benefits. So your question is when these tax benefits when and if they expire what happens there. I think based on what we have seen and heard now there will still be a market for renewable power as no states are backing off RPF standards and that\u2019s a basis for a lot of the growth here is responding to RFPs to meet these requirements. The PPAs in the contracts may have to change with the absence of the tax benefits. And the pricing may have to change, but we will still structure this business to provide profitability here. I would also add that the cost for the renewables is going down and will help offset some of the tax benefits that exists.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And just how much were for those tax benefits as part of your 2015 guidance. Is that the full piece of commercial that $75 million or just some portion of it?","Steve Young","It\u2019s the majority of the 75 million.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. The other thing can the O&M cost savings offset the $0.17 impact of positive weather this year?","Lynn Good","Michael, we are not getting that specific on how each of these drivers impact, so what I would direct you to is think about our O&M spend and we are at work to not only offset inflationary impact to drive those costs lower in \u201916. So I think about weather and we always start by planning normal weather and then we\u2019re building up with investment earnings as well as cost control.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Chen of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Chen","Hi my questions have been answered guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jim Von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities.","Jim Von Riesemann","I got to put my dead head on for a second here. Can you just a talk little bit about how much cash flow is upstream from the regulated utilities to the parent level every year on an annualized basis?","Lynn Good","I think we will probably take that question offline. Jim, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve got a cash flow statement sitting in front of us here.","Steve Young","Right, I don't have that with me, we\u2019ll have to work on that a bit Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ali Agha.","Ali Agha","Lynn and Steve just listening to your comments, just so that I\u2019m clear, with normalized weather next year international being modest, some cost savings and then the rebasing, just directionally it appears that \u201916 it is pretty much flat to maybe modestly down from \u201915 and then so is that fair?","Lynn Good","I think we\u2019ve given you the drivers, if you look at the slide, on Slide 10 to grow the base business at 4% to 6% add to it international with modest growth and so I think we\u2019ve given you a pretty good sense of where we think it will be and of course we\u2019ll give you more detail in February, as we finalize our business plans so that you can understand more specifically how much of it is coming from O&M and how much is coming from each of the business segments.","Ali Agha","Okay. And more near-term in 2015, when you locked of $0.10 from the higher end of the range, is that all because of commercial, is it international being worse, can you just kind of elaborate the change in \u201915 guidance?","Lynn Good","So Ali, we have really been working throughout \u201915 to offset weakness in international and have been successful in doing that through a variety of things including favorable weather, as well as early closings on the Eastern Power Agency and the stock buyback. As we look to the fourth quarter though we always plan for normal weather, we started out with October being mild, we have storm expense sitting in October, we have a slighter, weaker currency as a result of some of the movements that occurred in September and then we also talked about the extension of bonus depreciation. We don't know for sure, but it feels to us like that will likely get extended and if it does, because of our cash position, it results in a modestly higher effective tax rate for the company. So all of those things considered, we think $4.55 to $4.65 is an appropriate range at this point.","Ali Agha","Steve and on the bonus depreciation front Lynn, I mean the talk is that if it gets extended, it\u2019s a two year extension, I\u2019m just curious of that's how you guys are seeing it and if so can you just quantify, just a bonus depreciation and extension impact for Duke?","Steve Young","We\u2019ve heard various guesses that how long it will be extended, we think there is a good likelihood of at least one year, two years is possible as well, and the impacts for 2015, for one year extension is in the range of $0.04 for us if you go beyond into a two year extension, it could be a similar number just depends on our overall tax positioning the issue for us is we\u2019re toggling in and out of an NOL position and which makes us perhaps unique in the industry, if you are deeply within an NOL or outside of an NOL position. This extension doesn\u2019t have an impact and it depends a bit on when we come out of that NOL position, which depends on other factors. So it's a little hard to predict beyond \u201915.","Lynn Good","And of course all the cash flow. Cash flow is positively impacted, if it is extended, so let see if this is giving you as earnings for certain.","Ali Agha","Absolutely. Last question Lynn, so on the international operations is the mind set now look, sort of hunker down and sort of work with the portfolio flat to modest growth, is that sort of the planning now and not really being more proactive and saying, hey does this really fit in the portfolio?","Lynn Good","Our focus has certainly been this year, Ali trying to run the business as efficiently as we can, we focused on cost, I think the international team has done an extraordinary job in a difficult market, we think it stabilized and hopefully, we\u2019ll see a slightly better picture in \u201916. I think the portfolio is always under review. The fact that we added Piedmont is consistent with our view that we wanted more natural gas in the portfolio. So that\u2019s an ongoing review, in the meantime we\u2019re also taking advantage of the international cash as you know.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Paul Ridzon","In your release you indicate that for the quarter weather was a $0.09 pick-up at the utility and then when I look at Slide 19 in the deck. I see that last year it was $0.06 below norm, but this year is basically short of normal. Just trying to reconcile that?","Steve Young","Yes. I think that your statements are correct there is some rounding in some of these schedules I believe is the difference in your sense. But we\u2019ve returned to normal weather this quarter last year, it was mild weather.","Lynn Good","And Paul the other thing I would know the share count is going to have a difference between \u201914 and \u201915, because of the share buyback.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. And then kind of given the pending Piedmont acquisition, what\u2019s going to happen to proceeds from securitization, should that just sit on the balance sheet when you use that cash when you close the deal?","Lynn Good","Yes. So we would expect securitization to move through the process in \u201916 Paul. So we don\u2019t come into the cash flow as a company and be used for investments or 4 billion debt in the short-term. But we do see at as the cash flow item that over a long-term basis could be used for long-term investments Piedmont being one of them.","Paul Ridzon","When do you expect that cash?","Steve Young","We would expect to be able to close the securitization in the first to second quarter of 2016.","Paul Ridzon","And then just lastly your latest thoughts around filing rate cases in your regulatory jurisdictions?","Steve Young","We\u2019re looking at filing in I would say in the late teens it depends upon investment plans and other factors there that we\u2019d look at jurisdiction by jurisdiction. But generally we\u2019re looking at rate cases in the Carolinas in the late teens.","Paul Ridzon","And then lastly just a clarification on the payout ratio discussion, if you were to look at your \u201915 payout ratio what would you use as the numerator and denominator. I guess 460 would be denominator?","Steve Young","I\u2019m sorry, ask that again, I\u2019m sorry I am not.","[Multiple Speakers]","Paul Ridzon","I just want to make sure, how are you thinking about the payout ratio? What -- is it the indicated dividend at year-end or is it the dividend paid during the year?","Steve Young","It\u2019s the dividend paid during the year as it grows over the annual earnings.","Paul Ridzon","So it\u2019s kind of a mix a blend of two years of dividends, because change at mid-year?","Lynn Good","So there is nothing fancy about this Paul. Whether you use an annualized number or whether you use what is paid out I think it\u2019s all a matter of small rounding. I would calculate the payout ratio the way you typically do for every other utility.","Operator","Thank you. There appear to be no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for any closing or final remarks.","Lynn Good","So thank you everyone for joining us today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Our fourth quarter earnings call which will also include our updated financial forecast will be held in February and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months and at the EEI Conference next week.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on recent activities, including our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also discuss our growth drivers for 2019 before closing with key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","Let me begin on slide 4. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 compared to $1.59 in the prior year. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, supported by the outstanding work of our employees, who restored outages and back-to-back hurricanes over the last two months.","As we look to the end of the year, we have narrowed our full year guidance to $4.65 to $4.85 per share, raising the midpoint and to the upper half of our original range. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2022, also midpoint of our 2017 guidance range. We continue to expect earnings growth at the low end of this range in 2019 and the mid to high end of the range in 2020 and beyond.","In addition to strong financial results, we're pleased to highlight several recent recognitions for the company. Let me emphasize too that I know are important to our ESG investors. Duke Energy was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th consecutive year, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility. And Forbes named Duke Energy to their Global Best Employers list, which is based on rankings of publicly traded companies from 60 countries around the world. We're proud that our company and employees are being recognized for the work we do every day on behalf of our customers and communities.","Turning to slide 5, I want to give you an update on our response to hurricanes Florence and Michael and in a moment Steve will share our thoughts on cost estimates and recovery. First, Hurricane Florence, this was a massive slow-moving storm that made landfall on the North Carolina coast in early September, causing widespread devastation and record setting rainfall. Ahead of the storm, we assembled our largest restoration force ever in the Carolinas, over 20,000 workers, to prepare and immediately begin restoring power when it was safe to do so.","In addition, 2,000 employees outside of transmission and distribution volunteered to support our efforts from managing logistics to providing extra help, answering customer calls. We restored over 1.8 million outages in less than 10 days, with 93% restored in five days. Despite extensive flooding, the environment around our facilities, including ash basins remained well protected. This is a testament to our team's extensive preparation in advance of the storm and on the ground management throughout the heavy rainfall.","Only weeks later, Hurricane Michael made landfall in early October on the Florida Panhandle. Michael triggered over 70,000 power outages in our Florida service territory before moving north and causing over 1.1 million outages in the Carolinas. More than 15,000 workers contributed to the restoration efforts with 90% of the outages restored within three days. All customers who could receive power were restored in five days in the Carolinas and eight days in Florida, but work continues in Florida as we rebuild our infrastructure in the most devastated areas.","Our successful storm response was driven in part by lessons learned from previous storms and our investments to improve the grid. For example, in our DEP service territory, self-healing grid technologies rerouted power from damaged lines to minimize outages. We estimate that we avoided 27 million outage minutes across the Carolinas from the use of this technology during Hurricane Florence. Our grid improvement plan includes expansion of this technology to 80% of our customers over the next decade, up from 16% currently.","And in Florida, we made improvements on a transmission line at St. George Island a few years ago. This area was in the direct path of the hurricane and the structures withstood hurricane force winds. During this hurricane season, we restored 3 million outages, thanks to the tireless work of our employees and utility partners. And I'm truly proud of this team.","The benefits of modernizing and hardening the grid were clear during the hurricanes and we continue to invest in the energy grid on behalf of our customers. We've highlighted several developments across our jurisdictions on slide 6.","In South Carolina, the Commission approved deferral accounting treatment for our grid improvement investments such as smart meters, self-optimizing grid technology and additional hardening and resiliency mechanisms. Our grid improvement plan is a key part of our strategy to meet customer expectations. These investments will deliver increased reliability, enable distributed resources and provide enhanced customer convenience and control.","In the Carolinas, we recently announced approximately $500 million in battery storage investments over the next 15 years, as described in our Integrated Resource Plan filed this past September. This investment, equal to about 300 megawatts of capacity, will provide our Carolinas utilities with another tool to balance the energy system.","In Florida, consistent with our multiyear agreement, we announced an electric vehicle pilot program that will install up to 530 EV charging stations throughout our service territory in 2019. These stations will be connected in multi-unit dwellings, workplaces and other areas with broad public access.","Similarly, we have proposed an electric transportation pilot in South Carolina, which includes charging station programs throughout residential areas as well as school and transit bus systems. We look forward to rolling out similar programs in our other jurisdictions to promote greater use of electric vehicles for our customers.","Moving to slide 7, let me provide an update on some of our other strategic investments. We are nearing completion of our 1,600-megawatt Citrus County natural gas combined-cycle plant in Florida. The first unit came online in October. We have successfully achieved initial firing of Unit 2, which is on track to start serving customers in December.","Recall that the Florida Commission approved our requested $200 million revenue increase for the plant under the GBRA mechanism. Increases to customer rates for Unit 1 will begin in December and rates associated with Unit 2 are expected to be implemented in January.","Construction continues at our natural gas combined-cycle plant in Asheville as part of our Western Carolinas modernization project. The plant is 50% complete and remains on track for the expected late 2019 in-service date.","In July, we launched the first request for proposal for new renewable energy resources in North Carolina under House Bill 589. This 680-megawatt solicitation seeks projects that can be placed in service by the end of 2020. Bids were submitted October 9, including those from our North Carolina utilities and Commercial Renewables business.","Over the next several months, the independent administrator will review the bids and winning proposals are expected to be notified in the first quarter of 2019. New project construction is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2019 to meet the 2020 in-service dates.","In Commercial Renewables, we've started a process to find a minority partner in our existing 3,000-megawatt wind and solar portfolio as we seek to recycle and reinvest capital from these assets. We will continue to be the majority owner and operator of the portfolio and intend to retain nearly all of the tax benefits associated with the projects. It is still early in the process, but we are seeing strong interest.","Looking ahead to 2019, we have approximately 300 megawatts of wind and solar in late stages of development. And we will use tax equity to finance these projects.","Turning to our gas business on slide 8, let me provide an update on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We're working diligently to complete the project to bring low-cost gas supply and economic development opportunities to the region. Mainline construction continues in West Virginia and North Carolina. And we're making progress on constructing the compressor and metering and regulation stations in those states. The tree-felling window reopened in September and we continue with felling activities where permitted in all three states along the pipeline route.","The Virginia DEQ approved our erosion and sediment control plan on October 19, making the water quality certificate effective for that state. We've requested permission from FERC to begin full construction activities in Virginia and expect the approvals soon. This was the last major permit remaining for the pipeline, marking a significant milestone for the project. Throughout this process, the relevant permitting agencies have conducted extensive due diligence, ensuring the project will meet all necessary environmental rules and regulations. We appreciate the professionalism exhibited by these agencies as they worked with our project team to complete these reviews.","Given permitting delays and the FERC's stop work order in August, the project partners have reexamined the construction schedule and cost estimates. We will now pursue with our customers putting the pipeline in service in phases with the late 2019 in-service for all station facilities and key portions of the pipeline in order to meet peak winter demand. We're also pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments.","Based on these changes, we now estimate cost in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, an increase of $500 million over the previous range. Future factors such as abnormal weather, work delays due to judicial or regulatory action and other circumstances may result in additional costs or schedule changes.","In summary, our year-to-date results show that our company is performing well. We will continue executing on our strategy, investing in infrastructure our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors. As we look to close out the year, our achievements once again reinforce our belief that Duke Energy is the leading energy infrastructure company.","And before I turn it over to Steve, I want to thank our employees once again for their remarkable work during Hurricanes Florence and Michael. They showed unwavering dedication to our customers.","Steve, let me turn it to you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. I'll start with quarterly results on slide 9, including our adjusted earnings per share variances for the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.","On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 third quarter earnings per share were $1.51 compared to $1.36 last year. Third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.65 compared to $1.59 in the prior year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings was primarily due to a charge resulting from annual goodwill testing in our Commercial Renewables business.","For the quarter, higher adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to higher retail electric sales volumes and income tax benefits, partially offset by higher storm restoration costs and share dilution. Within the segment, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were supported by a few factors including strong load growth and more favorable weather.","We also saw growth from higher rider revenues and contributions from the DEP and DEC North Carolina rate cases. Finally, the Electric segment benefited from lower income tax expense, including impacts of the Tax Act. These favorable drivers were partially offset by three items: higher depreciation and amortization expense from a growing rate base, a charge related to the Edwardsport settlement in Indiana, and higher O&M, largely due to Hurricane Florence restoration costs.","We estimate total O&M the cost for Hurricane Florence of approximately $450 million, with the majority of the cost at our DEP utility. We will request permission to defer approximately $370 million of incremental cost for recovery in the next DEP rate case. The remaining incremental cost impacted O&M expense in the quarter and exceeded the cost from Hurricane Irma in 2017, contributing to the year-over-year variance.","I'd also point out that our preliminary O&M cost estimate for Hurricane Michael is approximately $200 million. The cost from this storm which primarily impacted our DEC and DEF utilities will be recorded in the fourth quarter. As with Florence, we will also request to defer the majority of these costs for future recovery. We will be making the appropriate filings with the state commissions over the coming months.","Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat in the quarter. Growth from our midstream investments was offset by higher O&M. We expect our LDC businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter.","In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.03 for the quarter. The increase was primarily due to the Shoreham Solar project, which was placed in service in July. Finally, Other was down $0.04 for the quarter, largely due to a lower tax yield as a result of the Federal Tax Act and a favorable litigation settlement in the prior year. Higher tax optimization benefits partially offset these drivers.","We continue to expect our full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. As you know, we settled half of our March equity offering in June, which resulted in $0.03 of share dilution for the quarter. Our equity financing plan remains on track and we continue to expect to settle all outstanding equity forwards in the fourth quarter.","Our strong execution through the first three quarters gives us confidence in our full year projection. And as Lynn mentioned, we narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $4.65 to $4.85 per share, raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original guidance range for the year. This reflects our results to date, including favorable weather, partially offset by costs associated with the two hurricanes. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and we'll manage our O&M and other business drivers in a way that keeps us on track to deliver on our commitments.","Turning to slide 10, our retail volumes were very strong in the quarter. Let me take a moment to walk you through the trends we're seeing across our serviced areas. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load growth was 1%. Our residential class continues to drive the growth with an overall increase of 1.8% on a rolling 12-month basis. Strong customer growth continues across our service territories and was amplified this quarter by positive usage per customer in certain jurisdictions.","We will continue to monitor this trend, given we've seen this periodically over the course of the year. We also saw strength in the commercial class, with sales up 1.1% over the rolling 12 months. Ongoing data center expansion and strength in hospitality and leisure segments helped to offset weakness in retail stores driven by competition from online shopping.","Finally, sales in our industrial class continued to improve and we were pleased to see a 1.8% increase within this sector during the quarter, driven by robust manufacturing growth in several sectors such as metals, textiles and transportation. The Carolinas, in particular, saw strong industrial growth in the quarter. These retail volume trends, along with a healthy economy and growth in our jurisdictions, further support our long-term planning assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our Electric Utilities.","As we head into the close of the year, let me highlight on slide 11 some of the drivers for 2019. We expect to be back within our long-term earnings growth range in 2019, which represents 6% growth off of our original 2018 midpoint. I'll start with growth in the Electric Utilities segment. In the Carolinas, earnings will be supported by a full year's contribution from this year's North Carolina rate cases, upcoming rate activity in South Carolina, as well AFUDC on our Western Carolina's modernization project.","In Florida, as Lynn discussed, we are adding the Citrus County combined-cycle plant to customer rates in the next few months. We will also begin to recover our ongoing grid investments through the first rate increase under our multiyear rate plan. Finally, we expect to initiate rate recovery under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism once our first solar project is in operation this December.","In the Midwest, we will continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs in Indiana and Ohio.","In the Gas segment, earnings will grow based on the continued construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, coupled with continued integrity management investments and strong customer additions in our gas LDCs. The changes to the ACP schedule and cost estimate that Lynn described will not significantly impact earnings in 2019 and 2020 as the project will continue to accrue AFUDC and now on a higher cost base.","Additionally, we have a strong pipeline of projects in our Commercial Renewables business, including the late-stage wind and solar projects with 2019 in-service dates.","Finally, we expect further load growth consistent with our long-term planning assumption. And we are aggressively managing cost across our businesses, including using digital capabilities to drive efficiencies. As you can see, we have a substantial set of investment opportunities that will provide growth into next year and beyond as we continue to execute on our strategy.","I'll close with slide 12. Our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend, which currently yields approximately 4.5%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low-risk investments, this provides a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Duke Energy's scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute position the company as the leading energy infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. This is actually Claire for Julien here.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Claire. How are you?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Doing well. Thanks for taking my question. My first is just on ACP. What is your expectation on timing to fund that additional CapEx need and how will it be funded? And what are you anticipating the returns on ACP now are?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, Claire, I'll take returns first. We expect this return to be consistent with other regulated investments. And so we're comfortable with where we are on return. And I would think about the financing of ACP as being managed through the overall financing of the company and then we do intend to put project financing in place at the time the project goes in service.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. It doesn't really have much of a bearing on your FFO to debt metrics. Just confirming that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We're committed to our FFO to debt metrics, Claire. And I think we've shared these ranges with you in previous calls. The cost increase for ACP, our responsibility is about half of that amount. And we believe we have tools within our company to manage through that transition.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. And just turning over to renewables as well, at this point, what do you think \u2013 what would you estimate the market out there to be potential or expected proceeds? And how would your use of proceeds work?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Claire, we're very early in the process. What I will share is that there has been strong interest. We've been watching this market for some time and are very familiar with it. The use of proceeds, I think we're too early to talk specifically about that. We haven't earmarked proceeds for any specific purpose. And of course, we'll update you as the sale process continues and give you a closer look at a financing plan as we come to the Street in February.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Would it be fair to just view it as offsetting incremental debt issuances or any kind of other funding internally?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I wouldn't be that specific at this point, Claire. We've just launched the process. So we need to work through it in order to have a sense of where the market is, the proceeds, the timing and all of those things. So that's where we are at this point.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just one quick thing. It looks like \u2013 or if I look at trailing 12-month numbers, the midpoint of the new 2018 range would suggest a slightly down fourth quarter. Can you remind us what type of things would support that?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I think as we go into the fourth quarter, you're looking at milder weather and that impact there will pick up the gas distribution business. I don't think there's anything unusual that we're looking at in the fourth quarter. Some of the variations per quarter are hard to predict. Tax optimization efforts, as an example, that came through in the third quarter. In certain years, they have come through in a fourth quarter. So, I wouldn't look to anything negative that's occurring necessarily in the fourth quarter, Jonathan.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The only special thing I'd point to, Jonathan, is Michael is in the fourth quarter. The storm hit in October. So we'll be addressing Michael in the fourth quarter.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on industrial growth, you flagged last quarter that you expected some of the temporary effects to start working out of the numbers and looks like that happened. But what do you feel is your underlying industrial sales growth number?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I think the underlying industrial sales growth number will continue to improve as we move out and lap, if you will, some of the unique perturbations there. We saw very strong industrial growth for this particular quarter, as I mentioned, across the entire enterprise of 1.8%. I don't know that we're going to see that as an ongoing mechanism \u2013 ongoing number going forward. But we do see strength in our residential customers, a good bit of diversity across the enterprise. I don't have a full year number. I think the overall 0.5% is very solid, but that combines residential with it and commercial as well. So, no specific number yet on what I'd see industrial on a run rate, but it's improving on the 12-month carrying. And I think that'll continue for a few quarters.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. My question really, Steve, was, is the growth \u2013 the improvement, just the lapping of the outages, or is it actually underlying growth as well?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","I think we're seeing some underlying growth as well with it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, can you just remind us what is the sales growth assumption overall that underpins your comments on guidance and getting to the high end of 4% to 6% in 2020 plus?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Again, we're looking at 0.5% sales growth weather normal across our footprint and that's all customer classes. We continue to think that's a reasonable number to bake into our forecasting over our longer term plans.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, just to follow up on Jon's question. It looks like sales growth is actually continuing to improve and we've seen that for several quarters now and you're thinking that it might continue going forward. At what point do you think you might start considering increasing the projected growth that's embedded in guidance from 0.5% to something a little higher?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I think we'll continue to watch. We've been surprised to the upside, which is a good thing, but we believe a 0.5% assumption is good to really establish the parameters around our cost structure and the way we manage the business. For every positive piece of economic news, there's something on the horizon, whether it's tariffs or rising interest rates and other things. So, we're really comfortable with 0.5% now and hope to surprise to the upside.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And for hurricane costs, for Hurricane Michael and also Hurricane Florence, is there anything that's been going on? Those are being deferred right now. I mean, do you have a deferral order? Just remind me, sorry if I missed that earlier.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","We will make application for the official deferral order in the near-term. We are \u2013 in the third quarter, we incurred the costs associated with Hurricane Florence. And as I said, we've deferred $370 million of the O&M costs related to that and the deferrals based upon past history and practice. We'll make those official filings later this year.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","As you get ready for next year's rate cases in North Carolina and also for \u2013 talking to the state legislators about grid modernization, do you think that the \u2013 it seems to me like an increasing frequency of hurricanes in your territory and throughout the Southeast. Is that being factored into the discussions or has that improved the climate for grid modernization going forward?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I would say those storms have been a significant issue here in the Carolina. It's just the impact on the eastern part of the state. And there is a lot of interest to invest in infrastructure to support that region and to make smart investments to position the state for the future. So, I think hardening and resiliency is something that makes a lot of sense. And we're, of course, developing projects that we believe would support the infrastructure in the state. Taking lessons learned from these storms, but also looking at other areas of our grid that we think modernization could benefit customers.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Going back to the line of questioning from earlier, you're doing well this year, the midpoint of guidance is $4.75. And then, using a $4.60 base, and I'm looking at slide 11, are you saying you expect the compound annual growth rate to be 4% through 2019? And then, the compound annual growth rate, not the incremental growth rate, but the compound annual growth rate to look more like 5% or 5.5% as you get into 2022. I just want to make sure that I'm looking at that correctly. You're using a compounding function not a year-over-year function, correct?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's right. And so, Greg, what we're talking about is 4% compound number for 2019. And then by 2020, we believe we'll be up in that 5%, mid to high end of the range.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Right. And that's my point. That's my point. Because 5% compound from $4.60 in 2017 through 2020 would put you $0.10 above Street consensus, $5.33 a share, and would put you $0.15 above Street consensus in 2021. And the Street has been consistently, me included, to be frank with you, more cynical about your growth opportunities as it pertains to your guidance. And so what gives you the confidence that the compounding effect of the investments and the changes you're making in the business can get you there? And what do you think the dissidence is between Street expectations and your aspirations?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, Greg, I would say that the capital plan that we've put in front of the Street as well as the recovery mechanisms that go with that give us the confidence to deliver the results. And of course, cost management, load growth are also a part of that picture. And we believe we've been consistently demonstrating the ability to grow the company. This is the second full year of the portfolio that we now operate. Historically, we had some noise with international and other things. They're now two years in the rearview mirror. And my expectation is as we continue to execute, there will be greater confidence that we will deliver what we've set out.","And so we're proud of the fact that we're delivering what we set out in terms of commitments this year. We delivered last year. We have adjusted with tax reform in a way that has been constructive not only to investors but to the balance sheet.","And so, our assignment is to keep executing in a way that grows the company and maintains that balance sheet for the future and that is our focus.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And how necessary or important to the execution of your plan is, the grid modernization and capital plan rollout in North Carolina and getting recovery mechanisms either through legislative guidance to the Commission or from the Commission that are a more contemporaneous return framework?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, grid investment is an important part of the strategy, Greg. And certainly, North Carolina is important to the overall results of Duke Energy because of the scale of those utilities, both DEC and DEP. As we've shared with you, we believe we have parallel paths to pursue, a legislative path or increased frequency of regulatory filings in order to achieve our financial results.","We do believe, with the value proposition that grid investment represents, including the storm hardening that we just talked, that a recovery mechanism that is certain over a two to three year period with predictable investment and predictable impact to customers with value that goes with those predictable increases is a compelling business proposition and we'll continue to pursue, as I said, in both the legislative and regulatory process.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Lynn, thank you. Take care.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning, Stephen.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to go back to the ACP process. Given that the cost has gone up, I wondered if you could just talk through the regulatory process for potentially adjusting the required revenue upward or should we assume that it's relatively unlikely that revenue would be adjusted upward? I just wanted to circle back on that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Stephen, I think we are in discussions with customers in connection with this partial in-service trying to establish interim pricing. And our objective always is to find the right balance between meeting customer needs and delivering benefits and then returns to investors. We have reset price once and received approval of those prices. We believe this investment still represents the most cost-effective solution for our customers and we'll continue to be in dialogue with customers as we go forward. So, our focus right now is on partial in-service and establishing interim prices and we'll just continue to stay in touch with customers as the project continues.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then just further on system hardening, I think you've given us some good color as to how you're thinking about that, but I'm trying to get a better sense for the path to getting approval. So let's just say that you go through your assessment and you determine that an additional amount of capital is needed. Could you talk a little bit more to the different paths that we should be thinking about in terms of getting approval for that spending? Just it seems like obviously there probably are needs for significant additional hardening. How do we think about translating that into regulatory or legislative outcomes?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Stephen, I think it depends on the path that we take. I think in a legislative path, a stakeholder process will be important to have discussions around the type of investment, the timing, et cetera. You may recall, we reached a partial settlement with certain environmental stakeholders as part of the DEC case that set a term, a cap, pilots for targeted under grounding and then specific investments around batteries, EV, et cetera, self-optimizing technologies, et cetera. So, I think as you think about a multi-year rate plan or if you were to think about some other method to establish a multiyear investment program, there would be some degree of sharing those investments and agreement. We don't contemplate that it would necessarily be required pre-approval on individual projects because we're talking about a number of small things that accumulate over time, but we, of course, are early in the process of making those changes.","Under a pure regulatory path, you make the investments and demonstrate benefits and those become a part of your cost of service and you would think about those in a traditional way. Let me just close by saying, we are in discussion around these investments and the benefits they can deliver to customers, both with regulators and with stakeholders. And that process will continue. We think those investments are very important to the state and to our customer base. And so, those conversations will continue.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Lynn. So, just a question first on the quarter. I think in a couple of the business, as you mentioned, the impact of tax rate partially due to the tax law change. Could you maybe separate out tax law change versus other tax items just so we have an idea on that?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","What I might mention here on tax law changes is we had some fixed price contracts in our wholesale business, gas and electric, whereby the pricing doesn't change necessarily due to tax changes. So that brings some benefits in. And then, there's just tax optimization we're working through the various structures that we have in place across our footprint that'll provide some benefits. I don't have a breakout right now between those, but those are the two factors that lead to it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's fine. And then, I guess, just on the renewable for North Carolina. My recollection is those were not necessarily in your capital plan if you end up winning some of those, but I'm not sure if anything else has kind of changed in the plan going back to really this year. So just if we see you win a handful of projects there, should we think about that all being incremental or in the context of kind of the whole plan maybe some things haven't gone away?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I would think about it more within the context of the plan, Steve. We did have renewable capital in our plan in February. And actually, the way we approached it is we put all of the capital in the Commercial business, recognizing that it could either be in the utility or the commercial business depending on how we win, but we put the capital in the Commercial Renewables segment.","So, given the timeline of House Bill 589 and the fact we'll know more after the first of the year, we'll continue to update capital and share that with you in February. But I would think about it at this point as part of the overall capital plan that we shared with you.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So, maybe first touch on the storms. I know you're deferring some of the costs, but in terms of the cash flow, is there an ability to fund some of that cash with securitization? Or if there isn't, how do you fund or does it put any kind of pressure on the credit metrics or different funding gap, given the storm costs that you're facing right now?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, we are financing in the short-term with commercial paper, short-term financing methods, and we will convert to longer term at the right time. We'll be filing, as Steve indicated, for a deferral at the end of the year and would like to match long-term financing with the recovery mechanisms that are in place. We're always mindful of the impact to customers. And so, we have tools like excess deferred taxes that have not yet been fully dealt with in the Carolinas. Securitization, as you mentioned, is always a tool. So, our plans will continue to mature on this over the balance of this year into next.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And does Commercial Renewables and the sale of Commercial Renewables, will that fit neatly into it or does it happen to fit neatly into it or is there a plan to kind of use some of those proceeds for this?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We haven't earmarked proceeds from Commercial Renewables at this point, Praful. Early in the process, don't yet know what the value is going to be, timing, etcetera, but you can think about that as a tool, right, within the company at large, of an inflow of cash. So, we'll consider all of these things and really be in a position to give more feedback on specific financing plans in February.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And then, finally, just following up a little bit on Greg's question on long-term growth. Wanted to understand, you had mentioned earlier the impact of tariffs and other macro factors that could impact your growth as you think about it longer term. I guess to achieve your long-term target, what are the variables we should be thinking about or tracking on a more macro level that you think could impact your ability to execute on the 4% to 6%?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, those comments were within the context of why not raise 0.5%. So, we believe 0.5% is a very good planning assumption as we look at the profile of our business, where we're located geographically, the attractive nature of the service territories, et cetera. But large economic shocks, if we were to ever get to that point, would be something we'd need to check and adjust, but there's nothing unique to Duke Energy, as I talk about that.","So, as I think about long-term growth, 0.5% is load growth assumption. Aggressive cost management will continue to be a part of the equation. And then, the capital plan that we've put in front of you with rate increases or recovery mechanisms that are in place across our jurisdiction will be the other driver.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Awesome. Very helpful. Thank you, Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Shar.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. You touched on most of my questions, but let me just \u2013 can you just elaborate on House Bill 589 real quick and sort of what's embedded in your plan, because I thought prior communication really focused on having a very little \u2013 somewhat of a base assumption around what you could win? And I guess the way I'm trying to come up with this is there's 2.7 gigawatts potentially in this state that can be procured. There's 30% that you guys could essentially win, but there's no cap on how much you guys can acquire from developers that are likely looking to recycle their capital, right? So, if you kind of look at the opportunity set, it could reach well over $1 billion to $2 billion of opportunity. So, I guess my question is, how much of this is embedded in your plan? Is it sort of a very little base assumption? I'm just trying to figure out the scale here because I thought this was predominately incremental.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Shar, I appreciate that question. We did put an assumption in, but I think to use your terminology, it's going to be closer to a base assumption than it is to a we-buy-everything assumption. And as I have said a moment ago, we're beginning to \u2013 we're early in the process. The bids are in. The administrator will be reviewing bids. We'll begin to have some visibility to this process in the first quarter and that would be the time for us to update. We see the nature of the projects, we see the returns that are implied, and I think they represent great opportunities for us, but we'd be evaluating those returns against the other investment opportunities we have and making good decisions about it.","So, to close, I would say that the capital that's in there is more of a base assumption.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then just let me ask you, assuming that the ultimate outcome is better than your base assumption, do you see any need to put incremental equity as far as looking at additional opportunities around solar. So, i.e., if you do better than your base assumption, you acquire developers that are looking to recycle, is there any instance where you think you may need to raise equity as a result?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Shar, at this point, we're comfortable with the plans we've put in front of you on equity, the equity raise we did this year. Our ongoing assumptions around about $350 million of equity a year, we think that positions the company really well, strikes the right balance between balance sheet and growth. And so, I would think about that incremental capital as being evaluated as part of our total investment plan. And we'll continue, as I said, to provide updates on what we think the future holds. But right now, I'm comfortable with the equity plan we have in place and our ability to absorb upside on the renewables as we look at the total collection of capital that we're planning to spend as a company.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","And I'd add that the use of tax equity financing and back leverage and so forth helps on minimizing the investment on Commercial Renewables.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, Steven, and see you soon.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify the raise in the 2018 midpoint of $0.05, is that all primarily driven by better weather or was there something else in there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, I would say weather and volumes on the upside, really being offset by storm expense is the way I would look at it. So, we've had very strong weather in volumes, but we've also had the hurricanes to absorb.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I got you. Okay. And then secondly, next year when you all update your plans, et cetera, is there thought would you move your base year to 2018 to build out your growth rate targets, or what are you thinking about there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, we haven't made a decision around base year. We've been working off of 2017. As you know, we've continued to emphasize that, as outlined on slide 11. So, we'll make that evaluation as we go forward, but you should be comfortable that we're talking about a range that works off of the 2017 base.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And then also, in terms of the longer term growth outlook, just remind us again sort of embedded in your long term, 4% to 6% CAGR, how much reduction, if any, in regulatory lag is assumed in there, or is it all sort of CapEx rate based driven with earned ROEs relatively constant. Can you just remind us what the earned ROE trends?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","A couple of things I'd point at. We've got a long history of earning well on our regulated rate basis, in the 10%, 10.5% range. Through periods of having rate cases, not having rate cases, we've been able to utilize cost efficiencies, expansion of wholesale sales to \u2013 and rate cases to make that happen through various differing circumstances. There certainly is an element of lag as you build your investment base between rate cases. That's natural to occur. It'll vary depending up on the regulatory mechanisms in place and the timeframes between rate cases. But we're working to reconstruct the regulatory recovery mechanisms and minimize lag as much as possible.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, just to be clear, that ramp-up \u2013 the implied ramp-up in growth from 2020 onwards, that's all being driven by the \u2013 the way you're looking at your CapEx profile, you're not assuming a pickup in earned ROE helping you 2020 and beyond?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, it's looking at the investment base growing and our ability to convert that into revenues through the regulatory processes, in addition to organic load growth and renewables business, all of that combined. But on the regulated side, it's the investments and the ability to efficiently incorporate that into revenues at typical allowed types of returns, as we have demonstrated at our ability to do for many years.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Lynn. I have an easy one. You filed in South Carolina, can you talk to us a little bit about just your main request in South Carolina and whether you're actually trying to seek any kind of more structural change in rate making there or is it just kind of a traditional rate case? And then, B, how should we think about where you're likely \u2013 the cadence of rate case filings between now and maybe the end of 2019 in terms of where you're likely to file?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I would think about the South Carolina cases as mirroring, in many ways, what we tried to accomplish in North Carolina. So, the same drivers and approach, trying to focus on grid investment, but also receiving recovery of historic investments, it'll be the same approach in South Carolina. We did point out on this call that we were successful in achieving a deferral of the grid investment, which we view as a positive step in South Carolina.","And then in terms of other rate cases, Florida will automatically reset with the Citrus, the solar and the grid investment. Midwest also will continue to reset, but you can expect us to file cases next year. Piedmont potentially, Indiana potentially, and then with the in service date of Western Carolinas, that's a good date to watch for the Duke Energy progress case.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And I guess last one, how do you think about the cadence of O&M in 2018 relative to what you originally expected? And I'm trying to think about it excluding storm impact. And then, the opportunity set for being able to manage it down further in 2019.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","In 2018, we're tracking to be right at our target for O&M, exclusive of the storm costs. And again, our broad target for O&M is to keep it flat throughout our planning horizon. And I think we have the capabilities to do that, hopefully do better than that, as we advance capabilities and data analytics and rolling out digital technology capabilities across our footprint with our scope and scale, I think we have great abilities to control O&M.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn. See you...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...out in California.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's question and answer session. Now, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for additional and closing remarks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Great. Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Callahan","Thank you, Rachael. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2016 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on Slide 3, Lynn will cover the key milestones we reached in the quarter as we near the completion of our portfolio transition and provide a brief overview of our new business segments. She will also discuss our third quarter financial and operational highlights and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results, and lower growth trends as well as an update on regulatory activity. He will also provide insight into our expectations for 2017 before closing before closing with our key investor considerations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good ","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We have a strong third quarter at Duke Energy. Delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition and we also announce the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high quality stable and growing energy infrastructure businesses. ","Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3rd, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We\u2019re delighted to bring Piedmont's industry leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform. Supporting our transition to a lower carbon future and growing investments and important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway.","In addition on October 10th, we announced agreements with the China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we\u2019ve received required approvals in Brazil and China. We\u2019re making good progress. ","In fact to this morning the Brazilian anti-trust agency preliminarily approved the transactions without any restrictions. This begins a 15 day statutory objection period and if no objections are filed the approval will become final. I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next three to five months.","The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy Holding Company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment. ","Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth and in earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.","Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of portfolio today we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Perspectival we will discuss performance for three primary business segments. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated Electric Utilities in the Carolina's, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments. ","As previously noted Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Business, which will contain Piedmont, our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky, and our gas pipeline investments such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont\u2019s existing joint venture investments. ","With the realignment of our business Commercial Renewable will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. With the divestiture of Latin American generation business, the balance of the international segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business in adjusted earnings per share until closing.","Turning to Slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our regulated utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment across management and operational excellence.","As a result of the strong result through the first three quarters of the year, we are trending towards the high-end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share, this excludes cost associated with Hurricane Matthew.","Turning to Slide 7, we are continuing to move forward and deliver strong results on our $30 billion growth capital plan, this plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions to generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders.","Here are a few updates, site preparation activities are underway and are nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019.","In September, we work with the Indiana office to be utility consumer counsel to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50 year facility, producing low cost, carbon free electricity for Indiana residence for years to come. For the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider.","Last week we issued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolina's service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers because project must be in operation by December 31, 2018.","Also in Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN for our Duke University combined heat-and-power projects. The projects will consistent of natural gas fired generated, that also provides steam service to the campus and lowers the University's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat-and-power projects represented an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other larger industrial customers in the years to come.","Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies and advance construction of our pipeline projects. Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution.","Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August and the project remains on track for June, 2017 in-service dates. Since our last earnings call, we have received FERC's notices schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, based on this schedule we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019.","In September the project partners announced the selection of Spring Bridge constructors as the lead construction contractor representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward leading U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline Construction Company with the extensive experience in similar projects. ","As you recall we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution Pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However in April of 2016 the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) refused to grant the project\u2019s water quality certificate. In response the project filed lawsuits with the U.S. court of appeal to the second circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York seeking to overturn DECs actions.","Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeal scheduled for November 16th and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling, as the northeast lacks adequate access of lower cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.","Before, I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know we manage through two major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricanes Hermine hit the south east in early in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers, and 150,000 Carolina's customers.","Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm stuck to our Florida and Carolina's Service Territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and wide spread flooding impacting many of our customers across the Carolina's. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont\u2019s infrastructure experienced minimum damage. ","In terms of customer outrages Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolina's Duke Energy Progress Service Area with damage similar in scale the Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989.","In response we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and our unwavering commitments to serving our communities. Given the magnitudes of the storm we intend to request a deferral of incremental cost and will ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy progress for the majority of damage occurred.","Our current estimate of incremental cost is approximately $200 million. We are still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimates. ","Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units at Catawba and McGuire's set new generation records and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter. ","Also in the third quarter Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic and environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company. ","In addition, we were named as Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 utilities in economic development for the 12th consecutive year. Another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investments and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.","In conclusion, I am very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We are advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well-positioned to deliver strong predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors.","Now let me turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Young","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I\u2019ll close with looking heads to 2017 and our key investor considerations.","I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.","As a remainder, this is the last quarter for existing segment structure. We began managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition.","On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter.","This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments which contributed to an $0.08 increase.","Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolina's and grid investments riders in Ohio continue to be favorable drivers of earnings adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Whether normal retail volumes also added $0.04 with growth primarily in the Carolina and Florida, I\u2019ll discuss those details in a moment. Finally, our cost management efforts across the business provided the $0.02 uplift, despite additional storm cost in the third quarter.","Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M cost and finding efficiencies throughout our business, position us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. Commercial portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter, the higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months.","Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter, largely driven by our higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlements. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the regulated utilities segment. For the year we continue to expect a total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31%, compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realize at international in the first quarter.","Our first three quarters have been strong reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter, in regulated utilities we have taken the opportunity to re-plan some of our O&M work including advancing a fossil plant outrage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. ","In addition, the prior year results included the favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. Meanwhile at commercial renewables we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment.","With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter we are trending for the high end of our original guidance range excluding cost associated with Hurricane Matthew.","Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth.","Overall we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continued to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continue to partially offset this customer growth.","Recently we have seen the decline in usage per customer beginning to level out of it. Looking forward positive trends in new job and wage growth as well as a recovery and housing are positive signs for continued residential growth.","Moving to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months and improvement compared to last quarter. Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as non-manufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continue to decline, even with new office space being added. These improvements were somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing.","In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors especially in the Midwest. In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However the metals industry is once again experiencing declines. We will closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017. ","Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DET's South Carolina rate case. In October we reached a constructive settlement with the office of regulatory staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission and Staff Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing, we requested that the $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of 1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase.","The settlement provides for the $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017.","Customer rates would be implemented over a two year period in year one customer bills will increase by $38 million then step up to $56 million in year two. DEP will reduce its cost to removal liability by $18 million in year one to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement coal ash cost that had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15 year amortization period and we agreed to differ any future rates cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone and we expecting an order from the commission in the coming weeks.","With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice we will provide guidance for 2017 including a five year capital plan during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses electric and gas infrastructure and commercial renewables of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range.","Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017 a strong first year reflecting the benefits of early integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. International results through closing use of sales proceeds and National Methanol are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevalent Brent crude oil prices in our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to set down in 2017.","The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion will displace future financing at the holding company and we will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. We estimate first quarter operating results from our international business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February.","I\u2019ll close with Slide 13, Duke Energy has tremendous scale offering in attractive investor value proposition which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends overtime. Within months we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low risk, high quality earnings and cash flows, and supporting our long term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.","With that let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We will take our first question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Could you discuss in a little more detail the -- I think you said that there was a -- the results from commercial renewables was not as what you expected. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the issues surrounding that.","Lynn Good","Michael, I would you direct you to the Slide 16 of the deck which gives you a comparison of where we are for year-to-date results against original expectations. Can you see commercial has delivered about 65 million of net income against our original expectations of a 140 million. We are not expecting that will deliver a 140 million for \u201916. Some of that short fall will be the result of lesser capital deployment as Steve mentioned, returns have been very market driven, so break for customers but load for investors.","And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind on solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So those are the two things that I would point too.","Michael Weinstein","Is it that the market for investment has become more competitive than you expected, let's say, a year ago, that returns on acquisitions are just smaller than you thought? Or is this more of a weather issue?","Lynn Good","I think returns are lower, Michael and I think the other thing to consider for Duke as an investor we are in an NOL position as a result of bonus depreciation and so as we look at returns we consider that the monetization of tax credits need to reflect when we will be a cash tax payer, so the DCF of that can challenge our returns. So that's something that we\u2019ll continue to monitor.","As the time progresses we understand the market well, we have great expertise in both wind and solar base on the business that we've built, we still like for business, but we are declined in the way we deploy the capital based on the returns we\u2019re seeing in the market.","Michael Weinstein","How long does that NOL position go out to? What do you expect?","Steve Young","As currently we are expecting assuming there are no further extensions of bonus that we would come out of the NOL position in 2019. We would then begin using tax credits ITC production tax credits, so we would still not be a significant cash tax player for a few years after that. ","Michael Weinstein","But that, in theory, could make the renewables business a little more competitive for you, right?","Lynn Good","I think as we get closer to that period of tax where we burn off the NOL that will impact our view of returns Michael, because the relative value the tax credits will be greater.","Michael Weinstein","Alright, understood. Thank you. ","Operator","Will take our question from Ali Agha of SunTrust. ","Ali Agha ","First question, Steve, the proceeds from the international sale, as you mentioned, you are going to use to pay off parent debt. Can you remind me, on average, what's the average interest rate on the debt that you are paying off?","Steve Young","When we did the calculation, we come up with roughly $0.05. We\u2019re looking at long-term holding company rate, might be in the 3.5% to 4% type range of that nature. So that's the basis of what we\u2019re looking at and we've baked that into our financing plans anticipating that to happen we\u2019ll initially take down some bridge facilities of shorter term with the proceeds.","Ali Agha ","Okay. But there is enough -- that high cost, or relatively high cost, debt available to get that kind of savings?","Steve Young","Well, what I'm speaking about is, we\u2019ve anticipated this and baked it into our financing plans to avoid issuances of hold co. at that higher level.","Lynn Good","So, Ali, if you think about it, as 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion of proceeds coming into the holding company. So the average rate as Steve reference is consistent with that.","Ali Agha","I see. Then second, the commercial results that you are getting, $65 million year-to-date, or $140 million for the year, I guess a little lower now -- how much of that roughly is the recognition of tax credits?","Lynn Good","Tax credits are going to be a significant part of the renewable return. Ali, I don\u2019t have an exact number in front of me, we do have a modest amount of contribution in commercial fund of pipelines at this point to the third quarter, we\u2019ll move that to the gas infrastructure segment in the fourth quarter.","Steve Young","That\u2019s correct. The results for the commercial portfolio reflects small amounts of AFUDC on the pipelines, that will be growing. But right now it is primarily from the renewables business and that is heavily driven by the recognition of the tax benefits.","Ali Agha","Got it. Last question. Lynn, as you look at this portfolio now, post the international sale, and you look at your utility footprint, is everything essentially core as far as Duke is concerned?","And related to that, as you are looking at growth over at least the next three, four years, does M&A come back into the mix for you as you are looking to deliver growth for shareholders?","Lynn Good","So Ali, the businesses that we earned coming out the transition are all core and I think the strength of the franchises we own in the South-east both Gas and Electric and then a strong position in mid-West are core businesses. And we\u2019ll be looking to drive growth for investment that build on cleaner forms of generation and strengthening our grid and driving growth and providing value to customers, that will be job one at Duke.","I believe M&A represents something that we will continue to look at as opportunity for rise, and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a track record of successful integration of M&A candidates, but job one, as I said is growing core businesses that we own.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We will take our next question from Maxwell Burke with Citi.","Maxwell Burke","So maybe just jumping back to your renewable portfolio, when you are underwriting these investments, do you generally assume that the PPA cash flows are going to cover the full investment cost? Or do you assume some residual value, post-PPA, in order to recover that investment?","Lynn Good","We will typically assign some terminal value beyond the contract period.","Maxwell Burke","Okay, got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, can you provide any guidance on how you think about valuation, post-PPA? Do you make some assumption around re-contracting, or do you apply a dollar KW [ph] multiple, or some other method?","Lynn Good","We look at a variety of things as we think about terminal value including forward curves as well as market experience. And so our contracts are the majority of the value that we are looking at and so terminal was something and we look at a range of possible outcomes.","Maxwell Burke","Got it, thanks.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Ms. Lynn Good for closing remarks.","Lynn Good","Thank you everyone for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We have made tremendous progress this quarter and look forward to see many of you in the coming months and at the EDI Financial Conference next week. Thank you."],"7992":["Duke Energy Corp.

We're about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan. Please go ahead.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2017 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents a safe harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on the key regulatory activity we have underway and the progress we have made as we continue to advance our strategic investment plan. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also share key investor considerations.","Before turning the call over to Lynn, I would like to thank Chris Bauer for his contribution to our Investor Relations team over the last two and a half years. This is Chris' last earnings call as he will assume a new role in our treasury department. Many of you have worked closely with Chris and I hope you will join me in congratulating him on his new responsibilities.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 for the third quarter, continuing to demonstrate growth in the fundamentals of our business. We advanced our long-term strategic investment plan while maintaining our focus on operational excellence. And our employees rose to the challenge of Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Atlantic.","Given our results through the third quarter, we are narrowing our 2017 guidance range to $4.50 to $4.60 per share. Even with $0.15 of below-normal weather year-to-date, including the lost revenues from Hurricane Irma, we'll deliver on our earnings commitment to our shareholders. This is a testament to the dedication of our employees and our focus on flexible cost management. We are also confident in our ability to maintain our long-term growth rate of 4% to 6% off of the $4.60 midpoint of our original 2017 guidance range. We remain focused on achieving growth at the high end of our range over time as our investments build and recovery accumulates.","Turning to our operational performance in the quarter, I'm proud to begin with our response to Hurricane Irma. This storm caused widespread, devastating damage across the Southeast region leaving nearly a 1.5 million of our Florida and Carolinas customers without power. And even though many of our employees' own homes and families were impacted by the storm, they put the needs of our customers first. Most of the damage was in our Florida territory with 1.3 million customers experiencing outages. More than 12,000 line and field workers rebuilt our system and restored power to over 75% of customers in just three days, and 99% within eight days.","Our initial storm restoration cost estimate for our Florida service territory is almost $500 million. The majority of this will be recovered through the existing Commission storm rule or transmission tariffs. After netting our current storm reserve balance of $60 million in storm related capital replacements, we plan to defer approximately $400 million for future recovery from customers. We can also request an additional $132 million to replenish the storm reserve. Under our current rate agreement, Duke Energy Florida is authorized to begin recovering both the storm impact and reserve replenishment 60 days after filing a petition with the Commission.","Based on our initial estimates, we believe the customers would see an approximate $5 increase on a typical monthly residential bill, assuming a three-year recovery period. We continue to refine our cost estimate as we prepare to file with the Commission by year-end.","We also received two important recognitions in the quarter. Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 12th consecutive year, acknowledging our commitment to a cleaner, sustainable energy future. And Site Selection Magazine named us as one of the top utilities in economic development for the 13th consecutive year, highlighting our work to attract businesses to our service areas.","We also reached an important milestone with the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This merger has truly been a seamless, textbook integration and we're happy to have our Piedmont teammates as part of Duke Energy. We look forward to investing in this business and expanding our natural gas infrastructure for years to come.","As you know, we have a busy regulatory calendar this year. Starting with Florida, we reached a constructive agreement with numerous parties in the state and the settlement was unanimously approved by the commission last week. We worked closely with stakeholders to reach an agreement that paves the way to a smarter energy future for our Florida customers. The settlement provides rate clarity through 2021 and allows us to recover up to 700 megawatts of solar energy and our grid investments, which will improve reliability and enhance customer choice. The agreement also includes recovery of investments in electric vehicle charging stations in a battery storage pilot program.","As part of the settlement, we will not move forward with building the Levy nuclear plant, and customers will not pay any further costs associated with this project. Our success in reaching this settlement is another example of our ability to achieve favorable outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. We will continue to engage constructively with stakeholders as we advance our regulatory modernization agenda across all of our service areas.","Slide six summarizes our pending North Carolina rate cases. Our Duke Energy Progress case is advancing and in mid-October, a number of intervenors filed written testimony advocating their positions on our request. This is a normal part of the process. As we've seen in past rate cases, the public staff and others typically recommend revenue adjustments. We remain confident in our positions and look forward to filing our rebuttal testimony this coming Monday, November 6 where we will respond to the arguments raised by intervenors. The hearings for the DEP case are scheduled to commence on November 20.","At Duke Energy Carolinas, our rate case is in the early stages. We recently received a scheduling order and intervenor testimony is due January 19 and hearings are scheduled for mid-February.","Slide seven outlines our strategic priorities to transform the customer experience by modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Let me share a few updates on our progress starting with our grid investments.","Today, we announced the expansion of our Power\/Forward Carolinas initiative into South Carolina. We plan to invest $3 billion in the state, consistent with our 10-year strategy to invest $25 billion in the grid across our jurisdictions. We commissioned a University of South Carolina research economist to study the potential impacts of this initiative. According to the findings, our investments over the next 10 years will deliver significant benefits to the state, including an average of nearly 3,300 jobs supported per year, representing almost $200 million in new salaries and wages annually, more than $100 million in new tax revenue for the state, and a total economic output of more than $5 billion. We're looking forward to making these investments on behalf of our customers and to support economic development in South Carolina.","In North Carolina, we announced plans for 13 megawatts of batteries spread across two sites as part of our Western Carolinas Modernization Project. And in Indiana, we'll be installing a 5-megawatt battery as part of our microgrid at Camp Atterbury. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy utility scale battery storage as costs come down and performance improves.","Shifting to generation, our W.S. Lee, Citrus County and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants are progressing well, and these projects remain on time and on budget. We are also moving forward with a dual-fuel project at our Belews Creek coal-fired plant in North Carolina, representing a combined investment of over $150 million between Duke Energy Carolinas and Piedmont. This upgrade will enable 50% natural gas co-firing on two units at the site increasing fuel flexibility and lowering carbon emissions. Piedmont has filed with the NCUC for permission to build gas infrastructure to supply the plant with natural gas. The project is expected to be completed in two phases, in 2019 and 2020.","During the quarter, we also saw important developments in each of our pipeline investments, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail and Constitution. Atlantic Coast Pipeline reached a significant milestone on October 13 when FERC issued the final certificate. This project will stimulate significant economic development in Eastern North Carolina and support growth in the region.","We are working with the relevant state agencies to secure remaining permits and expect to begin construction by the end of this year for an in-service date in late 2019. ACP also closed a revolving credit facility in October to fund approximately half of the pipeline construction costs. The project has borrowed $570 million against the facility to cover costs incurred to date with Duke's share at 47%.","Regarding the Sabal Trail pipeline, FERC issued a supplemental environmental impact statement on September 27. This addressed issues noted by the D.C. Circuit Court, which vacated the project certificate. FERC and other interested parties have filed with the court for a rehearing and we expect a favorable outcome. The project remains operational as we await the court's decision.","And turning to Constitution, the project filed a petition for a declaratory order in early October asking FERC to determine if New York failed to act within a reasonable time period on its water permit. We are hopeful FERC agrees with our position within the next several months, which would preserve an in-service date as early as the first half of 2019.","Before I close, let me say a few words about tax reform. Duke supports comprehensive tax reform. Like everyone, we are reviewing the legislation that came out yesterday. We were encouraged to see that the bill includes provisions to retain interest deductibility in lieu of the immediate expensing of capital. We're taking a close look at these provisions and the bill as a whole, but let me say this is a positive first step, and recognizes our industry and the importance of the impact to our customers, and we will remain engaged as the process continues to unfold.","As we near the close of 2017, our focus is unwavering as we execute our strategy and follow through on our commitments to customers, communities, and investors. We are on track to deliver earnings within our original guidance range for 2017, as we achieve planned growth in our regulated businesses and maintain our focus on effective cost management. Our long-term earnings growth profile of 4% to 6%, off our original midpoint of 460 is unchanged, underpinned by the strength of our regulated investments and our attractive service areas. This demonstrates the resilience of our company and the employees who deliver exceptional safety results, operational excellence, and financial performance every day.","Now, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. Today I will walk you through the key earnings drivers from the third quarter, discuss current retail volume trends, and update you on economic indicators. I'll close with a summary of our key investor considerations.","Let's start with quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide eight and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior-year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that occupy today's press release and presentation.","On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 third quarter earnings per share were $1.36, compared to $1.70 last year. The most significant drivers of the difference between the reported and adjusted earnings in the quarter were charges related to the revised Florida settlement agreement and certain commercial renewables assets.","Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.59, compared to $1.68 in the prior year. Lower results in the quarter were principally due to significantly favorable weather last year, and the absence of international energy earnings.","Moving through our segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure results were down $0.12 compared to the prior year. Weather was the primary driver, with a $0.14 decline quarter-over-quarter. This amount includes $0.02 per share of lost revenues associated with Hurricane Irma. Depreciation and amortization was higher in the quarter due to increased investments across each of our jurisdictions. Partially offsetting these drivers were higher revenues from increases in regulatory pricing and riders. Price increases were primarily due to investment recovery through the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida and new rates in Duke Energy Progress, South Carolina. With respect to riders, the strength of our energy efficiency programs continues to generate incremental earnings, helping to offset lower energy usage from our customers. Our Indiana and Ohio grid investments are also contributing to incremental rider growth.","Let me also highlight that O&M was $0.01 favorable, which includes $0.03 of costs associated with Hurricane Irma. This strong result demonstrates our ongoing commitment to managing costs across our business, and we will work diligently to find additional efficiencies and demonstrate flexibility as we close out the year.","In our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure segment, results were up for the quarter, primarily driven by our ongoing investment in the Atlantic Coast pipeline. As expected, the gas distribution results were flat during the warm summer months, and we anticipate these businesses will provide their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter.","Moving to Commercial Renewables, we were down $0.02 for the quarter. This was driven by lower solar ITCs in the current year, and higher interest expense as a result of new solar project financings this quarter. Finally, Other was up $0.14 for the quarter, based on a number of factors, including unfavorable tax adjustments in the prior year and ongoing tax planning activities. These accounted for $0.07 and $0.03, respectively. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 31% to 32%.","We also had a favorable litigation settlement and lower claims at our captive insurer during the quarter. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense at the holding company, primarily due to the Piedmont acquisition financing.","As Lynn mentioned, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.50 to $4.60 per share. This reflects our year-to-date results, including the approximate $0.15 impact of significantly unfavorable weather, and an additional $0.03 impact from Hurricane Irma, which were offset, to a large extent, by the cost management reductions we initiated earlier this year.","Turning to slide 9, I'll review our retail volume trends on a rolling 12-month basis. Weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.2%. If you remove the impact of leap day in the prior year, our rolling 12-month volume growth is in line with our long term expectation of 0.5%. The residential sector is growing 0.5% on a rolling 12-month basis, as population growth in the Southeast remains strong. This is particularly true in the Carolinas and Florida, where we are seeing residential customer additions of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. In Florida, every major metro area is experiencing population growth with Orlando and Tampa being two of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. Our combined gas utilities are also adding new customers at a healthy annual rate of 1.4% led by our Piedmont service territories which are growing at 1.6%.","As we look ahead, positive trends in employment and wages and the continued recovery in the housing market are expected to drive ongoing residential growth. Single-family building permits remain strong and are outpacing multi-family home starts in our service areas. As of August, Florida the Carolinas, and Tennessee are in the top seven states for the number of new single-family housing permits.","In our commercial customer class, sales across our jurisdictions were slightly down over the rolling 12 months. As we've experienced over the past few years, utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs partially offset growth in this customer class. We're seeing growth in hotels and restaurants; however the active hurricane season has caused some near-term interruptions for these businesses.","Turning into industrials, on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector has grown 0.1%. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continued to perform well. This strength is partially offset by the automotive sector and a recent slowdown in textiles.","On a macro level, manufacturers have reported significant improvement over the past 12 months. According to a recent National Association of Manufacturers survey, this customer class is more positive in its outlook compared to last year signaling future strength. Overall, based on our actual results over the past few years and our expectations looking ahead, we're confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth and feel good about the economic health of our service areas.","I'll close with our investor value proposition on slide 10. We offer an attractive 8% to 10% shareholder return that balances a strong, growing dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Our growth is driven by very low-risk, regulated investments that are supported by our strong balance sheet. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Shar.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, just touching on the grid mod, the $3 billion proposal in South Carolina. Is this kind of incremental to plan? And is there any status on the $13 billion opportunity in North Carolina, maybe just from a legislative standpoint? And when you roll in the $16 billion in potential opportunities, how does that sort of fit in with your 4% to 6%?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. You know, Shar, we have included in the plan we shared with you in February, grid investment that is generally consistent with these programs that we're talking about. We'll of course fine tune those in February when we give you an update on the five-year plan. And the approach that we've taken both in North Carolina and South Carolina is to complete economic impact studies for the benefits of these investments, also customer benefits that would be delivered directly. And we're in the process of discussions with stakeholders throughout both states, and what this investment potential could mean.","We have a couple of pads on recovery which we've talked about. Of course our ultimate goal is modernization of the regulatory framework in North Carolina to allow more timely recovery of these types of investments. But in parallel, we're also pursuing recovery of grid investment in our rate case for Duke Energy Carolinas. We'll pursue a similar path in South Carolina, probably approaching first through the regulatory process and determining whether anything further is required. So, I think this represents just further underpinning of the growth that we've laid out for you and why we have confidence in our ability to deliver at 4% to 6% reaching to the higher end of the range as these investments continue to grow and accumulate.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, higher end of the range. Okay, that's helpful. And then Lynn, think you've addressed this publicly in the past, but I'm going to put you on the spot anyway, because I know it's been on investors' minds. Is there any interest in a South Carolina nuclear plant or even expanding your footprint in the state, especially since you're already very active there from an economic development standpoint? If you could just address this dead on, it'd be good.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure. You know, Shar, we have no interest in the new nuclear plant in South Carolina and we've been clear about that. Given the risks and the uncertainties around completion of that plant, we don't think there's a fit either for customers or investors and we've been very candid with the state about that. As you indicate, South Carolina is incredibly important to Duke Energy. We operate important businesses and important assets in the state. We're announcing today our willingness to invest another $3 billion. So, we are continuing to operate well within the state. We're engaged and supporting our businesses in a way you would expect, but no interest in pursuing new nuclear.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to just touch base on coal ash spend and wondered if you could remind us in terms of the precedent with Dominion in the state and just your position on the treatment just as a refresher in terms of where we stand on your point of view on recovery of coal ash spend?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure. Stephen, let me take the Dominion question first. There is precedent in the State of North Carolina for recovery of coal ash in the Dominion case with return oven on. And similarly in South Carolina in our own case, we received recovery of coal ash and return oven on. As you know, this is an important topic in the North Carolina cases and we are in the process of reviewing the arguments that were presented by public staff and the intervenors and we'll be responding to those very comprehensively with our rebuttal testimony on Monday. We believe that these costs are squarely within the law. They represent environmental compliance costs, and we have pursued our approach around closure of basins and around the science and engineering necessary to support compliance with the federal and state law in a very appropriate, aggressive way with science and engineering underpinning our decisions every step of the way. We believe we have a very strong case that we'll put forward on cost recovery for ash.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And when you think about the period of time over which you do recover the costs, as you show in one of your charts, coal ash is a very significant portion of the revenue request. Is there a potential to think about a longer time period over which to have these significant costs spread, just as we're sensitive to thinking about overall customer bill impacts, or are there natural limits around thinking about duration?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Stephen, I think there's an opportunity to look at methods of recovery. If you look at our filing position, we put forward a couple of ideas for consideration by the Commission. There's a traditional deferral and amortization for costs incurred to-date and we proposed recovery of those over a five-year period. And then we also proposed a run rate, which would be to say including a certain amount in customer rates on a current basis, kind of matching the spend, which results in a lower overall cost, because it's without a return, right? It's as you spend it. We think that provides a fertile opportunity for discussion about what makes sense to customers. And that'll be a part of this case as you know. But flexibility around timing always is an opportunity.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then just shifting gears over to tax reform, I know we're all trying to very quickly absorb a lot of information in a short amount of time. I wondered if you might have any commentary on just the impact of holding company leverage in terms of your read of the proposal as it's laid out. I guess on my mind is just thinking about whether or not that interest is also exempted under the utility exemption that was included or if it's not exempted, if you can include the EBITDA from the utility businesses themselves, because they themselves are exempted. Just, I'm a little confused, honestly, in terms of thinking through the holdco level impact, so I'm just curious if you had any sort of preliminary thoughts on that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, Steven, you're raising a question that we're looking very closely at. And we are evaluating and reading it closely, not only at Duke, but as an industry. I think it's important to recognize that this was a positive step and I think there's clear recognition in the language of the capital we spend, the impact to customers, the importance of interest, forgoing capital expensing normalization, excess deferred taxes are transitioned in an appropriate way.","And so, when we look at the holding company, the area that we're focused on is this allocation to a trader business in a regulated utility and we'll be looking very closely at that, we believe, and we will also be engaged in discussions around intent and clarification and will be closely pursuing that over the next several days and coming weeks. But I think the important thing is, there's clear recognition of our industry in this framework, the importance to infrastructure economic development and we believe there could be a path forward on this.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Agreed, it was a helpful overall result for the industry. So thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Morning. Just to be clear, the $3 billion grid modernization plan for South Carolina, that's incremental to the previously disclosed $13 billion Power\/Forward plan or is that part of it?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's really part of the overall grid plan that we've got in our five-year planning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","But, it's incremental to the $13 million, Michael, because $13 million was North Carolina...","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Just North Carolina.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's just North Carolina. Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","...remaining in South Carolina.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. So, but it's not additive to the $37 billion CapEx plan. That's what you're saying, right?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct. That's part of all of our total growth capital in our five-year plan.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And given that there's been no settlement in the DEP case at this point in the process, do you think it's more likely than not that the North Carolina cases are fully litigated rather than settled? And how would you characterize that?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Michael, we can't comment at this point on whether we're engaged in settlement discussions or whether we will be engaged in settlement discussions. We're in a tight and important time period over the next couple of weeks. What we can talk about is rebuttal testimony on Monday, on November 6. I think that'll give you a very clear view of our response to the arguments that have been put forward. And then the hearing is scheduled for November 20.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Lynn. Thank you. Just to clarify, so I think you just answered. The $3 billion South Carolina plan is in your capital plan and 4% to 6% growth rate.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, that's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. And then, how ...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The only modification that I would make to that, Steve, is to say, we always fine tune these capital estimates as to timing, near-term, longer term. But you'll recall back in February, we laid out grid investment as a key priority of ours and what we've done is continue to put flesh on the bones and brand them and do the important work with stakeholders. So, it is part of that strategy we laid out. We'll be fine tuning where and how much as we go forward, but you should think about it as part of our strategic plan.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then, I think you also had a plan that you've at least talked about for North Carolina, in terms of grid modernization. Where does that stand, and is that in your capital plan too, or is it kind of same thing, it's part of the mix of different options?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, it's in the plan, Steve, in the same way I just described for South Carolina. And we are pursuing it on a couple of courses, right, the legislative initiatives that we've talked about. It's also \u2013 the DEC piece is also in our Duke Energy Carolinas case, which will proceed in early 2018. So we'll continue to update as we go. We're obviously looking for ways that we can continue to accelerate that investment for the benefit of our customers and achieve the appropriate regulatory outcome.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One clarification also, what is the renewables impairments, the adjustment that you made? What assets did you impair there?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. The impairment was of some wind farms in West Texas, the Ocotillo wind farm. That had been acquired quite a while ago, roughly 10 years ago. And as we look forward, we see a lot of exploration of the PTCs because these are older facilities, and those are uncontracted assets selling into the merchant market, and some of those prices are projected to be pretty low. So those factors led to the impairment of those assets. Most of our facilities, our renewable facilities, are contracted with third party off-takers. This is one of our earlier ones that was not.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just curious...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Lynn. Just curious how you're thinking about, once ACP comes online, so I'm thinking two years from now, in South Carolina, whether there is a need to have new gas midstream infrastructure in the state, especially since it seems that, with new nuclear plants now not moving forward in that state, you're likely to see an uptick in gas-fired generation burn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Michael, I believe there's a keen interest on the part of South Carolina for expanded and continued investment in gas infrastructure, for the reasons that you talked about. Our focus obviously is on the project as it's defined and constituted today, so it's been on \u2013 we're pleased with the FERC approval, we're moving forward with state approvals. But as the construction progresses, we'll of course be looking for ways that we can continue deliver value to customers in the states in which we operate.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So you're not seeing \u2013 I want to make sure I kind of understand what you're kind of saying there. You're not necessarily seeing an immediate need, meaning 2020 to 2025 timeframe, to have sizable new midstream into South Carolina yet?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I'm just not prepared to give you specific timing, Michael. So the timing that you talk about is certainly within our planning horizon. We want to get ACP in first, which is late 2019, so we'll talk more specifically about expansion opportunities as time progresses here. So I wouldn't read anything into when or where it falls in that timeframe, but we do believe that additional infrastructure could be important to our customers and to the states in which we operate.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And coming to the Carolinas on the electric grid modernization program, both in North Carolina and South Carolina, do you need legislation to get trackers or kind of more real-time recovery, or is that, in your view, something that each of the two Commissions could do without actually having to get a new legislation?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I believe the Commissions could provide tracking recovery in both states for this type of investment. And you see us making a request for that in the Duke Energy Carolinas case. I would also say that the Commission will give us feedback on that and if they believe additional clarification is required to the legislature, we could certainly pursue it there as well. So, I think this is something that remains an ongoing topic of discussion for Duke as we think about modernizing our system and delivering value to customers. We're engaged with stakeholders, we're talking about the benefits that this brings. And we'll just continue to progress it. We see it as a terrific not only opportunity for customers, but obviously investors as well.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Last item, O&M management, in terms of thinking about any synergies that might have existed as part of the Piedmont acquisition or just in general about being able to manage, to keep O&M either flat or even make it decline, where do you see the greatest opportunities within the organization over the next two to three years to manage O&M?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Michael, we certainly have recognized some synergies with the Piedmont merger, in fact, in excess of what we'd originally projected. Most of those are in corporate type functions. I think as we look forward over the next few years, there's a lot of opportunities for synergies, particularly in the distribution area, as we roll out some of these grid investments that we've been talking about. Smart meters will displace the need for meter readers. Technology along the grid will allow us to know how equipment is performing and help us optimize around maintenance activities. Those are examples of things to come. We've already seen great success in the generation areas around fossil and nuclear efficiencies, but we've got a lot of good functions that will continue to drive efforts in the efficiency areas.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Greg.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hey.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Every single one of my questions was asked, but I just wanted to ask a clarifying question on the tax issue.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Clearly, I'm not a congressman, nor am I a legal expert on these issues, but in reading the House Ways and Means Committee summary of the initial plan, it indicated that the interest deduction would be limited to the equivalent of 30% of any company's pre-tax income at the filer level. And so from my perspective, it would seem that \u2013 I mean there aren't any utilities that I do research on that even come close to that hurdle, including you. So it would seem to me that just based on that interpretation, you would, in fact, have interest deductibility on your parent debt. Are you just loathed to make an opinion on that, or you don't think that I'm reading it clearly?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know Greg, I think the clarifying question there or clarifying point there is, who is a filer? Is it the individual tax payers or is it an affiliated group and consolidated group? And I think, depending on that interpretation and the corporate structure of any utility, that will have a bearing. What we believe is that the combination of the allocation of interest to trades or businesses that are regulated coupled with the 30% and the structure that we have in front of us, we believe we've got a framework here that we can work with.","But as you know, it's 24 hours. Everyone's reading every word. Everyone's looking at all the interpretations. We're meeting with the industry. And I think the early read is, we see a lot of positive recognition of our industry. But we want to continue to make sure that we've got the appropriate interpretation and see if any clarification is necessary as this bill progresses.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's fair. Thank you. Have a great day.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Julien.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So perhaps just to follow a little bit up on the South Carolina program. Can you elaborate a little bit on the regulatory recovery thought process here, just in terms of the cadence perhaps of future rate cases, should you peruse the full $3 billion? Just how does that change versus what you'd previously articulated, if at all just be very clear about this?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Julien you may recall, we filed a South Carolina Duke Energy Progress case recently. So, we'll be evaluating capital investment to prepare that utility to go back in. And then, we're evaluating timing on Duke Energy Carolina, South Carolina and also looking at our investment plan to catch that case at the right time. So we always are fine tuning the regulatory calendar. It may move up, it may move back, but what we're trying to communicate today is we see grid investment as an important part of growth in those utilities and we'll be pursuing timely recovery.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. So would you say that barring at any novel trackers, whether approved by the Commission, or likely approved by the Commission or legislative, would you expect to be filing cases on a semi-regular basis in order to ensure kind of earned or near earned ROEs?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I think that's fair.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then maybe just following a little bit up on the gas side, obviously, I think at times you've kind of characterized the company as keen, or more keen to look towards gas into the future than perhaps electric. I don't want to put words in your mouth. How are you thinking about that today in terms of your future? And gas including midstream, utility, et cetera.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Julien, we couldn't be more pleased with the integration of the Piedmont system, not only in terms of the business that they bring, but the expertise and the focus on natural gas. And with the position that Duke holds as a company, second largest consumer of natural gas, we see that as a growing opportunity for us.","We're also pleased with progress on Atlantic Coast pipeline. I mean that's a $2 billion investment for us and we're anxious to get construction underway later this year. But we will continue to look for ways we can leverage our market position and expertise to bring investment into the gas business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","See you soon.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Lynn or Steve, when you look at your full plan, the $37 billion plan for CapEx, and as you mentioned, you've laid out the South Carolina proposal as part of that. As we sit here today, how much of that plan is now visible out there versus stuff that will eventually come, but hasn't yet been put out there, just to get some rough idea of that?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, I think the $37 billion has been well vetted here. We have very good ideas on the grid spend in terms of targeted undergrounding, smart meters, storm hardened equipment. When you look at the piece of the $37 billion, that's related to generating cleaner energy, we have generation facilities such as Citrus or Lee CCs. We've got \u2013 our gas growth portion of the plan, $6 billion is very well defined between ACP and the Piedmont distribution investment. So I think we have a very high percentage of plans that we can lay our hands on.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The Florida settlement also Ali, lays the path in Florida for both grid and renewables. And House Bill 589 in the Carolinas also provides a pathway on additional investment around renewables in North Carolina. So all of the steps you see us taking in 2017 are underpinning confidence in those capital investment plans. They're transparent, they're clear and understandable, and they're projects that we have expertise to deliver.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, thinking about the 4% to 6% growth rate, you obviously have two big rate cases right now and we should get clarity on that fairly soon. So, just given the timing of the rate cases, does that cause the earnings growth to be lumpy, perhaps more front-end loaded or are you thinking of it more straight line? How are you thinking about this 2017 through 2021 period?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You know, Ali, when we talked about guidance this year, we were clear that the plan we've put in front of you gives us the ability to be within the range every year and that is really in response to that question about, will you fall outside of the range because of general rate cases et cetera. The plan we've put in front of you puts us squarely within the range every year. And so that's what we're executing to. And as you know, we'll give you a fuller update on the specifics around 2018 and refinement of the capital in February.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And last question, Steve you mentioned the effective tax rate to think about is 31% to 32% for the year. Is that a good number to think about as we model future years or what should we think about future tax rate?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well that, again we will be rolling out our tax assumptions in February for upcoming five-year plan. But we've got to think about tax reform that's going on right now and assimilate where that's at. Certainly this year we've done some good work around tax optimization to bring in some tax savings that have lowered the effective tax rate a bit for us. But too hard to predict in the future given what's going on right now. We'll be working on that and rolling that out in February.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to ask two quick questions, the first on coal ash. Hypothetically speaking, let's say that you are unable to get the recovery that you guys feel you deserve, there, ultimately. What kind of leeway on spending do you have going forward, given the fact that you have kind of the lion's share to go, and you have the law that you have to comply with?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well Chris, we'll comply with the law. We have state and federal requirements; CAMA in North Carolina, CCR in the Carolinas, and then throughout our service territory. So that's what we are \u2013 we'll comply with all of those requirements. And we will aggressively pursue recovery, and we'll have more to say about that, of course, as we work through these rate cases. There are court appeals and other avenues we could pursue if we think that's appropriate. We believe we have a very strong case.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I know there's multiple categorizations of the ash ponds and timing associated with each one of those. But is there leeway on timing, in addition to what you just described?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","You're probably thinking about the risk rating in North Carolina, Chris. So we have certain sites that are due by the 2019, 2024, 2029. There are also timeframes within CCR. So you may have flexibility within a year or so, depending on how you ramp up the activity. But when you look at the project overall, the team is doing an outstanding job of balancing the compliance requirements with the spending in a way that minimizes cost to the extent we can, but of course complying with the law, as we always will.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question is on the renewables segment. I think the impairment this quarter was excluded from your adjusted EPS. So if we just look at the adjusted number year-to-date, looks like maybe you're falling a little bit short of plan. I think that segment last year also was not quite where you had originally wanted it to be. Anything we should be aware of there, versus your expectations?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","No. You know, Chris, the other thing I'd point to is, we've had weak wind resources in 2017, which has had an impact on results year-to-date. So we're continuing to operate the assets well. There will be weather variability, and there will be some variability around timing of projects, particularly those that are impacted by ITC, but nothing additional that I'd share with you from a strategic point of view on that segment.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question today from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks so much. So, if possible, can we go back to tax reform for one minute? Just wanted to understand, on this holding company debt and the interest deductibility on that debt. Is it possible, from the read, that holding company would be treated as a separate tax filer relative to the utilities, in which case obviously the utility, holding company, has no income and purely just an interest expense, if that were the scenario. Can that scenario play out, or do you think that's not realistic?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","No, you know Praful, we do have certain of our utilities flowing up into the tax payer called Duke Energy Corporation, just the way we are structured. And so, I think there are a couple of avenues we're looking at; this allocation to trader business, a regulated utility, and then of course the 30% test. So, we believe we see a path here, but it's 24 hours. We want to take the time to understand, get the clarification. But I think the progress that we've made in this, and the recognition of our industry, is something that should not be overlooked.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. And then secondly, on this Duke Energy Progress, the response from the staff obviously was quite conservative, in terms of the rate increase versus what you've asked. You seem pretty confident that you should be able to get to a good position there. Just any more color on that would be helpful. And what if you don't hit \u2013 like, let's say you get 50% of the ask. Just what does that mean for growth and 4% to 6% growth as well?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah, so Praful, I would point again to this rebuttal testimony that we're filing on November 6. We disagree with the positions that were put forward on ash in particular, as well as a number of other items that were highlighted in the testimony. We believe they're not supported by precedent or the law, and we'll make those positions very clear.","We are open to settlement discussions. Cannot comment on whether we are engaged or will be engaged in those discussions. But the process needs to play out over the next couple of weeks; hearing's of course on the [November] 20. And I think the potential implication to the financial results, we'll share with you when we have more information to share, and I think this is just a process that's going to need to unfold, not only over the next couple of weeks, but of course the Commission order is not expected until early 2018.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Well, thanks so much guys, and look forward to catching up with you yet. (52:55)","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Great. Thank you. And thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI and continuing discussion. So thanks again for your time this morning.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"7990":["Duke Energy Corp.

We're about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Noah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's first quarter 2017 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on the progress we have made against our long-term strategy including additional details about our grid modernization efforts. Steve will then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, insight about economic and low growth trends, and an update on our regulatory and rate case activity.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 for the first quarter. We had solid growth in our electric and gas utilities in the quarter driven by our ongoing investment programs. This was offset by the warm winter weather experienced across all of our jurisdictions. We're already taking action in leveraging our agile operations and ability to manage costs to offset the effects of the weather which Steve will discuss in more detail in a moment. With our strongest quarter ahead, we remain on track for 2017 and have affirmed our full year guidance range.","Through all of this, our focus on operational excellence has not changed and our commitment to safety is unwavering. Over the last six months, we've welcomed our Piedmont colleagues and I'm proud to share the recent accomplishments in safety and environmental stewardship as outlined on this slide. I may not quite sound like myself today. We're suffering from a spring cold so thanks for your patience and interest in Duke. The integration of Piedmont is well underway and we're pleased with the progress to-date. Merger integration can be a time of uncertainty but our Piedmont teammates have consistently delivered strong operational, financial, and customer performance. We're looking forward to a strong full year contribution from Piedmont in 2017.","Let me highlight a couple of very recent successes. In the Midwest, the American Gas Association awarded our Midwest LDCs the 2016 Safety Achievement Award. Our employees had the lowest incident rate for days away from work compared to our peers last year. Also, Piedmont was recognized as an environmental champion for the third consecutive year based on a nationwide survey. This is the result of our efforts to reduce vehicle fleet emissions and make our facilities more energy efficient. These awards are a testament to our industry-leading operational excellence and I'm proud of our employees and their continued focus on safety and efficient operations.","As we turn to slide five and six, we thought it would be appropriate to briefly revisit our strategic vision for the company which we discussed with you in February. Our industry is undergoing transformation from increasing customer and stakeholder expectations to rapid technology development and new public policy requirements. The companies that succeed in this environment are those who anticipate and adapt. We see great opportunity in this period of transformation to invest in infrastructure, our customers' value, and deliver sustainable growth for our investors. This strategy defines priorities for us every day, from investments to regulatory and legislative initiatives.","Slide six depicts how this vision is manifested and establishes our investment priorities over the next 10 years. We will invest in areas that position us well for the future including strengthening our energy delivery system, generating cleaner energy, and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Everything we do begins with customer service and we also understand that working collaboratively with our stakeholders is critical to our success.","On today's call, we want to highlight the investments we're making in the energy delivery system by, first, providing more details on our investment plans and, secondly, by sharing our recent experience in the Carolinas. Turning to slide seven, let me provide more details in our grid investment plan. The energy grid is a critical part of our nation's infrastructure, directly impacting nearly every part of our economy. Duke Energy's grid is the largest in the nation, stretching more than 300,000 miles. We have developed a comprehensive plan to create a smarter delivery system that positions our states for the future, delivering the reliability and services our customers expect.","While some tend to think of grid modernization primarily in terms of smart meters, our plan is more comprehensive. Our investments will help us to automatically reroute power and accelerate restoration through new technologies and core infrastructure upgrades. This will add connectivity, capacity, and control to the grid allowing the system to self-identify problems and react automatically to shorten or eliminate outages. Our targeted undergrounding program will replace select sections of poorly performing overhead lines, many located in hard to access areas.","Our plan will strengthen the grid as we upgrade transformers, replace aging cable and poles, install additional protective devices, and expand our flood mitigation work. We will also improve the grid's resilience against cyber attacks and physical threats through enhanced system intelligence programs. And to give our customers the tools to help them lower their bills and improve their experience, we are investing in smart meters, communications technologies, and upgraded systems. These investments will help us improve outage detection and better manage new grid devices including distributed generation.","Turning to slide eight, let me highlight an important example of recent progress in the Carolinas. In April, we announced our 10-year plan to upgrade and strengthen our energy grid in North Carolina. The initiative called Power\/Forward Carolinas will allow us to reduce outages and better serve our customers, helping to keep the lights on and businesses running. But the investment will do more than modernize our energy grid. It will enable more cost-saving solutions, provide additional reliability to customers, and serve as an economic stimulus for North Carolina communities.","We commissioned Ernst & Young to study the potential economic impacts of Power\/Forward Carolina. According to the study, our investment will create $21.5 billion in economic output over a decade, bring nearly 14,000 direct and indirect jobs to North Carolina, and contribute nearly $1 billion in state and local taxes that will flow directly into local communities to continue making North Carolina one of the top places to live and work. This long-term initiative was announced in April and the response has been positive as we continue to educate our customers and stakeholders on our plan and the benefits it will provide to the region. Our vision is to create a smarter energy grid. We have bold plans and I'm confident in our ability to execute the strategy across our service territories to better serve our customers in the future.","Turning now to slide nine, let me take a moment to update you on a few of our nearer-term strategic initiatives that lay the foundation for our future success. Progress continues on smart meter deployment around our system. To-date, we've installed over 2 million smart meters in our utilities including over 1 million in the Carolinas. In Indiana, our grid modernization efforts are well underway as we continue to roll out a smarter network in the state through the TDSIC program.","We're also moving forward with our work to generate cleaner energy with our investments in natural gas plants and renewables. Construction of our W.S. Lee, Citrus County, and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants remain on track and on budget. For more than a decade, we've been working toward a lower carbon future by modernizing and diversifying our system, including retiring older coal plants and building new natural gas plants and renewables. So far, we have reduced carbon emissions by 29% since 2005 and we're committed to advancing these efforts. With the recent release of our latest corporate sustainability report, we've introduced a new ambitious goal. By 2030, we plan to reduce carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level.","Work also continues in our three interstate natural gas pipelines as we invest in the needed infrastructure to improve access to this cleaner, cheaper fuel. In Florida, the Sabal Trail Pipeline is on track to be in service in June and construction of the lateral to our Citrus County plant remains on time to meet the planned service date. This summer, we expect the final environmental impact statement for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, keeping the project on time to begin construction in the second half of this year. State and local governments in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina continue to support the project as they understand the economic benefit of this critical infrastructure. Final FERC approval is expected by late summer or early fall which will require a quorum on the commission.","Regarding the Constitution Pipeline, we continue to believe this FERC-approved project will benefit customers in New York and New England, bringing much needed low-cost natural gas to the region. We're disappointed in the ruling by the U.S. District Court for the northern district of New York which was related to New York state permit requirements. However, we're still pursuing our appeal associated with the Clean Water Act water quality certification. We anticipate a decision on our appeal from the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals as early as the second quarter of this year. And our discussions with stakeholders continue and we will work diligently to complete the project with our partners.","In addition, we continue to engage with federal lawmakers and administration officials in Washington as they consider potential reforms to tax and infrastructure policies. We're actively advocating on behalf of our customers and shareholders as we meet with industry organizations such as the [EI] and congressional leaders. We will remain active on key issues facing our industry and support policies that keep customer bills low and spur economic growth while also ensuring the reliability of our system in protecting the environment.","We're off to a good start to the year. The fundamentals of our businesses are strong and we have a great team of dedicated employees focused on executing our strategy safely and efficiently. I look forward to updating you throughout the year about additional milestones we reached.","Now, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key earnings drivers from the first quarter, discuss current retail volume trends and economic indicators as well as provide an update on regulatory activity underway in several of our jurisdictions. I'll close with a summary of our key investor considerations.","Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide 10 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For a more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 first quarter earnings per share were $1.02 compared to $1.01 last year. First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04 compared to $1.13 in the first quarter of 2016. Lower results in the current year reflect the absence of International Energy results due to the successful sale of the business in December 2016 and the effects of warm winter weather. Removing the impact of weather, we see strong growth in the regulated businesses and a solid contribution from Piedmont.","Electric Utilities and Infrastructure quarterly adjusted results were $0.03 per share, lower quarter-over-quarter. This performance was primarily driven by the warm winter weather that we experienced over the past few months. In fact, this was the second warmest February and sixth warmest winter on record in the U.S, and our service territories in the Carolinas and Midwest set new record warm temperatures.","Partially offsetting weather was favorable O&M largely due to lower storm restoration costs in the quarter compared to last year and our ongoing cost management efforts across the business. Our target for 2017 reflected the reduction of non-recoverable O&M cost from 2016 levels and we're well on our way to achieving that goal for the year. In a moment, I will discuss additional cost efficiencies we're implementing to offset the warm winter weather in early 2017.","Results were also favorably impacted by higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio and Indiana. Additionally, we had new rates effective in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina and base rate adjustments in Florida. Retail volumes were also higher in the quarter. I'll speak to those results in greater detail in just a moment.","Gas Utilities and Infrastructure results were primarily driven by the contribution from Piedmont Natural Gas. For the quarter, Piedmont delivered $0.14 of earnings, excluding financing cost and share dilution. Despite the warm weather, Piedmont's quarterly results were consistent with their plan. Piedmont's LDC business benefited from existing weather normalization mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee and margin decoupling in North Carolina. These mechanisms help reduce volatility associated with volumetric change due to weather.","In the quarter, our average customer growth for our gas utilities was 1.2%, consistent with our expectations. This was underpinned by a strong customer growth of 1.5% in the Carolinas and Tennessee. Looking ahead, it is important to note that LDCs traditionally earn the majority of their profits in the colder months of the year and very little during the remaining months. Piedmont achieved nearly half of their full year plan in the first quarter and we expect the LDC to deliver the bulk of the remainder in the fourth quarter of this year.","Moving on, our Commercial Renewables segment was flat for the quarter. Increased production from new projects brought online in 2016 was offset by lower solar ITCs in the current year. Other was down $0.01 for the quarter. This was driven by higher interest expense at the holding company which was partially offset by increased contributions from our equity investment in National Methanol Company. Finally, recall that we completed the sale of our Latin American generation business in the fourth quarter of 2016, removing $0.17 of earnings from the quarter before consideration of the use of sale proceeds.","Cost management continues to be a strong focus for Duke Energy. Our continuous improvement efforts including the use of lean techniques to streamline our business processes and risk management assessments to eliminate low-value work from our operations align our cost structure to the evolving needs of our business. When we experience weaker weather such as that in early 2017, we will look for flexibility in our cost management practices.","As Lynn mentioned, we already have additional cost control plans in place and we'll mitigate approximately $100 million of the weather impact in the first quarter. Some of the opportunities we have identified will be sustainable cost reductions providing benefits for both our customers and shareholders for years to come. Given our size and scale, we can execute these efficiency efforts and we're confident in our ability to finish within the targeted range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share.","Moving to slide 11. Let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load growth was 0.2%. This was largely driven by lower than expected 2016 results in the industrial sector and the loss of leap day in the first quarter of 2016. However, first quarter 2017 results were strong. We achieved growth of 0.1% even with the loss of the leap day in the prior year. Taking that into consideration, sales volumes in the first quarter were up over 1%. One quarter is certainly not a trend, but it is encouraging and aligns with our long-term expectations for approximately 0.005% load growth over our five-year planning horizon.","The residential sector grew 0.5% on a rolling 12-month basis driven by strong new customer growth of 1.4% particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. As we've experienced over the past few years, utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs, for which we're compensated, and more energy-efficient building codes and standards continued to partially offset this customer growth. Current trends and new job and wage growth as well as recovery in the housing market are positive signs for continued residential growth. In fact, we've been closely monitoring the recent shift away from starts of multi-family homes to single family homes. New permit applications for single family housing starts are up over 10% across all of our service territories.","Commercial sales have improved by 0.5% across our jurisdictions over the past quarter and is up 0.6% over the rolling 12 months. Non-manufacturing employment continues to strengthen and office vacancies continue to decline across many of our service territories. In addition, we're seeing positive trends related to leisure activities including entertainment and restaurants.","Turning to the industrial sector. Though the class is down 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis, industrial performance in the quarter was strong with 0.8% growth. Industries that support construction and housing continue to do well. This strength is partially offset by industries that are more dependent on global trade given that the U.S. dollar remains strong. However, we're cautiously optimistic about the continued recovery of global economies as well as the resurgence of business investment. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns and update you throughout the remainder of the year.","Before closing, I want to highlight key regulatory activities underway in a few of our jurisdictions as highlighted on slide 12. In Florida, we have completed filings for the Osprey gas-fired plant that we acquired in January and our completed Hines Chiller upgrade project. Both of these filings were made under the generation base rate adjusted mechanism and were approved with new rates effective in February and April, respectively.","In Indiana, we completed our second semi-annual filing under the TDSIC rider for the next installment of costs covering the period July through December 2016. TDSIC-1 was filed last October and approved in March with rates effective April 2017.","On May 2, we filed our 30-day advanced notice with the North Carolina Utility Commission for our upcoming DEP rate case. We anticipate filing the notice for the rate case at DEC later this summer. New rates associated with these cases are likely to be effective in the first half of 2018.","I'll close with slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition which includes balanced growth and earnings and reliable dividends over time. The assets we have coupled with the strategy that produces real results offer a solid long-term investment opportunity. We're positioned to deliver growth and earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable, and transparent way, providing an attractive risk-adjusted shareholder return for our investors. As a capital-intensive business, our growth is supported by the scale and strength of our balance sheet which remains a continued focus for our company.","In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll pause for a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I have a question about the Carolinas grid plan, the $13 billion. Is the $4.9 billion of undergrounding reasonable for the proxy for the proportion to hold the $25 billion broader plan that would be from undergrounding or is that sort of more specific to this piece of it?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, if you're referring to slide eight...","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I think so.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. That's the Carolina view.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So if we look at the $25 billion, would the $4.9 billion sort of scale proportionately?","Lee T. Mazzocchi - Duke Energy Corp.","So it would not scale exactly proportionate. This is Lee Mazzocchi with the Grid Solutions group. We found that our heaviest concentration of densely vegetated lands that cause outages are really preponderantly in the Carolinas. We do have investments in Florida and the Midwest but they're not quite to the scale and the magnitude of what we're seeing in the Carolinas in the $25 billion.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's almost 40% of the Carolinas plan, that's what prompted the question.","Lee T. Mazzocchi - Duke Energy Corp.","You would see it less than 40% in the other jurisdictions.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just conceptually, how are you proposing that that would be socialized? Is it locally to the communities that sort of benefit from it or is that more across the whole system?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, we think there is a basis to treat this like any electric plant and service, and treat it as a rate base item. And what we're planning to do or are doing is using data analytics to identify the sections of our service areas that are affected by this, and that then has an implication to lowering our outage and outage costs which we believe all of our customers will benefit from. So it's a long-term investment around the improved reliability of the total system and we believe it brings great customer benefits and, of course, benefits to investors as well.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That makes sense. Great. Thank you. Other than FERC, what else do you need to move forward on ACP, if anything?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, Jonathan, there are other permits. Water processing permits, for example, in the states and we are working actively with all of the states to progress those permits on a timeline consistent with the FERC approval. And so we feel like we're on track with the timeline that we've laid out for you.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if I may. I think last quarter's call, when you sort of hinted that if you execute well on the plan the upper end of the guidance range could be in scope, I think the growth rate is based off the midpoint of the 2017 guidance. Having had this slower start to 2017, is that still something you think you can get to with cost offsets and the like or that's the case now?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jonathan, we remain on track. I mean, this is three months of a year against a five-year plan. The actions that we've identified for 2017 are really consistent with actions that we've taken when you have variability around weather. And so we've identified about $100 million and we'll continue executing on that on 2017. And then the investments that will ultimately drive growth are something that'll build over time, and we've given you some visibility on what those look like and where they're located and we're executing on all them.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Steve mentioned some of $100 million might flow through would be sustainable, I think was the word he used. Can you be sort of more specific as to what percentage of it?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","At this point I think it's pretty immature to get that granular, Jonathan. So when we go after costs, we're always looking for things that can be sustainable but also recognize just flexibility within the year can be helpful. So it's a combination of both. I don't have any more specifics that I'd share with you at this point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Well thanks very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Julien.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Perhaps just to elaborate a little bit on the last question. On the cost offsets here for the first quarter, I think you said about $100 million or so. Does that have any kind of ongoing benefit or is that really kind of a transient phenomenon? I think you suggested the former.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well I think it will have an ongoing benefit. I think many of these costs are accelerations of the cost efficiency efforts that are underway, so I think many of them will be sustainable. It's hard to define precisely at this point. But I would also discuss and mention last year, in 2016, we came out of the gate with storms and low volumes and we accelerated cost reductions of $100 million. Then when the weather came in the third quarter, we moved some work into 2016. So that type of dexterity can go both ways but, certainly, many of the cost reductions in 2016, and I think many that we're doing in 2017, will be sustainable throughout our five-year plan. It's hard to be granular at this point given the flexibility that we try to exercise.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. So just to be clear about this. This is basically fungible with the wider cost reductions you've been contemplating in the five-year program, right?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's certainly part of it. Absolutely.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Julien, what I would add to that is I think this point of cost flexibility is what we want to emphasize with this. So we believe we have the scale and the expertise from the work that we've done over a number of years to be flexible with cost management. And every time we go after cost in a given area we're always working to make it sustainable, and in that event it could be incremental to some of the things we've shared with you previously. But I think the expertise that we're developing around cost management is really fundamental to the business, and we had a good track record of executing.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Follow-up question here on coal ash if I can. Really just kind of curious. Are your plans at all changed given the shift in what seems like ELGs and CCRs at the federal level? I imagine not but I just wanted to clarify that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","At this point, our plans are moving forward, Julien, and you can think about at least the North Carolina business is having an implication not only from CCR but from CAMA, the laws in North Carolina. And so we're on track. We don't have any specific change of plans just to resolve all of these new executive actions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And lastly, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what kind of size of rate increase that we're talking about as a function of the forthcoming cases in North Carolina? Do you have a sense yet and how that might net against cost?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well on the increase, and maybe get to that second one in a second, Julien. On the increase, we'll share more specifics when we file for the increase which will be in about a month for DEP and then there'll be a notice and then a filing for DEC. So we'll, at that time, be in a position to give you more specifics on the composition of the filing as well as the percentage increase.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Hey, I was wondering if you could give kind of an update on legislative initiatives within the Carolinas especially as to how they might be interacting with your presenting of this plan on April 12. Is it all integrated into one kind of public push with legislators to get more riders in place going forward?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","So, Mike, we continue to engage with our stakeholders here in the Carolinas about our priorities and, certainly, regulatory modernization that fits the nature of the investments we're planning to make in the delivery system are a part of those discussions, as are renewables and integration of renewables into our system. So it's really early in the legislative session at this point, but there could still be some opportunities in the current session and we'll share milestones when appropriate. And in the backdrop, as you know, of all of these, the rate case filings that will also occur in 2017 in the Carolinas.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. I guess with 13,900 jobs projected for 10 years, are you getting support from any specific groups enough for that kind of program or...?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Mike, I think there's a lot of interest in infrastructure investment and job creation. I think that's in the Carolinas as well as around the U.S. And this represents really important infrastructure and gives North Carolina an opportunity to lead the way on infrastructure investment. And I think job creation particularly in the eastern part of the state that has been hampered economically is very attractive. So we believe this plan is a win-win for customers, for investors, and for communities.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just one last question. Is there any change to load growth guidance at all for electric load growth or even on the gas side?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","No. Our growth assumptions, I think, for our five-year planning horizon of 0.005%, I think those are still the viable and right place to be at this point in time.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Switching gears. You've made significant proposals in the state of North Carolina with regard to how PURPA is being used by solar developers to get contracts for large utility-scale solar. I'm not sure whether the commission has actually made a decision on the things that you've requested be changed in the way that you're forced to sign these types of PURPA contracts. Can you review for people because I think this is a little under the radar for some? What has been going on with regard to PURPA as it relates to solar in North Carolina, what you're asking for to be changed, and where will we stand in that process?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure. So, Greg, there are couple of things going on. In the regulatory arena, we made an avoided cost filing which addresses the price, the term, the size of these facilities, and that went to hearing in mid-April. There is, of course, the position of the other parties and the public staff in North Carolina has testimonies that I think would be helpful for investors to take a look at. And really what's being proposed is an opportunity to move this development of renewables and solar in the state into a more sustainable model. So in addition to size and price that we're pursuing on the regulated front, we're also having discussions in the general assembly about the development of a competitive process on an annual basis with a determined size that would give solar developers and also the utility an opportunity to plan. We also think a competitive process would impact price to customers and believe that better planning and better pricing would create a more sustainable market.","And so there are two things to track here, not only the regulatory proceedings, avoided cost, went to hearing in April \u2013 that's moving through as procedural process \u2013 but also continued discussions in the legislature about sustainable solar development in the state of North Carolina.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","The bottom line is that \u2013 and this is me summarizing it, not you -the solar developers have been using PURPA as an opportunity to get above market contracts and you're looking for a process that's more transparent so you can be more comfortable, that you're not burdening your customers with solar contracts that are not economic relative to market. Is that fair?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Greg, I think that's fair. We've done some calculations of the prices implied in these contracts, and we believe it's costing customers about $1 billion more than a market price would cost them over a 12-year period. And this notion of better planning and better pricing, we believe, can create more certainty not only for the solar industry but better pricing for customers, and I think that's important as this market continues to develop.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Real quickly. On the capital budget for the next few years, you've made a few announcements in just the last few months, even one or two since you reported fourth quarter of 2016. Just curious, any significant changes to the capital budget over the next few years? And if so, which jurisdictions?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","No significant changes, Michael, over the next five years. Some of the timing may be a bit different. But we've got a capital plan, $45 billion to $50 billion over the five years, and that's where it's going to be at at this point.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just curious, Lynn. How are you thinking about the opportunities at the renewable business, and how the growth over the next couple of years will look relative to the substantial number of megawatts you added over the last two to three years?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, when we put forward our plans in February there's a shift in the renewable investment more toward regulated investment than commercial, and we think that just makes good sense for not only investors but customers in our jurisdictions. So we have about $2.5 billion in the five-year plan; about $1.5 billion sits in the jurisdictions and $1 billion in commercial. And so I think we've shared with you that we're looking at that commercial investment very closely. Returns are tight, the tax position is uncertain for us at least over the next couple of years, and we'll continue to make the right decisions about deploying capital in that commercial business as we see returns that fit our expectations.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And are there opportunities with that renewable business regarding either, potentially, to add more via less on the development side and more via on the acquisition of whole portfolios? Or on the flip side, is your portfolio potentially more valuable and have you assessed that in the hands of, maybe, other parties?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, Michael, we continue to look at what we own, its value and contribution as well as what it might command on the outside. So those are ongoing assessments that we do. We feel like we have a really strong portfolio of 3,000 megawatts wind and solar, backed by a long-term contract. And so those are assessments that are ongoing but nothing specific to share with you today on a strategic analysis or initiative that we're considering.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So firstly on the holding company debt. You continue to have a target of about 35% holdco debt to total debt for 2017. I just wanted to understand. Given tax reform expected to come at least, is there any view that you want to, over time, reduce that number or how are you looking at that? And if there is any goal to reduce it, what levers or tools do you have to bring down that holding company debt over time?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Well, Praful, when you look at our five-year plan, you do see over the five years the holding company debt level does decrease. Our credit metrics improve over the five-year plan. We're still issuing holding company debt because we're growing over that five-year period but the ratio to total debt does decline. So that's part of our five-year plan that we've baked in under current tax laws.","Now regarding tax reform, it's hard to say where that's going. Proposals are still in very early stages. It hasn't gotten very far. We'll continue to keep our eye on that and we've been assessing other scenarios and other ways to finance if that were to change significantly. But overall, we feel good about our balance sheet and our ability to deal with the holding company debt.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And then secondly in terms of the cost saving initiatives. It seems like it's almost dry powder that you used to offset any weather impacts. I wanted to understand if that's a fair characterization, and if it is why not do more? As in, why not do more rather than wait for weather and use it as dry powder? I'm just trying to understand how you kind of think about the cost savings.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, I would suggest that we've been very aggressive on cost savings. If you look at the track record of Duke, we've had flat O&M for a number of years and are projecting flat through 2020. We think that's aggressive and we continue to focus on ways we can drive costs out of the business, and that is our job every day. But what we're talking about here is flexibility as a result of weather where we may make some decisions in a short-term basis in order to offset weather. It could be holding a vacancy, it could be working with a contractor differently, things of that sort. But you should take away that we understand the assignment of being very aggressive with our cost structure and we are achieving that with initiatives throughout the company.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. First question, Lynn or Steve. Can you remind us? When you talk about the 4% to 6% CAGR in earnings, is that fairly linear? Or given the timing of rate cases and rate increase, there is a lumpiness factored into that as well?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, we shared in February that every year we'll be within the range, that we've developed a plan that puts every year within the range. And so I think that's the way I would respond to that question. And we will have rate cases in 2017 that are important to 2018 and we'll give you more update on those milestones as we go forward.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then overall, just remind us, perhaps, on an LTM basis as well what's the current regulatory lag in the system and where within your jurisdictions are you seeing the biggest lag right now?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, we had talked about regulatory lag over the past couple of years, and it'll vary depending upon the timing of base rate cases that we'll see. But we see most of our regulatory lag in the Carolinas jurisdiction where you have recovery mechanisms through riders or decouplings, similar to what we see in our gas business at Piedmont, you have less lag. And we're trying to work to minimize lag through various initiatives in our regulatory jurisdictions. Most of the lag, I would say, is in the Carolinas jurisdictions at this point in time. Again, it's hard to put a specific number on it in terms of how much it'll pull down in any given year. Specifically, it'll just depend upon the timing of rate cases.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And, Steve, as you look at that five-year CapEx plan and the funding of it, when at the earliest should we be thinking about equity coming back into the picture from a funding perspective?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Our five-year plan contemplates the use of a DRIP starting in 2018 throughout the remainder of the plan, and we estimate that to be in the ballpark of $350 million a year. So that's in our base plan.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see, okay. And last question, also remind us. Within the commercial earnings and net income right now, roughly how much of that is recognition of tax credits?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Ali, I would say the majority of the tax credits. If you think about it, it's primarily a renewables business. PTCs are the lion's share of it because our portfolio is primarily wind.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So PTCs more than ITCs?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Wow. I got a question.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello, Andy.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","How are you guys doing.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","We're good. How are you?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","I'm doing all right. It's kind of cold here, though. What can we do.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","It's warm out here.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Still kind of spring winter. Hey, just a couple of very, very quick questions. On the cost savings that you did this quarter, is there like a breakdown? I don't expect you to have it specifically, but is the majority in a certain jurisdiction or is it kind of across the board?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","The delta on the O&M this quarter, Andy, I would think about as being across the board. But the one thing you should note, that first quarter of 2016 had a lot of storm restoration in it. That was primarily Carolinas, so the delta over the quarter is being influenced by that. The $100 million as we go forward over the balance of the year, you can think about that as being across the company.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. But the $100 million is exclusive to the storm restoration change? Is that correct or not?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's not correct. So two things I would point to. If you look at our actual versus actual announcements for the first quarter, O&M is the positive driver. And that positive driver is primarily the result of the fact that 2016 had storms in it and 2017 doesn't.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. Because I guess what I was trying to figure out was not all of the \u2013 and I think Julien had asked the question, too, but I think you forgot to answer the last part of it. As you think about the rate cases you're going to file in the Carolinas, I guess in this case for the quarter and depending on when the test year is, obviously you've had a lot of cost savings. So to the benefit of the customers, those cost savings will be passed on and that'll lessen the blow of any type of rate increase. But I guess also even this $100 million or the cost that you achieved in the first quarter, that actually is offset by the storm restoration that you did. Did you collect the storm restoration or you didn't? Do you understand what I'm getting at? I'm just trying to figure out \u2013 again, I know we have to wait for your rate case to be filed \u2013 but I would assume there's some good cost to offset the increase. Is that correct?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. Let me try to...","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","And how should we think about that?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. Let me perhaps give some clarity on a few things. We'll file for these rate cases with a 2016 test year and then there are other things you make to that. And you try to look at sometimes normalized cost levels within that, looking at storms and so forth. So I don't think you can draw a definitive conclusion about a cost level in a particular period of time and what it might mean. I would say the ongoing cost efforts that we have to reduce costs, they offset salary increases, inflation, and so forth. So if you recall, in February we talked about our goal is to keep our non-fuel O&M flat through 2020 and we think we can do that and, in fact, reduce it a bit here in 2017. So I'd look at costs more holistically in that way, that we're keeping them flat and maybe slightly reducing them as well, offsetting a lot of the inflationary and salary increase impacts.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And Andy, on the storms, you may remember we filed a deferral request. It's not Hurricane Matthew and Jonas and Hermine. I mean, there were a number of storms impacting. And that deferral request will be a part of this rate case in the Carolinas.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Got it. That's very helpful. And then my last question is just kind of basic for both of you and just how you're thinking, and I understand what you're saying about equity going forward. But with your stock price doing very well at $0.82, $0.87 at the moment, down $0.05 just to give you a report.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","And then you look at, like, PPO kind of decided to fix their balance sheet a little bit because their stock price has been doing well. I guess it's one of the reasons. There are other reasons, too. And the stock actually is up 13.5% this year even though they decided to issue incremental equity. And so I guess what I'm trying to get at is because if I kind of ran the numbers and doing a mid-sized equity offering now would actually help you on your credit metrics \u2013 and I'm talking about more of the balance sheet, not your FFO and the debt, obviously \u2013 and it would be kind of a one-day type event. Why not kind of go now and try to kind of take down some of that parent debt and issue some equity since, obviously, you have a lot of CapEx? I mean, you understand what I'm getting at. I'm not going to just keep going, but just kind of what's the big thinking of that, with the stock prices so high?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Yeah. Steve may have something to share on this as well, but we are very comfortable with our balance sheet. We believe the portfolio transition and the businesses that we own are very low risk. We have an improving profile in our balance sheet as a result of the strength of this plan. We believe the DRIP is an effective way to issue equity that matches the deployment of capital over time. So we always evaluate financing techniques but believe this is the most appropriate one given where we are.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. And Steve, do you have anything to say or we're good?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","No. We're good.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Andy, thank you. All right.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Have a great Mother's Day, Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Andy.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Well thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your interest in investing in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you over the next several months, and we'll continue to keep you updated on our key milestones.

After the prepared comments this morning, Jim and Lynn will take your questions.And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim Rogers.Jim RogersThanks Bob. Thank you all for joining us today. The end of 2012 marked our first six months following the combination of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. By December 31st, we had turned an extraordinary year of uncertainty into a year of great accomplishments both operationally and financially and especially pleased with the resilience and dedication of our employees. Throughout the 18 months approval process in the first months of the new emerged company they were focused on providing affordable and reliable electricity 24\/7 to our 7.1 million customers and providing superior value to our investors.Slide four, highlights a few of this specific accomplishments of our people in 2012. We successful closed the Duke Progress merger in early July. This merger created primarily regulated utility business with the scale to drive efficiencies for our customers and our shareholders. Also the Indiana Commission approved the Edwardsport IGCC settlement providing us clarity on cost recovery of this important project. We had strong operational performance last year; we often say that Stacy comes first. 2012 was a testament to our focus, during the year we achieved the best employee safety record in the company\u2019s history. It is a tribute to our employee\u2019s commitment.Our nuclear team achieved a fleet capacity factor of over 90% from the 13 straight year excluding Crystal River 3. We successfully completed three major new power plants in North Carolina all within budget. We completed five new wind farms and three new solar farms at 650 megawatts of net renewable capacity to our portfolio. We also had a very strong financial performance in 2012 by achieving each of our overall financial objectives. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.32 was at the upper end of our earnings guidance of 4.20 to 4.35 for the year. We continued to grow the dividend by approximately 2% while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Our total shareholder return during 2012 outperformed the Philadelphia Utility Index. From merger announcement in early January 2011 through the end of 2012 Duke Energy\u2019s total shareholders return was around 32%, this significantly outperformed the 17% return of the index during the same period. On our last call we reported on our key near term priorities. We have been focused on since merger closed. As demonstrated on slide five, we\u2019re making excellent headway in resolving these priorities. I will mention the highlights and then going into more detail in later slides.First, in December we successfully resolved the North Carolina investigations into the post-merger CEO change. Resolution enables us to move forward and focus on our rate cases in the Carolinas which are also near term priorities. These cases are being driven large part by the necessary capital investments we have made in our fleet modernization program. Progress Energy Carolinas filed its rate case in North Carolina last fall.This was the first time P&C had sought a rate case increase in North Carolina in 25 years. The evidentiary hearing begins in March and we expect revised rates to be affecting by mid-year. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a rate case last week in North Carolina and will follow case in South Carolina next month.As a reminder we also have two pending rate cases in Ohio and electric distribution case and a gas distribution case. Second, early last week we announced our decision to retire the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida. Third, in December the Indiana Commission improved a settlement agreement that provides clarity on cost recovery for the Edwardsport project. Construction is complete and the plan is undergoing testing. This plant will serve the needs of our Indiana customers for decades to come in an environmentally responsible manner.","We also continued to make progress on the other near-term priorities. We remain focused on delivering our merger integration initiatives. We are being very disciplined about this work and are on track to achieve the intended savings and efficiencies. In fact, we are ahead of schedule in fuel savings. Approximately $52 million of savings were recognized in the last six months of the year. By year end 2012, about 700 employees have left the company through the voluntary severance program. Most of the remaining 400 employees who had elected this program will leave by the end of this year.Finally, our nuclear fleet as a whole performed extremely well in 2012. We continued to leverage best practices across the fleet and take advantage of having 11 rectors in the Carolinas. We are also making additional investments to optimize safety, reliability, and efficiency.Now, let\u2019s turn to slide six in the Crystal River 3 retirement decision we announced last week. This nuclear unit in Florida has been safely shutdown and offline since late 2009. As you all will recall, the 2012 regulatory settlement approved by the Florida Commission gives us the sole discretion and flexibility to retire this nuclear unit. This was a difficult decision. It came after comprehensive analysis of cost, risk, and other factors involved in attempting a complex most of the time repair versus retiring and decommissioning the plant. After completion of the technical and economic feasibility studies, we determined that a repair is technically feasible, but it included significant risk that can greatly increase the cost of repair and extend the repair schedule. As a result, we concluded it is in the best long-term interest of our customers and investors to retire the plant.Additionally, since the fourth quarter of last year, we have been in mediation with our insurance provider to resolve our outstanding claims related to this plant. Both parties have accepted the mediators\u2019 proposal. Consequently, Neo will pay the company additional $530 million. Along with the $305 million that Neo has already paid, our (Florida) customers will have $835 million in insurance proceeds, the largest claim payout in the history of Neo. Deciding how the best move forward and Crystal River 3 has been one of our top priority since the merger closed last July. It is important for everyone as we reached the right decision and provide clarity on this issue.We intend to use the same store option for decommissioning the plant and are working on a comprehensive plant. This option involves putting the unit in a safe condition for 40 to 60 years before decommissioning. As a result of this lengthy time period, we expect that our current decommissioning fund balance of approximately $600 million will be sufficient. We expect that the Florida Commission will review this retirement decision and the acceptance of the mediators\u2019 proposal resolving Crystal River 3.Next, moving to slide seven which provides key facts about the rate request, Duke Energy Carolinas filed in North Carolina last week. This is the third in the series of three rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolina to recover its capital investments to modernize the generation of fleet. We have requested a net increase in annualized customer rates of $446 million or an average of 9.7%. This is based upon a ROE of 11.25% and 53% equity component of the cap structure and a North Carolina retail rate base of approximately $12 billion through the estimated date of the hearings. Around 90% of the requested rate increase was due to capital investments. These include the Cliffside advance coal plant and the Dan River combined cycle natural gas plant both previously approved by the commission. Although the commission has not yet established a procedural schedule we expect that hearings will occur early in the third quarter revised rates effecting in September. Turning to slide eight, I will summarize the recent regulatory approval of the settlement agreement related to our Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana.The latest number, the Indiana Commission approved a settlement agreement that was reached with several interveners addressing the cost recovering for this coal gasification plant. The agreement includes a cap of $2.595 billion on the construction cost that retail customers will pay.As shown on the slide the commission made two modifications to the agreement. One involves a $28 million refund to customers which is reflected as a special item for the quarter, the other provision pertains to any potential recovery you will see from vendors on the project.Any amount receive in excess of the cumulative impairments recognized on the project will be refunded to customers. Construction in the plant is complete and we\u2019re in the final phase of testing that is required before we put the plant into service. Both gasifiers have successfully achieved syngas production, we expect the testing to be complete and the plant to be in commercial service by mid-year.Slide nine summarizes our major construction projects, these include the Edwardsport plant, the three plants brought online in 2012 and the Sutton combined cycle gas plant scheduled to be operational by the end of this year. We continue to advance our $9 billion multi-year fleet modernization program.This program has put us ahead of the curve in our industry in terms of preparing for compliance with stricter environmental regulations and by building several new natural gas plants we are increasing our fuel diversity giving our customers the benefits of low natural gas prices. These new plants will allow us to retire upto 6800 megawatts of older less efficient coal 5 units by 2015.At the end of this year we expect to have retired more than 3800 megawatts of this capacity. As a combined company we have already invested around $7 billion in control equipment for our existing coal plants positioning now for compliance with more stringent air emission regulations. However we estimate we will spend an additional $5 billion to $6 billion over the next decade to comply with pending environmental regulations on air, water and coal ash.Next turning to slide 10, I will provide a brief update on our commercial businesses, primarily focus on our operations in Latin America and our non-regulated mid-west generation of fleet. I will start with Duke Energy International. During 2012, we expanded our investments in Latin America adding assets in Chile. Our objective with DER over the past six years has been to add generation to our portfolio that meets our risk and return expectations. The assets in Chile meet these expectations and are great compliment to our existing Latin America business. In July we acquired 240 megawatt diesel generating facility then in December we announced a $415 million acquisition of two existing hydro facilities.We expect to close on a project financing for around half of the purchase price by the end of the first quarter 2013.Brazil also continues to be an important part of our portfolio and we are monitoring two emerging developments. First, Brazil has recently been experiencing low rainfall. Even these conditions have recently improved reservoir \u2013 even though these conditions have recently improved, reservoirs remained low. If these unfavorable conditions persist, the cost of operating in the system may increase for all generators, including Duke. We are closely monitoring the reservoir levels and we will update you on our Analyst Day the end of the month.Additionally, the Brazilian government recently finalized a new law addressing exploration of generating concessions granted before 1995 and said to expire between 2015 and 2017. We are monitoring this closely. We do not see a direct short-term impact on our Brazilian operations, because our concession agreements were granted after 1995 and do not expire into 2029 and 2033. Over 90% of our available Brazilian capacity is contracted in 2013 and \u201814 with over 60% being contracted for in 2015 and over 50% being contracted for in 2016. We will continue to monitor marketing conditions as we contract our open positions.Next, let me talk about Midwest generation. As you all know, we have a cost based capacity filing currently pending with the Ohio Commission. Through our request, we are seeking appropriate compensation for our capacity services as provided for under Ohio law and consistent with the new state compensation mechanism adopted by the Ohio Commission. Parties to the case filed comments in early January and we responded earlier this month. Hearings are scheduled for April this filing does not speak to alter the Electric Security Plan or ESP, under which Duke Energy, Ohio is currently operating. Clarity on our filing will inform our long-term strategic decisions about the Midwest generation fleet.Finally, let me recognize the work of our commercial renewables team in 2012. During the year, we brought online around 650 megawatts of additional net owned capacity. This increased our wind and solar generation to more than 1700 megawatts.In summary, I am very pleased with what we accomplished in 2012. We completed a complicated complex merger. We delivered on our financial and operational objectives. We are resolving our priority issues one by one. Our employees have shown remarkable resilience. We are building positive momentum and have the right focus and foundation to continue delivering value for all of our stakeholders in the future.Now, I will turn it over to Lynn who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance in 2012.Lynn Good","Thank you, Jim. Today, I will focus my remarks on our full year 2012 results and briefly summarize our quarterly results. And we\u2019ll also provide an update on our customer load trends as well as economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I will close with an overview of our performance against our overall financial objective.Let me start with the discussion of our financial results for 2012. As Jim noted, we had a very successful year from a financial perspective as we continued to achieve each of our stated objectives. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS within our annual guidance range. We achieved an average annual growth and adjusted diluted EPS of approximately 5.7% from our base share of 2009. At the upper end of 46% growth objectives. The increase of our quarterly dividend payment by approximately 2% and we maintain the strength of our balance sheet. If you look at slide 12, our fourth quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings were $0.70 per share essentially flat with a $0.71 for the prior year quarter, for the full year 2012 we recognized adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.32 compared to $4.38 for the prior year. 2012 adjusted earnings reflect the addition of earnings from Progress Energy that of the impacted of shares in connection with the merger. The impact of the new market based electric security plant in Ohio and unfavorable weather.These drivers were partially offset by higher customer rates at Duke Energy Carolinas. On a reported basis our earnings for the fourth quarter 2012 were $0.62 per share, compared to $0.65 for the prior year and for the full year our recorded earnings were $3.07 per share compared to $3.83 for the prior year. Please refer to the reconciliation schedule included with these slides for details on the differences between our reported and adjusted results. For more information on the quarterly and annual drivers see the earnings variance table on pages 12 and 13 of our press release package.Now I will briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments for the full year. Our regulated utility business USFE&G had a strong year contributing approximately 84% of our consolidated adjusted earnings. This segment delivered results consistent with our expectations despite unfavorable levels during the year.USFE&G\u2019s results include six months of earnings from progress utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida contributing a $1.02 per share before dilution. Top line revenue growth was also a significant driver due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas. New rates which included recovery of our major generation investments contributed $0.48 during the year.Revenue growth due to rate case activity is expected to be a continuing same over the next few years as we have a number of rate cases pending or are expected to be filed shortly. We maintained our focus on O&M cost taking advantage of opportunities to reduce spending in our fossil fleet due to lower capacity factors. This helps mitigate the impact of extended nuclear outages and emerging nuclear cost which occur in the fourth quarter.As a result excluding O&M expenses from progresses regulated operations, our O&M spend for the year at F&G was fairly consistent with the prior year. Turning now to our international operations as expected results for DEI in 2012 were lower than 2011, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In 2012 DEI contributed around 18% of our consolidated earnings.Even the lower than the prior year DEIs results for 2012 came in above our expectations principally due to favorable results at National Methanol and in Peru.Next I\u2019ll move on to our commercial power segment which includes our non-regulated generation in the mid-west, our renewables business and Duke Energy Retail. We expected commercial power results in 2012 to be below what we experienced in 2011. Our new electric security plant in Ohio which reset customer rates to lower market based rates become effective at the beginning of 2012. Lower PGM capacity revenues in our mid-west gas fleet and lower margins at Duke Energy Retail also negatively impacted results in the commercial power segment. Commercial power contributed less than 5% of our consolidated earnings in 2012. Our Midwest gas fired fleet continued to benefit from the low natural gas price environment. This fleet achieved record volumes a total generation during the year was about 17 million megawatt hours, around 40% higher than 2011 our previous annual record.Moving on to other, goods category had higher net expense from the prior year due to additional interest expense on Duke Energy Holding company debt as well as $0.12 from additional interest expense from the Progress Energy Holding following the merger.Others net expense was lower than we expected for the year and these results were principally due to lower losses at our captive insurance entity and favorable interest rate. We also recognized dilatation of a $1 per share for the year resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the Progress merger. As a reminder, we issued around 258 million shares to former holders of Progress Energy common stock. We now have around 705 million shares of Duke Energy outstanding. Note that all of these shares were not issued in outstanding for the entire year. Therefore, our weighted average number of shares outstanding for full year 2012 is 575 million.Now, I\u2019ll move on to a discussion of our customer volume trends and the economic conditions in our service territory. Slide 13 presents our quarter-over-quarter weather normalized customer usage trends as well as what we experienced for the full year in our regulated business. As a reminder, this chart includes trends for the Progress Energy utilities for 2012 compared to what was experienced in 2011.During 2012, our overall load growth excluding the impacts of weather was 0.6% higher consistent with our expectations. This growth was principally supported by industrial usage which was up around 1%. The automotive sector was especially strong in the Duke Energy Carolinas and Indiana service territories. U.S. auto sales for \u201812 reached their highest level in five years. Demand from our commercial customers increased approximately 0.7% primarily resulting from stronger retail sales. Residential demand was essentially flat for the year. Even though we experienced modest growth of around 0.7% in our average number of residential customers during the year, we continue to see the impact of the economic environment and energy efficiency and customer usage patterns.As we look ahead our diverse service territories provides you with a key advantage, our rates of generally below regional and national averages making our territories attractive for industrial and commercial expansion. We are also well positioned for a rebound in the residential market as housing markets improved. The trend in customer growth in our service territories was stronger in 2012 than in previous years.I will close with slide 14 which addresses our main financial objectives. We ended 2012 with adjusted EPS of $4.32 toward the upper end of our annual guidance range. As we look ahead to 2012, we have a number of important regulatory proceedings that will impact our results. We have recently announced the retirement of Crystal River 3. We are also addressing the merging cost in our nuclear business while aggressively pursuing our merger savings initiative.Our commercial business will also be impacted by the low point of PJM capacity prices and we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the unfavorable hydrology in Brazil. Many of you have looked at these items and turns 2013 a transitional year for Duke. We believe that 2013 is an important foundational year for the company and the appropriate base for future earnings growth. When we consider the degree of variability from timing and amount of regulatory outcomes and the items I just mentioned, we are planning for 2013 adjusted earnings per share to be reasonably consistent with our 2012 results, and we\u2019ll introduce the range on February 28 that addresses the regulatory variability. We are looking forward to providing more perspective on 2013 and beyond later this month.Growth in our long-term earnings per share and continued growth in our dividends remains central essential to our investor value proposition. We are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.4% remains attractive as compared to the 2% for the S&P 500. The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity, and credit metrics support our ability to grow the business as well as the dividend. We remain committed to maintaining that strength, which allows us to finance our growth in a cost effective manner directly benefiting our customers.In summary, I am pleased with our financial performance on how we have continued to consistently achieve our financial objectives. We have a strong growth platform as efficiency to the merger allow us to pass along savings to our customers and our shareholders. From a financial perspective, we remain well positioned for the future.Now, let me turn the call back over to Jim for his closing comments.Jim Rogers","Thanks Lynn. After a successful transformative 2012, we look forward to the future. We will discuss our plans as Lynn said for 2013 and beyond at our Analyst Meeting in New York on February 28.With that, let\u2019s open up the phone lines for your questions.Question-and-Answer Session","OperatorThank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). We will hear first from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.Dan Eggers - Credit SuisseI know you\u2019re going to talk about I have lot of these issues at your analyst day maybe I will ask couple of policy questions, can you maybe Jim share your thoughts on what\u2019s going on the Sutton in North Carolina kind of the trajectory of that legislation and you know what you think can might happen to the commission if there is momentum behind it.Jim RogersGiven that Duke and our customers are impacted by many of these state boards and commissions and our company has committed to working constructively with all of them is not appropriate for us to comment on this bill. We cannot speculate on the probability of the proposed legislation passing. Nonetheless we\u2019re focused on achieving the benefits of the merger for our customers in the Carolinas.Dan Eggers - Credit SuisseJim can you talk a little bit of the state of the union last night and President\u2019s comments on global warming type of legislations or rule making. How do you based on what you know, how do you guys see this playing through from an EPA perspective if they can\u2019t get legislative support and is that going to affect any investment decision you guys are looking at making from a coal plant remediation perspective?Jim RogersWe\u2019re continued to digest what President said and how people are interpreting it but the way I interpret it is as I couple it what he said in his inaugural address, it's clear that climate is going to be an important issue for him to address, of course you got many other important issues in terms of getting a budget, dealing with immigration of variety of other issues but I do think this is one of the front burner issues. I continue to believe that the EPA is not equipped to put a price and carve it. That is going to take legislation. I think there are many things that we can do to reduce our CO2 emissions, one thing the administration is already done is raise the CAP A standards and that will have an impact but I think the technology innovation of shell gas has been transformed even in terms of the carbon footprint of our industry. Today in the United States we\u2019re at the same place in terms of CO2 emissions as we were in 1992 and our per capita basis is the same place we were in 1960.I say that to say we made tremendous progress at reducing the burn of coal and have increased dramatically the burn of natural gas which has about 50% of the carbon footprint uphold. And so we have already made huge progress and I would say it another way we\u2019re on track to hit the maximum mark key 2020 number just based on the reduction and the emissions that we see as a consequence of burning base load gas and so I think much is being done to reduce carbon but at the end of the day they will have to put a price on carbon that can\u2019t be done by the EPA that can only be done by Congress and they need to act.And the good news is because we have the prices of solar dropping, the gas prices is at 3.50 at mmbtu and projected to stay in the 3 to 4, 4.5 - 5 range. We\u2019re in a period where you could start with a low price on carbon and led it escalate over a much longer period of time thus minimizing the impact on the economy. So I would say again there are a lot of ways to be thinking about this, I think the technological innovation has made a difference. I think other innovations and technologies are evolving, it's going to reduce our carbon footprint of the existing buildings in our country. So I think that we\u2019re on the road to decarbonizing our economy even without legislation but having a price on carbon would be important for the future to drive even further our successes that we have achieved so far.Dan Eggers - Credit SuisseAnd Jim I guess you said about $5 billion of environmental CapEx still to go, is that number perspectival your under review or the places where you put that money under reviewSri 9you are under review or the places where you put that money under review, you are based on the greater attention on CO2 policy?Jim RogersI think virtually all that is really placed on tighter regulations with respect to ash ponds, with respect to the air and SOx, NOx, mercury and primarily mercury. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of all of those. I don\u2019t think we have in that number anything that really goes to additional regulations on carbon. However, as we\u2019ve seen if the modernization that we just undertook dramatically reduces our carbon intensity of every kilowatt hour that we deliver on a blended basis. So, more to come on that, but the consequence of our modernization program that put us in some perspective in terms of the risk going forward, because it\u2019s going to allow us to retire almost 7000 megawatts of own coal plants. And that\u2019s almost 50 units that will be retired and we replace with a more efficient coal and more efficient gas plants. And that translates into lower emissions and lower cost on the margin for our customers. So, I think we have looked around the corner. Our modernization plan is ahead of most utilities in the country. If you look at Southern today, they are just now starting down the road of modernization of their generation fleet. So, I think we have already at the point of putting it behind this and being well positioned for the future.Dan Eggers - Credit SuisseOkay, got it. We\u2019ll see you at the Analyst Day. Thanks.Jim RogersThank you.OperatorAnd now we\u2019ll hear from Kit Konolige with BGC.Kit Konolige - BGCGood morning guys. Just a couple of questions. Can you kind of just update us on where we stand with the capacity filing in Ohio and when you referred to I think you gave us some guidance on that when do we expect that to be completed? And when you referred to it informing you\u2019re thinking on strategic direction, can you give us a little any further color on what\u2019s implied by that?Lynn GoodSo, it has the procedural schedule for the cost base capacity filing includes hearings in early April. So, there are testimony filings on our part as all of the interviewers and staff between now and early April, but that\u2019s the procedural schedule. You may recall that we undertook a strategic review of these assets back in 2012 and put that strategic review on hold as we began pursue to the cost based capacity filling. And so we will evaluate and continue to pursue to the cost-based capacity filing and believe that we fit those staff and circumstances well within the State of Ohio, and we\u2019ll work through that process and not take up another strategic review of the assets until that is complete.Kit Konolige - BGCVery good. And one other question on the North Carolina case, you filed for 11.25 ROE, what did you earn in 2012 in North Carolina?Lynn GoodKit, we will have some perspective on earned returns on Analyst Day in February, but I would think about it in the range of maybe 10%.Kit Konolige - BGCVery good. Okay, thank you.Lynn Good","Thank you.Jim RogersThank you.OperatorWe\u2019ll now take a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Really one question for Jim, one for Lynn.Jim RogersGood morning.Michael Lapides - Goldman SachsGood morning guys. When you think about Latin America and where it fits into the broader Duke puzzle or the pieces that makeup consolidated the new Duke Energy, how do you think about potential ways to either a) monetize the cash that\u2019s in Latin America or b) monetize the business overall?Lynn GoodMichael, I will take the comment on cash and cash flow. We are continuing to look for opportunities to bring home international cash. We took advantage of the tax holiday in the earlier part of the decade. We have looked at structuring techniques that could be helpful and the option of outright repatriation also remains and we continued to evaluate that in the context of the likelihood of broader tax reform and other matters. So I would think about that as a strategic option that\u2019s always available for the company. In terms of bringing partners into the business or outright selling the business, we\u2019re not focused on that at this point. We continue to look at optimizing the value of what we own and supplementing that value with appropriate acquisitions that\u2019s at our risk profile and our primary strategic focus is on integration of the companies and ensuring that we\u2019re properly situated the franchise electric and gas business for a success in the future.Michael Lapides - Goldman SachsOne follow-up, when Lynn you made the comment about 2013 and 2012 being kind of reasonable with each other from an earnings perspective you have got a lot rate actions underway in 2013 many of which you know they are not going into effect in 2013 many or mid-year later. Would you make a comment like that, what are you assuming in terms of any uplift at all on the revenue line related to those rate actions whether it's Ohio electric and gas, whether it's the two cases in North Carolina or the ones you\u2019re going to file in South Carolina.Lynn GoodMichael we will be making assumptions on the partial year effect of all these rate proceedings and that degree of variability will be something that we will contemplate as we establish a range or expectations in 2013 and we will give you a fuller report on that and anxious to do that at the end of February.Michael Lapides - Goldman SachsGot it. Last question, pension, we have had a lot of companies talk about pension as a headwind, others talk about it as a requirement for cash contributions just thoughts.Lynn GoodThe economics of pension Michael are a headwind right? Discount rates is down a 100 basis points for Duke between 12 and 13. So we\u2019re looking at the composition of benefits expenses and the broader context of the merger and have a number of other plans considerations that we\u2019ll be implementing. So we will have an opportunity to give you an update on the specific impact to 2013 when we talk about guidance later this month.OperatorWe\u2019ll move to a question from Andy Bishop with Morningstar Financial Services.Andy Bishop - Morningstar Financial ServicesI know you highlighted it's little bit a newly first week but can you provide a little more color on both short term and long term plans for replacing your loss generation from Crystal River.Jim Rogers","Sure. The bottom-line is we retired Crystal River 3 and we look out in the future, we see that Crystal River 1 and 2 will be retired between \u201915 - 2017 timeframe. So when you think about those retirements in a collective way it's clear that we need additional capacity and my judgment is it gas price combined cycle plants is the best capacity. We are dependent on natural gas in a significant way but if you look at the studies on the projection and the price of natural gas the cost to produce shell gas in United States I think there is going to be adequate supply over a long period of time and people are talking in a range of the price because of the supply will be in the $4 to $5 range over a very long period of time and that means like a decade or two.Now I will quickly caveat that in almost 40 years in the industry I have never seen an energy forecast that was right. So, but I do believe that we\u2019re all surprised at the amount of reserves that we have found of shell gas and surprised at the low cost of production and so we believe that building gas in Florida even though we\u2019re significantly dependent on gas is still a good thing to do going forward.Operator(Operator Instructions). And now we\u2019ll hear from Ashar Khan with Visium.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumJust going forward Jim could you just bring us a little up-to-date on the board additions and the process for the change, search for the CEO going forward as you look into the latter half of the year?","Jim Rogers","Sure. The board is working to add a new director in the first half of this year and another director by the end of the year. And they have engaged a consultant to work with them to be able to bring a new director or two new directors on board. They are going. The Board Committee is working through a very thoughtful deliberate process in the selection of a new CEO to lead our company going forward. And my judgment is, let\u2019s say, are on track to get this done in a timely way and more to come on all of that and as their deliberations are ongoing.Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. And if I can just get some when you mean by timely way is something expected in the summer is that where one should look forward to?Jim RogersI can\u2019t predict how the deliberations will unfold. I am in a position that we are on advising the board and advising the consulting group in terms of how to think about it defining what the way the requirements of the CEO should be given where our industry and where our company is relative to other participants in our industry. But I think again they are going to very thoughtful, very deliberative, because this is the most important decision a board ever makes. And that\u2019s selecting who the CEO is. And I think they are going to do it in a careful way and they will take as much time as needed to get it done.Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. Again, thanks a lot and thanks again on a very, very successful year.","Jim RogersThank you.Operator(Operator Instructions) We will hear from Michael Lapides with a follow-up from Goldman Sachs.Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hi, Jim. I know you don\u2019t want to comment on the North Carolina legislation, but just in terms of the rate case processes in general and when there is turnover voluntary, involuntary regardless of commissioners, what are the rules in North Carolina when if there is ever turnover of the commissioner or multiple commissioners in the middle of a rate case. Different states have different rules, we occasionally see commissioners move on to other jobs, we see them retire or at least for health reasons, just trying to understand what the rules in the Carolinas are regarding whether you need a quorum of commissioners or something along that line to formally rule on an ongoing rate case?Jim RogersWell, first I will start my comment by saying it\u2019s really premature to comment on the impact it will have on our rate case filings, because no legislation has been passed yet. And the other point I would make is that I am confident that regardless of how Senate Bill turns out it will be done in a way that provides for a careful transition and under the rules of the state we are allowed to put our rates into effect. I think mid-year with respect to PEC and with six months after we filed with DEC, so it\u2019s like a six-month rule. So, we can put the rates into effect. And we are working with the public staff and get resolution of this and we are working to resolve this through settlement and always -- our first choice is always to resolve rate cases through settlement and if we can do that, that will be terrific, but more to come on all that.Michael Lapides - Goldman SachsGot it. Okay. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciate it.OperatorAnd at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I will go ahead and turn the call over to Jim Rogers for any additional or closing remarks.Jim RogersThank you again for being on our call today. Thanks for your interest and investment in Duke. I\u2019m pleased with the momentum we have created in a short period, it's a new Duke Energy, a merger will enable us to put the company in a strong position for the future and realize efficiencies that benefit of customers and investors. We look forward to seeing those of you who will be at our analyst meeting on the 28th of this month. Thank you all very much.Operator","Thank you sir. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Yolanda. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's first quarter 2016 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide three, Lynn will cover our first quarter financial and operational highlights and provide an update of our recent strategic and growth initiatives. Then Steve will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, an, update on economic activities within our service territories and close with our key investor considerations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment. First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on slide four.","This morning we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our regulated utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, milder weather and weaker than expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth and our 12-month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations.","Operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognized tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a movement. As we've looked at the balance of the year, we are affirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. That commitment starts with our focus on safety.","For 2015, Duke Energy's employees safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognize by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor, building on its record breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever.","Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment, taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal-to-gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005.","Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, Winter Storm Jonas struck the Carolinas causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect.","Next let me update you on our coal ash basin closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress with closure activities underway at six sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is required by statue to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classifications shortly.","The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closure methods which include storing the ash in place. W are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment, while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance.","Turning to slide five. I'll highlight several recent milestones in our important growth initiatives. Our five-year capital plan through 2020 includes a deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital in new natural gas-fired generation, grid investment, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure.","These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid, as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system. These investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable, long-term growth in earnings and the dividend.","During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Ashville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville Coal Plant by 2020 and replacing it with two highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units.","In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee Natural Gas Combined Cycle Plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 in-service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas-fired Citrus County Combined Cycle Plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date.","We're building on our success and growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our commercial portfolio, our two 200-megawatt wind projects, Los Vientos IV and Frontier are on target to come online later this year.","Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of nine new solar projects including eight in North Carolina. In our regulated utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned solar installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida, and Indiana. That's already about 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, as pictured on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.","In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced a settlement agreement with nearly all interveners including key consumer groups on our seven-year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information, and overall energy savings.","In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around mid-year.","Our two commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February, and the pipeline is on target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the lengths of the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative routes as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests.","We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning. The project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed. And as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt of the FERC certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 in-service date for the project.","Turning to slide six, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio toward regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The two strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses that drive more stable earnings and cash flows.","Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control upon acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval is with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearing for July 18. We remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year.","Additionally, at the end of February, we successfully priced a common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time the Piedmont transaction closes.","We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets including signing nondisclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high quality assets, which we believe will attract significant interest for potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition.","In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business with stable, transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016.","Now, let me turn it over to Steve.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Lynn. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bill Currens for his seven years as a leader with the Investor Relations team. Bill's tireless commitment to delivering accurate, transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding. I will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Controller.","As many of you know, Mike Callahan is succeeding Bill as Vice President of Investor Relations. Currently Mike serves as Director of Regulated Utilities Forecasting. He has also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team, where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors.","Today, I'll focus on four primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, and then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations.","Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide seven. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release.","First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015.","Additionally in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international. On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments.","On an adjusted basis, regulated utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing and riders in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service, including the acquisition of the NCEMPA assets in July 2015.","Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm cost in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our commercial portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of the Midwest generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter.","Moving to international operational performance, in particular in Brazil, strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in southeast Brazil are approximately 60%, compared to around 30% this time last year. This improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchased power costs to meet our contractual commitments.","We also had $0.11 of favorable tax related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events. You will recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the US. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the international business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our US income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the international business, we will recognize additional US income taxes for international up until the point of sale. Overall, and with our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share.","Moving onto slide eight, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail load growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives.","Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow, to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1% respectively over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector, as many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures.","As for the industrial sector, construction, automotives and textiles continue to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies that compete globally, such as steel and metals. Our 12-month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions, despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year.","Moving to slide nine, as we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organization. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable to the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes and systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We also continued to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas.","Also within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we're making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the Nuclear Promise is an industry-wide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out cost and place more discipline on capital allocation.","In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs.","I'll close with slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the international business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend.","Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources. We're excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers.","Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We are only one quarter into the year, but remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. Greg, I think we've got you first in the queue. We'll go to Greg Gordon. Greg? Operator, if you can hear us, we'll go ahead and take Q&A now.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We appear that we having some technical difficulty. So, we'll wait for a few minutes to see if we can establish the line for questions.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","If everyone could just bear with us for one second. They had a fire alarm over at the operator's location. So just bear with us for a second here.","Operator","We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Thanks. Bill, first of all I wanted to say congratulations. You've run a fantastic IR program. You're leaving it in great hands as well.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you for that comment Greg.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Good morning. How are you? So, couple of questions on tax. So you're ahead of the game on tax and international. I was a little bit distracted when you were going through that part of your script, so can you rehash what's going on there? And does that effectively put you ahead of target for the year for that segment, since you're already more than halfway there in the first quarter on your targeted guidance assumptions? Or is the tax drag year-over-year from other parts of the business offsetting it? And finally, you're at a 26% effective tax rate year-to-date. Are you still expecting it to be 32%, 33% levelized over the course of the year, or is that also trending better?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So Greg, let me start with a little explanation on the tax adjustment, then I'll turn it to Steve on specifics around effective tax rate. So coming into this year, we had the extension of bonus depreciation and then the planned announcement of the exit of international, put us in a position where we could relook at the tax consequences of the sale of the business and we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflecting in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense, because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year. So, ahead of plan through the first quarter, good economic benefit from the tax planning that the team has accomplished here, and I'll turn it to Steve to talk about effective tax rate.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, we had expected and forecasted an effective tax rate for the year of about 32% to 33%. I think it will be lower than that. You might lower it by 1% on that range, as a result of the tax strategies we put forth related to international.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So some portion of that $0.11 will flow back, but there will be a net benefit when we look back at the end of the fiscal year. Is that a fair summary?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that's true.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. A modest amount will turn, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. I think I understand. Thank you, guys. I'll cede to the next question.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, guys. That was actually going to be my first question. So, I'll ask my second one which was on the international sale. Can you give any insight at this stage whether you feel it's more likely the assets get sold in one block or in packages or some other structure?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jonathan, we're pleased with where we are on the process. There's been good market interest in the assets. We're still in preliminary phases. So, I can't speak to whether or not the transaction will be a single transaction or a combination. Our objective will be to optimize the value of the portfolio. And as the year progresses, we'll keep you informed on timing and expectations. But I would say we're off to a solid start on the process.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Are you committed to exiting everything, or is it possible that there would be a partial sale if that was the better value outcome?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've made a decision to exit, and are certainly in that process today, Jonathan, and as we move through it we'll have a better sense of timing and approach. So, I think that's a question that we'll be prepared to give more specifics on as the year progresses. But again, we're off to a good start with the degree of market interest we're seeing in the assets.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. And thank you to you as well Bill. And good luck.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jonathan.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for that peaceful moment there earlier.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We didn't know what was going on for awhile.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I know, when we figured out it was a fire alarm, it has to be one of the first ever. Mr. Currens (32:20) on his final call.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. So, we'll always remember your final call, Bill. So, just one other clarification on the international. There were Bloomberg Radio story headlines this morning that seemed to imply there was a comment from that saying that the dilution from the sale would be less than you had thought going forward. That's not what you said though here in this call. So, could you just clarify, did you say something about that or is there anything to add there?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, thanks for that question. So it's kind of all a part of this discussion around economic value from this tax adjustment. So, we still intend, believe the transaction will be dilutive. We'll give more visibility on valuation as the process continues. But the fact that we've had a tax planning strategy here that has provided an economic value reflected in the first quarter is significant. It's a combination of bonus and the decision to sell. So that was the point I was making. But we'll know more on the valuation of the entire transaction as the year progresses.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But there just to, I'm sorry to clarify again. So you were referring to the benefit that you got in this first quarter. There is not some other tax benefits that occur post sale that we weren't.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just maybe on the clarifying kind of going back to last call. So you had said before, the 4% to 6% growth rate and it's going to be kind of maybe kind of lower toward the beginning of the period, then rising toward the end of the period. Is that still kind of the way you look at it?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We don't expect linear, just given the timing of our capital deployment, the approach we take toward rate cases and resetting our prices. But over the five-year period, we believe we have the capital investments, the growth initiatives that will drive growth within our 4% to 6% targeted range.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then lastly, I think Piedmont has a stake in the Constitution Pipeline. I mean, I'm sure that's not a huge part of the company, but just does that affect much at all your kind of expectations there, the delay?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we've been following that closely. Steve, and of course are disappointed in the ruling in the State of New York. I think the partners in the projects have been very clear on where they are and the fact that they are reviewing a number of options to go forward. At this point, we're planning for a delay in the project. But as these options are pursued, some of which could include resubmission or appeal through the courts, we'll have a better sense of timing and outcome, so more to come on that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And their stake is like $250 million, is that the right number?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Around $200 million. Around $200 million, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julien.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Get it started. So, a few clarifying questions here. Following up on Steve's last question, how do you think about hitting the bottom end of the range through at least the near-term period? Just to kind of clarify that. Do you expect to be able to hit that 4% in the subsequent years, especially given the year-to-date start and where the sales process is et cetera?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Julien, I think our guidance on that is as it was at the end of the year. We have reaffirmed our range of $4.50 to $4.70 for this year. We're in the midst of portfolio transition with the sale of international and the acquisition of Piedmont, both of which we expect to make substantial progress on in 2016. That will have bearing on 2017 and forward, so we'll give you a better sense of 2017 as we get close. We're confident in the range. We believe it will be nonlinear, as we've talked about, but don't have anything further to say on that at this point. But we're working hard on all elements of both growth initiatives, capital deployment, pursuing rate cases at the right time, and moving aggressively through the transition in the portfolio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And then a quick follow-up on pension accounting here. We've seen some companies in the sector pursue some new policies on discount rates. I'd be curious, is that something you all are reviewing?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We keep abreast of the various accounting rules and options available to us and those are things that we look at with a regular basis and we're keeping an eye on those things. We're aware of the different methods of selecting discount rates, yield curves, bond methods, spot methods, so we're keeping an eye on that.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just no decisions at this point. Julien. Those decisions will be finalized in connection with our year-end planning process.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, would that still affect potentially this year?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no decisions have been made at this point.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No decisions, and typically a decision like that would impact prospective years.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, more strategic question here. As you think about the gas expansion that you are undertaking by the acquisition of Piedmont, how are you thinking about future expansions or exposures on the gas side of the equation? And specifically here, either more gas utilities or more importantly, I suppose the more direct midstream pipeline exposure. I'd be curious.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, we're excited about what the potential of the Piedmont acquisition represents for Duke and our focus here in 2016 is on closing the transaction and also progressing Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We also see growth within the Piedmont franchise, both with customer additions as well as infrastructure that would support gas generation here in the Carolinas. So, we expect to continue to build on that platform in particular. We'll look at assets that make sense for Duke, whether they're midstream or local distribution companies, but don't have anything more specific to share with you at this point. We're focused on closing the transaction and integrating it in a successful way.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I had a more specific question on timing for the international sale. I do respect that it's still relatively early in the process, but it's my understanding that you really got the ball rolling back in January, so it's been a couple months now. At least you do have those I guess confidentiality agreements in place, and you are in discussions. Maybe it would be helpful to hear a best case scenario here knowing what you know, in terms of timing for the ultimate close of the transaction.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And you know, Chris, the ball was rolling in January and February on planning. The ball began rolling into the market with discussions with counterparties on non-disclosure agreements and interest more in the late March, April timeframe. And so we are two months into that process. The data room, the data book is in the hands of prospective buyers, and over the next couple of months, we'll be learning more about degree of interest, number of parties that intend to stay in the process, and we'll have more to update in the second quarter.","I just you know, given where we are, I don't have any more specifics to share with you. Jonathan I believe or someone asked earlier about, is it one transaction or multiple. That of course would impact timing. Our objective is to optimize the value of the portfolio, and we're going to move through this in a thoughtful way to accomplish exactly that. And we'll give you more specifics when we are further into the process.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then my second question is on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We did have the delay in the start of construction I guess that you gave some color on in your prepared remarks, but the overall cost and completion date remains unchanged. Is there any more information that you can give us there in terms of the drivers of that delay and start of construction and maybe moving pieces within the lack of change of completion date and lack of change of total costs that might have kind of netted to no effect there, I guess.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Chris, there has been a very active engagement on the part of the partners throughout this process and the delay in receipt of FERC approval has really been the result of pursuing alternate routes and addressing environmental and stakeholder concerns along the way. So the schedule, as originally developed, had contingency timing in it which we've continued to work actively with our partners, including you know the way we're engaging with contractors. And at this point believe that we are on target for a mid-2017 approval from FERC, which should give us an ability to continue to target late 2018 for in-service. So, a lot of good work has been going on to look at a variety of alternatives and to work with the contingency that was within the original project plan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Couple of easy ones. Can you all talk about how much utility O&M was down year-over-year in the quarter excluding the impact of storms?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Michael. The O&M, the non-recoverable types O&M was down $0.04 year-over-year in the quarter. And again, we had about $0.05 of storms delta quarter-over-quarter offsetting that. But we had the $0.04 benefit.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then CapEx in the quarter came in, like if I just annualize that number, that would imply a year-end number several billion below kind of what you highlighted for 2016 levels. Should we just assume CapEx is very back-end loaded in the course of this year or is there a kind of downside potential to that CapEx number?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think our original capital plans for the years are still intact. I think it's just a shaping during the year.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Michael, if you look back even at 2015, we spent about 20% of capital last year. We're kind of in that range this year in the first quarter, and then it picks up over the course of the year. So the pattern looks similar to what we've experienced in previous years.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then finally, can you just remind us what are your thoughts or plans around rate case timing across the various utilities or across your system?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Michael. As we had mentioned in the February call, we're looking at the majority of these cases to be back loaded in the five-year timeframe. But that's always subject to scrutiny of costs and events that are going on at the time. And in fact, we are looking at accelerating a rate case. We may file a notice this year for our filing for Duke Energy Progress South Carolina jurisdiction. So we're always looking at what's the appropriate time to go in, what's our cost structure look like and the investment timing related to that. I'd still say that the majority of the cases are in the back end of the five-year timeframe. But the South Carolina is an example of an opportunity we have that we need to move on perhaps earlier.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Yeah. I asked that question only because if I look at the quarterly demand rather than the rolling 12 months, while it's really strong in the Carolinas, Florida has been a little bit weaker and Indiana and Ohio especially in this quarter were significantly weak on a weather normalized basis.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, the rate case timing in Florida, you may recall, we have the GBRAs in place in connection with the building of the plants and that along with that, has a stay-out through 2018, I believe. And then in Indiana, we've been pursuing the T-disc, the grid investment, which will give us an ability to track and that will in hearing hopeful to get approval in Indiana, which will give us an opportunity to reset prices for those investments. And we'll continue to monitor whether load trends and other things would change our timing in Indiana, but we believe the tracker that we're pursuing is the highest priority rate activity in that jurisdiction.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I am all set. Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","We'll move to our next caller then, Praful Mehta with Citi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So, my quick question was, you mentioned on growth on the gas side that you might look at other gas assets. So just to clarify, are you talking about building on your platform for gas with acquisitions or are you looking for organic growth to build on your gas platform?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The first objective is to close the sale, or close the purchase of Piedmont Natural Gas. And we believe that we'll have organic growth opportunities within that platform not only for new customer additions but expansion of the interstate pipeline system in the Carolinas as we continue our strategic move from coal to gas. And then beyond that, for midstream or LDCs, there was a question earlier that address our interest in that. We will consider those types of additions to the portfolio that make sense, complement what we're trying to do. But our primary objective is closing the transaction, focusing our attention on integration, focusing our attention on growth organically as I outlined, and then other opportunities we'll evaluate as they arise.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys. That's all I have.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello. Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello Ali.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Can you remind us for this year, the commercial power earnings that you've budgeted, how much of that is essentially coming from recognition of tax credits? Is it almost all of it?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you look in the slide deck, Ali, on slide 13, it gives you the full year assumption for commercial, and that business is commercial wind and solar, which as you know have tax credits as an important part of their economics. So, that gives you a range or a perspective on the magnitude of that contribution.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And Lynn, what is the mix between ITC and PTC recognition there?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","More heavily PTC, just because of the nature of our portfolio, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And what's current the average life of contracts on the PTC side?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the PTC side, we look at PPAs that are in the range of typically 15 to 25 years, in that type of range.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the PTC benefit, Ali, as you know is a 10-year benefit.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And you are relatively early in that recognition, right, for most of the portfolio?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, certainly, we've been in the business, started modestly in 2007 and then you can look at our kind of capital contribution in growth 2012, 2013, 2014, so I would say early in that PTC period generally.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And lastly, Lynn, I know when you provide us full-year guidance, you lay out what you're expecting adjusted ROEs to be across the portfolio as well. And in general, I mean would you say is there much in terms of, because looking at those numbers, it doesn't seem to be, but is there much in terms of regulatory lag that you would say exists in your portfolio that perhaps can be captured in future years or are you thinking generally speaking the ROEs will move when you file those rate cases in the back end of the five-year forecast?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me make a comment and then Steve can continue. Steve commented a moment ago, Ali, that we see the potential for rate cases in South Carolina in 2016 that's consistent with capital spending and cost structure and earned returns. And so we do have rate case potential in South Carolina in the very near term. And then later in the five-year period in North Carolina, that will be the result of regulatory lag showing up on capital investment that is occurring now and will occur into the future. I commented on trackers in Indiana and Florida, but at some point, we'll address updating those rates as well. So, I think regulatory lag for any jurisdiction where we have historic test periods or the need to use base rate increases to achieve prices is going to have some regulatory lag associated with it. And that's the careful analysis that we closely watch in determining the timing for filing.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I would add, as we said in February, we had a slide on our five-year growth and we showed the lag was about 3% negative. And that's an average number over the five-year period. It will vary year per year. And it is as Lynn said related to the jurisdictions where you've got gaps between rate cases and you build up investments during those gap periods. So, we're working on that and planning around those events.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Congratulations again, Bill.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to just sort of touch base on the storms. Is there a normal number for storm costs that we should be thinking about in this quarter?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is hard to predict storms obviously. The past three years we've seen winter storms that have hit us in the range of $50 million or $60 million a year, but whether that's normal or not, I would hesitate to say. We try to impute an amount that we think about in our budgeting, but you'll have during the summer season the potentials for hurricanes in the Southeast and then in the winter storms across our jurisdictions other than Florida, typically there's the potential. there. Hard to predict, but we've seen winter storms the past three years in the neighborhood of $50 million or $60 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. On slide 19, it looks like you guys are indicating that for the utilities, only about $0.01 was impacted by unfavorable weather. And I mean, is that solely because of it seems \u2013 it's a little surprisingly, it seems a little low. Does that take into account storm outages that might lower customer usage or, because when we look at slide eight, it looks like non-weather adjusted sales were down 4%, and I think that does not include leap year, correct?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. Yes. Let me give a little color on this. But typically, outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly, as one point to make there, when you're looking at the whole breadth of things. I would say that the, I always want to say this, when you're looking at a quarter in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March, and I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter of 2015 was very, very cold. And I don't know whether all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well.","So you're comparing these two weather normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess at what that could be. So we just roll with the data. I like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically there. We did as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think the 12-month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting. And I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that. That's part of our long-term plans.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know Paul, the only thing I would add to it is, we have standard methods of identifying what is weather related and non-weather related. And what Steve is commenting on is those standard methods can be impacted in periods where there is extreme temperature. So extreme cold or extreme warm weather that we experienced in March. So that all leads us to look at longer time periods, so that we don't have those anomalies that could exist in any quarter. And that is really what has led us to this 12-month rolling average discussion on load because we think that is more indicative of trends we're experiencing. And as you can imagine, we watch this really closely and manage the business for a low load growth environment.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andy.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","How you guys doing?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, sir.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","You're one of the best ever, even though you never won that award, okay. I just want to say that. I would have given you that award.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","You just gave it to us, so thank you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. But maybe next year Michael will win it, so. Actually I think most of my questions have been answered, but just back on the sales. So leap year is what, about 30 basis points on an annual basis, is that?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's roughly right, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right, so I guess for the quarter, you times up by four or something like that, or is that not the right math?","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah I think you could get in the ballpark there, and it's a little, that's a rough way to do it.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right.","Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But again, I think getting weather normalized data is as much art as science and when you get an extreme period like we had in March and comparing it to an extreme period like a prior year, I think you can get fluctuations that make that comparison a little distorted. We think our customer growth and volumes are in line with our broad prediction levels and we'll keep an eye on it.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","What do you guys think, I mean just in general, because it's not just you who are seeing like decent customer growth or weak sales trends and it's not just this quarter. Is it still energy efficiency or what else could it be?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing that we look at, Andy, is multifamily housing versus single family homes. We're starting to see some positive trends in the Carolinas where there are more single family home construction opportunities. But coming out of the economic downturn, a lot of the growth was in multifamily units, which by their footprint use less energy than a home. So, I think we're closely monitoring this and the call to the action for us is to ensure that our cost structure and the way we manage our investments and assets are consistent with the trends we're seeing at the top line. And we believe we have a demonstrated track record in managing our business that way.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Yeah. And then, just in general I guess, international is doing better than expected. Part of that is the tax benefit; part of that is hydro and then I would assume for the second half of the year, you'll have some tailwind from currency if things kind of stay where they are. So that's a positive for this year. But it also seems that the utility itself, because of the sales trends and I guess lack of rate increases, seems to be towards the low end of your range at this point. Again, it's early in the year, but is that a fair statement?","Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Andy, we're on target for the range of $450 million to $470 million that we talked to you about. This is the first quarter. I think to give you any more specifics on placement within the guidance range is just premature. As you know, the third quarter is our most significant quarter, and we're managing the business with identifying rate increase opportunities. Steve talked about South Carolina of course watching costs as part of that. And we'd like to see a longer trend on the sales growth to continue to monitor where that is progressing. So on track to achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Thank you very much, and Bill, again congratulations. I think you'll be a great Controller and keep everyone in the straight and narrow, because I guess that's what a Controller does, and I'm sure your kids will be happy to spend more time with you than they have for the last few years.","Bill Currens - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right.","Lynn J.

He will also provide an update on our regulatory and financing activities this year before closing with key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn Good","Mike, thank you and good morning everyone. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Our results to-date represents 6% growth over last year and give us confidence as we reaffirm our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth target of 4% to 6% through 2023.","With solid growth across all three operating segments, we are executing our long-term strategy to transform the customer experience and deliver value for our shareholders. Our investments in the energy grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure ensure Duke Energy is well-positioned to build a smarter, low carbon energy future. In addition, we remain committed to the dividend and for the 13th consecutive year, we increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders.","Shifting to operations, let me highlight several noteworthy accomplishments on slide four. First, Piedmont Natural Gas was recognized as one of America's most trusted brands among utilities, continuing to prove that franchise's value as well as its unwavering dedication to safety and impressive customer service. And we also remain steadfast in our focus on operational excellence. I am very proud of our employees' commitment to providing reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy to our customers every day. This was exemplified the strong performance of our system during the recent sustained heat wave. Our teams demonstrated exceptional preparation and collaboration across the company and the fleet performed well while serving near record loads in the Carolinas, the Midwest and Florida.","Turning to slide five, let me provide an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives to generate cleaner energy. In our electric business, the $1.1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project in Asheville remains on track. On August 5, the combined cycle plant successfully achieved first fire, an important milestone in the process to bring the unit online in late 2019. As a reminder, our comprehensive plan for this region includes retiring an older coal plant, building new natural gas combined cycle unit, installing renewables and upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure. We have also engaged the community to increase energy efficiency, demand response adoption and our products and services offerings as we better serve this growing region.","In Indiana, we filed our integrated resource plan and rate case in early July. Consistent with our cleaner generation strategy, key components of our plan include accelerating coal plant retirements and replacing them with natural gas units and renewables. Steve will discuss the elements of the rate case filing in more detail in a moment. We also continued to advance innovative solutions across the Southeast, including renewables, battery and EV infrastructure.","In Florida, we are executing on the investment plan that underpins our multiyear settlement agreement. The Florida Commission has approved the recovery of 344 megawatts of previously announced solar projects under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. This represents nearly half of the 700 megawatts we will be installing through 2021. We also announced 22 megawatts of battery storage projects in the state this quarter, kicking off the first wave of our planned 50 megawatts pilot program.","In the Carolinas, we continue to engage stakeholders in our proposed electric vehicle pilot program. Electrification is an important part of the low carbon future and we will forward to spurring EV adoption in our communities with this infrastructure. Also in North Carolina, the first RFP for solar energy under House Bill 589 is complete. The second RFP is expected to launch this October and we look forward to participating in the next round of bidding.","In our commercial business, we expanded our portfolio of projects during the quarter. In June, the 150 megawatts North Rosamond solar facility began delivering energy to customers in California. This is the largest solar project in our renewables fleet to-date and the energy generated from the project will be sold to Southern California Edison under a 15-year PPA.","We also announced 650 megawatts of new project this quarter including the acquisition of 37 megawatts of Bloom Energy's distributed fuel cell technology which will come online over the next 18 months. We continue to bring more visibility to our growth prospects in this segment and are evaluating a modest level of investment to safe harbor several solar projects preserving the full investment tax credits through our five-year plan. We now have line of sight to substantially all of our growth targets for 2019 and 2020 and approximately 70% over the five-year plan.","Shifting to our gas business on slide six. ACP Project Partners filed a petition on June 25 taking a Supreme Court review of the Appalachian Trail decision. We are pleased to have the Solicitor General join the petition in support of the case and we expect the court to decide later this fall if it will agree to hear the appeal. We also recently received an order from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacating the project's Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement. We are evaluating this order and will work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to resolve any deficiencies.","In anticipation of this ruling, work has been underway, including survey work to address certain issues identified at the May 9 hearing and confirmed in the excavation order. Our current expectation is that construction could resume by year-end, recognizing there are several steps that need to take place before we move forward. We continue to target in service for the first phase of the project by late 2020 and full pipeline in service in 2021. Our cost estimate of $7 billion to $7.8 billion remains unchanged.","Finally, we are moving ahead with the construction of our $250 million Robinson LNG facility in North Carolina. This infrastructure will help Piedmont continue providing customers with the most affordable and reliable supply of natural gas during peak usage days, protecting customers from price spikes and volatility when extremely low temperatures create higher than normal demand for natural gas. We expect this facility to be in service during 2021. Each of these project aligns with our strategy to expand natural gas infrastructure as we bring much needed gas supply to the underserved Southeast.","Moving to slide seven, let me share an overview of recent developments in North Carolina. Senate Bill 559 is pending before the North Carolina General Assembly. As a reminder, this bipartisan legislation was introduced in both chambers in early April. As written, it would allow the Commission to consider alternative cost recovery mechanisms including storm cost securitization, multiyear rate plans and ROE bands. Importantly, the Commission would retain its authority to review investments and the prudency of incurred costs just as it does today.","If enacted into law, North Carolina would join 35 states that already have alternative cost recovery frameworks in place which generates significant customer benefits and incents investments necessary to transform our energy infrastructure. A multiyear rate plan in North Carolina would provide bill predictability and through investments in the energy delivery system result in fewer and shorter outages for customers while enabling more solar and battery installations. Further, storm cost securitization would save customers 15% to 20% on storm costs. Stakeholders have provided useful inputs throughout the legislative process strengthening the Bill by creating additional consumer protection.","The current version of the Bill also provides for utility investments to support low income communities. The Bill, which is sponsored by the leading members of the House and Senate has passed the Senate and moved through three required House committees. The Bill currently remains in the Rules Committee of the House as the general assembly addresses other priorities, specifically the 2019 budget. The next step for the Bill is a vote by the Full House before moving to the Senate and ultimately the Governor for his consideration. Given there is no set end date for this session, we will monitor development and continue our advocacy work in support of the legislation. The Bill sponsors remain committed to Senate Bill 559 and the substantial benefits it offers to our customers and our state.","Shifting of coal ash, I am extraordinarily proud of the work underway to meet our commitments in North Carolina. We successfully closed all three high priority sites ahead of their 2019 compliance deadline despite hurricanes and other severe weather of the last few years. We are also advancing work at the remaining sites. The legal process to appeal the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's order to excavate all remaining low rent and low priority basins is also underway.","While we share the same goals of permanently and safely closing all basins, we disagree with the DEQ's position and filed an appeal in April outlining our case. Last week, the Office of Administrative Hearings heard arguments on a partial motion to dismiss filed by DEQ. The judge dismissed claims related to the procedure DEQ used in reaching a decision while allowing the substantive claim on the decision to excavate to move forward.","We plan to proceed with the appeal, standing firm that the DEQ decision is not in the best interest of our customers and communities. We estimate full excavation would cost an incremental $4 billion to $5 billion versus the cap in place or hybrid closure methods proposed by our utilities, imposing significant cost on customers without measurable benefit to the environment. We expect the appeal process could take nine to 12 months and we will keep you informed as we reach milestones during the process.","Before turning it over to Steve, I would want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term strategy and our continued ability to deliver on our commitments. As the past quarter shows, we are making strides improving the energy grid, transitioning our generation of fleet and increasing natural gas infrastructure. With significant investments in renewables, progress on regulatory and legislative front and ongoing stakeholder engagement, we are advancing our long-term vision for Duke Energy.","And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Steven Young","Thanks Lynn and good morning everyone. I will start with quarterly results on slide eight including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year. For detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.","On both a reported and adjusted basis, 2019 second quarter earnings per share were $1.12. This compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 and $0.93 respectively last year. For the quarter, higher reported and adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities, the commercial renewables project placed in service and favorable timing of O&M expenses.","Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.13 compared to the prior year. The segment continued to benefit from base rate increases across multiple utilities as well as higher rider revenues that include recovery of our Midwest grid investments. O&M was also favorable $0.07 in the quarter. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and higher interest expense.","Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.02 in the quarter. The increase was largely due to growth from our midstream investments. As a reminder, we expect the LDC businesses to deliver the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter.","In commercial renewables, results were up $0.06 driven primarily by our North Rosemont solar project placed in service. This was partially offset by below normal wind resource and a prior year favorable contractual settlement.","Finally, other contributed $0.01 for the quarter and share dilution drove a $0.03 decline, given we issued shares in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. Overall, we are pleased with our strong results for the first half of the year and our solid execution gives us confidence that will achieve our full-year earnings target and deliver on our commitments. For perspective on key considerations for the back half of the year, please see the slide we provided in the appendix.","Turning to slide nine. We operate in jurisdictions with strong customer growth and economy. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.5%, consistent with our full-year expectation. Our residential class continues to contribute to our results with an overall increase in volumes of 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis. Robust customer growth fueled by population increases in our attractive service territories support volumes.","Our jurisdictions also enjoy strong employment. Nearly 25% of all jobs created over the last year across the nation are in states we serve. We are also seeing strength in the commercial class with sales up 0.7% over the rolling 12-months. Data center expansions continue to lead growth in the sector with strength in the hospitality and leisure segments also helping to offset weakness in big-box retail.","Finally, sales in our industrial class declined 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis, a slight improvement from last quarter. As expected, results continue to be impacted by 2018 production declines for a few large customers and recent outage activities that continue to influence the 12-month rolling average. Going forward, we believe these specific outliers will continue to improve. At a macro level, economic indicators for our service areas remain strong and reaffirmed our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities.","Turning to slide 10, let me update you on our active regulatory calendar. In July, we filed our first Indiana rate case in 16 years. As Lynn mentioned, the case presents the road map to our cleaner generation strategy and also incorporates modern regulatory recovery mechanisms. These include forward-looking test years and a five-year decoupling program for residential and commercial customers. The requested $395 million revenue increase would occur over two years and is based on a 10.4% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure.","Key drivers of the request include additional depreciation as we accelerate retirement dates of our coal fleet in the state and investments to serve more than 100,000 customers added since the last rate case. We expect hearings for the case to commence in January 2020 with rates effective mid-2020.","Let me move to Piedmont Natural Gas, which filed its first base rate case in North Carolina in six years on April 1. We requested an $83 million revenue increase to recover costs for necessary infrastructure investments. The evidentiary hearing is scheduled for August 19 and we expect new rates to be effective by the end of the year.","Finally in South Carolina, we filed a motion for rehearing of our DEC and DEP electric rate cases in May. We requested reconsideration of the 9.5% ROE and the disallowance of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to implementation of North Carolina's Coal Ash Management Act. On June 19, the state's Public Service Commission issued a directive denying our motion for rehearing. We are awaiting the full order from the commission and are prepared to file an appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court.","Turning to our other utilities. Duke Energy Kentucky filed its 30-day notice of an electric rate case on August 1. We also continue to evaluate rate case timing in North Carolina for both DEC and DEP and expect to file rate cases for both later this year. We are executing on our regulatory strategy to recover our investments to serve our customers and remain focused on collaborating with stakeholders throughout the process.","Turning to slide 11, let me give you an update on our continued efforts to support our credit ratings and financing plan. First, in May, S&P affirmed our rating of BBB+ and revised their rating outlook to negative from stable. Some of the items they highlighted are singular in nature and will evolve over time. S&P provided a 12 to 24 month timeframe to work through these issues and we are focused on reaching resolutions during that time. We remain committed to our current credit ratings, which reflect our low risk business with tremendous scope and scale, geographical and regulatory diversity and constructive regulation.","As we outlined in February, our 2019 financing plan assumes a $500 million common equity issuance. And to-date, we have priced or issued approximately $420 million of that amount. We expect the balance to be issued through our drip in the third and fourth quarters. We also expect our 2019 credit metrics to be supported by refundable AMT credits of $575 million and the close of our commercial renewables minority stake sale to John Hancock, both of which should occur this fall.","Finally, in July, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2%. This is consistent with our plan to moderate our dividend growth over time, particularly given our robust capital plan. We continue target a payout ratio range of 65% to 75%, trending to the midpoint of this range over the five-year plan. Our financing plan prudently manages the balance sheet to support Duke Energy's credit quality and maintain financial flexibility as we execute our long term strategy.","I will close with slide 12. Our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields approximately 4.3%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low-risk investments, we offer a compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long term investment opportunity.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shar Pourreza","Hi. Good morning guys.","Lynn Good","Hi Shar. Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza","I want o delve into Carolina's policy a bit and this may be a question for Lloyd. So in South Carolina, you obviously got a low ROE negative outcome for coal ash which is on appeal. How is sort of the dialogue going in North Carolina? I mean they are obviously seeing what's going on and the two jurisdictions have been somewhat aligned in the past. You have the Piedmont case and you are eventually going to file a Duke in progress in the state. So how is sort of the conversations flowing in North Carolina, especially head into these GRCs? Should we be, I guess, concerned as there is some readthrough to what we are seeing in South Carolina just from a regulatory constructs standpoint?","Lynn Good","Shar, I want to be clear that we do not see a readthrough from South Carolina to North Carolina. North Carolina has historically been a very fair, impartial regulatory jurisdiction that recent decisions based on facts and evidence presented follows the law and we would certainly expect that to be the case as we think about regulatory outcomes moving forward.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Senate Bill 559, obviously in the prepared remarks, it's still sitting at the House. It's not on the calendar for a vote and you certainly highlighted budgetary, the lack of a budget as being one of the items that's curtailing it. Is there sort of anything else you want to highlight that could be a push or take? Do you have sense on sort of timing? Are we going into sort of a special session? So any sort of incremental color on how the conversations are flowing would be very helpful.","Lynn Good","Shar, we are very pleased with the progress that we have made with Senate Bill 559. We have strong bipartisan sponsorship of the Bill and as you indicated we are in the Rules Committee really waiting for other priorities that the general assembly has in front of them, specifically the budget. I think it's important to recognize that the Bill sponsors have continued to express support for moving this legislation and it is historically the case in North Carolina legislation that is taken up after the budget or even during the budget impasse.","So we continue to actively advocate for the Bill. We think the customer benefits and the policy involved and embodied in the Bill are very strong. Customer benefits, reducing costs for storms in the range of 15% to 20% and the policy allows for stakeholder settlements and engagements to develop an investment plan that delivers value to customers from storm hardening and resiliency to renewables and the improvements to customer experience. And recently in the House, we also added provisions to encourage low income investment.","So we think the combination of good policy and clear benefits to customers are very strong attributes of this Bill and we continue to advocate for it. I think in terms of timeline, we will have to see how these other priorities continue to shape up. There is no specific timeline I would share with you but we will continue to update as progress is made.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Thanks. And then just strategically, Lynn, it's the last question. I know you typically shy away from commenting on any strategic moves, but you have given us some sense on how you think about Santee Cooper and its ongoing process in South Carolina. If you sort of shift to Florida, is there any interest in JEA in case they pursue a privatization. I know the process has obviously started and the bids are due by September 30. Is there any interest there?","Lynn Good","Shar, we evaluate opportunities as you would expect as we see things that are in our service territory that we think are a fit for us. So that would be evaluating within the broad context of our business plan and we feel like our organic growth opportunities are quite strong and that would be our highest priority.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Congrats guys and a great start.","Lynn Good","Shar, thank you very much.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Hi Greg.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","So you guys had a really solid first half, $2.36. And I know that you are flagging some timing issues. But even with those taking into account, adding back your assumption of normal weather and then to the point that some of the point Steve made with regard to things that were positive drivers in the first half that should continue to be positive drivers in the second half, you would only need to do $0.01 better than last year and the second half to hit current consensus of $4.90, $0.15 to get to $5. So I am just wondering if you are comfortable articulating a little bit more where you think you will be in the range given that it seems that consensus might be a little bit too low for the balance of the year unless I am missing some big negative driver that you haven't disclosed?","Lynn Good","Greg, I will take a shot and then Steve can follow. Our typical approach on resetting specifics within the range follows the third quarter, which is just a statement of the obvious about how significant third quarter can be. So we will fine-tune the range as we historically have. But I think all the points that you are making around the strength of the start to the year, the way we are executing on our plan and the way we are controlling costs, the way we are working through the regulatory outcomes gives us high degree of confidence within the range. So I think we are off to a strong start and the team is focused on delivering and I would expect us to do that. We are waiting to see how weather in August and September plays out.","So Steve, have at it.","Greg Gordon","How has weather been through June and July relative to normal?","Lynn Good","So July has been hot, no doubt.","Steven Young","Yes. July has been, we have seen some favorable weather. The only thing I would add in terms of the last half of the year is a bit about shaping. We do have, as I mentioned, some renewables projects that are slated for the fourth quarter and we provided an exhibit there. But in terms of the year as a whole, I echo Lynn's comments entirely.","Greg Gordon","Right. So just to build on that statement, you do have a higher amount of net new megawatts coming into service in the second half, about 136 megawatts net increase even though that is shaped predominantly in the fourth quarter. At least that's the way --","Lynn Good","That's right. And you know, Greg, the other thing I would point to in the back-half. You may remember Florence and Michael in the third and fourth quarter last year. So that's another consideration you should think about O&M.","Greg Gordon","Great. Well, congratulations. It sounds like you are setting up to have a good year. So congrats.","Lynn Good","Greg, thank you. I appreciate that.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning Steve. How are you?","Steven Young","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","Doing great. I wanted to touch base on North Carolina legislation. If the legislation is enacted into law, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on what kinds of opportunities, perhaps longer term in terms of additional CapEx, additional areas of focus and spending, if you get that kind of support that we have been looking for?","Lynn Good","Stephen, I would think about Senate Bill 559 as being an enabler of the capital plan that we have laid out over the next five years. You will note that we have more investment in the delivery system really as part of the transformation that we see in the industry. And Senate Bill 559 provides an investment mechanism that very closely matches the investment with the benefits to customers. So I would think about it in that context. And as we think about actually putting 559 into place, we envision a stakeholder process where the investment priorities over the multiyear period would be informed in a way that drives the policy in the state. So this gives us a great opportunity to tailor those investments in a way that drives customer benefits. But I would think about it within the context of the plan we have in front of you. We think it's just very good policy at this stage of the industry transformation.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. Then maybe shifting gears over to Atlantic Coast. Obviously we had an unfavorable ruling from the Fourth Circuit on the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement. In the unfortunate event that a revised BO and ITS is also vacated again, would you mind just talking at a high-level to the range of options, whether that be other sources of natural gas, other approaches, generation needs? And I think just I know it's premature to talk in detail about what might be done but just as I am trying to think through the range of options would you mind just speaking to that at a high level?","Lynn Good","Sure. And there two points I would like to make, Stephen, on this. And the first one is that we are evaluating this order working closely with project partners and also efficient wildlife. There is an extensive work done. We are in the field now with surveys. And our intention is to work with the partners and federal agencies to address the Fourth Circuit concerns and in a manner that will withstand further challenge. That is our highest priority but I think the question that you are raising is one about the longer term implications and I would go to the business case for this investment in answer to that question because the business case remains extraordinarily strong. We need this infrastructure. Eastern North Carolina need this infrastructure, not only for the delivery of natural gas but for continued reduction in carbon emissions as we move away from coal. And so we will continue to pursue ways that we can get that infrastructure into the state but our highest priority and we think the best business case for customers is Atlantic Coast Pipeline.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. Thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi. Good morning.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Steven Young","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","If you could just talk about the timing of O&M that was mentioned in the quarter? Just wondering what are the issues that were being -- that contributed to different timing of O&M throughout the year?","Steven Young","Yes. What I was referring to basically relates to some outages and timing of outages year-over-year. So you will see some non-storm O&M timing that might turn around in the second half of the year. Lynn mentioned storms in the prior year. And if you look at storm O&M in the second half of the year, if we have a more normal second half of the year you might see some favorable O&M coming from that.","But some of the non-storm O&M may turn a bit in the second half of the year just because the timing of plant outages and that type of work. So I was just trying to give some flavor for it. We are very pleased with our efforts on O&M in the first half of the year. In response to the mild weather we saw in January and February, we enacted some efforts in our O&M agility, is the term we use internally, to help offset some of the impacts of that. And that's showing up as part of the $0.07 but some of its timing as well.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. And on the commercial renewables, you are about 70% line of sight for the five-year plan. Is there a possibility that you might be considering increasing the $2.5 billion investment plan for that segment?","Lynn Good","That will be something, Michael, we look at in connection with our five-year planning process, which is underway. But as we think about the five years, given all of the other capital investment opportunities we have, we are really looking for this segment to consistently deliver kind of at the level at that in 2019. And we have a high degree of confidence in its ability to do that because of the 70% that we have already locked in on growth target. So that's probably the way I would think about it at this point. But consistent with five-year planning, we will give every segment a review and make sure it has our best thinking as we come to the street with guidance in February.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And one last question on that on Bloom Energy. How did you guys get involved with fuel cells? Like what was the -- how did that decision process come about, just curious?","Lynn Good","Michael, we have a team that is looking at what I would call customer solutions. And so this is a team that works with large industrial, large commercial customers and really is working to customize solutions that those customers need to meet their energy requirements. It can be renewables, it can be battery technology, it can be microgrids, it could be a fuel cell technology. And so the Bloom investment was consistent with the growth priorities that that team is focused on and we believe this notion of customization of energy for large energy users is a trend that will just continue to grow.","Michael Weinstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time.","Lynn Good","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning. So Lynn, just going back to some of the comments you made earlier with respect to the coal ash order with the DEQ. Can you elaborate basically the next steps after the Judge's actions recently and just some of the specific nuances of how you go forward on appeals, et cetera?","Lynn Good","Sure. Simply put, Julien, we are moving forward on the appeal. And so what we would expect is a procedural calendar to come out establishing discovery and hearings and so on. And so we will continue to challenge the underlying decision itself, the science and engineering, the cost considerations, et cetera. We would expect a hearing to be in 2020 and we will know more as the calendar is established.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it.","Lynn Good","So I think it is a partial dismissal. Yes, partial dismissal.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes, absolutely, indeed. And then just if I can turn the focus back to Indiana quickly, you talked about the filing here. Can you elaborate a little bit with respect to the planning process and generation decisions? I know you talked about some acceleration here, but just more of the specifics here? I know the state has got a good bit of attention. So I just want to perhaps dig a little bit.","Lynn Good","Julien, the team in Indiana has done a lot of very good work to think about a thoughtful approach around the generation mix in the state. And so we have put together a proposal that shortens the life of certain of the assets and then introduces more investment in renewables and in natural gas which you will see in the IRP plan. So I think the first thing to focus on is the rate case which will run over the next six to nine months. And then the integrated resource plan is something that will continue to be a topic of discussion and review in the state. We believe we have put together a very thoughtful approach. We have had a very active stakeholder engagement not only with customers but with policymakers in the state and believe we have put forward a very thoughtful plan for Indiana.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But no timeline for further acceleration, right? It still seems like the acceleration is pretty long dated, right, to the remaining asset life?","Lynn Good","I think I would ask you to look at it because there is a fair amount acceleration on a couple of the units and then those will be a topic of discussion. Of course, as we go through the rate case and when I say we put together a thoughtful plan, I think that invites and offers an opportunity for further discussion, both with regulators and with other intervening parties. And our commitment is to develop a plan that makes sense for the customers of Indiana but also continues to lower carbon. And we think we have started that conversation well with the rate case and with the IRP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you very much for the time.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Lynn Good","Good morning.","Steven Young","Hello.","Praful Mehta","Morning. So a lot of topics covered so far. So I appreciate that. I just wanted to get a little bit more on the North Carolina, the DEQ that you just talked about. The $4 billion to $5 billion spend, if you could dimension for us what the risks are if you are not successful in the appeal in terms of is it all of a customer bill impacts and so that's the worry? Or is there some concern that some part of that $4 billion to $5 billion is not recoverable?","Lynn Good","Praful, I would make a couple of comments on that. And the first one is that the impact of the excavation order has a very limited impact on the five-year plan. So $200 million to $400 million falling in that five-year period because of the time required to secure permits and construct landfills and other things contemplated by the order. So we are talking about a period of time that is outside of the five years and with full excavation could extend all the way into the 2040 for certain of the sites. And so I think what it represents is a longer closure period that, in our opinion, increases cost without a measurable improvement in environmental benefits. And that will be the discussion as we go forward.","The North Carolina commission has approved recovery of costs for coal ash and so I would ask you to look at that order in terms of the press in the state and we will continue to make progress on these basins. Our commitment and DEQ's is exactly the same, which is to close them safely and that's where our focus remains as we pursue these legal matters and some fine tuning of the approach over the long term to close the basin.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just the same color on the South Carolina side, in terms of appealing the cases there. Could you give us some color on the specific issues that you are more focused on and how you see that playing out?","Lynn Good","Sure. In South Carolina, Praful, we are awaiting a final order on the cases. So we have gotten the directive. We have gotten the rehearing. But the actual order on rehearing has not yet been filed. We would expect it in the next period of time and then we have 30 days to appeal the order which we intend to do and we would appeal to the Supreme Court in South Carolina.","The disallowance of coal ash costs will be a part of that appeal. And I think it's important to recognize that the precedent between North and South Carolina is a long-standing one where the benefits between the two states are shared on generation and transmission. And remediation of coal ash would be a part of the decommissioning of plants. And these plants that then share the benefits of those plants with South Carolina customers over their entire life.","I think it's also important to recognize that both the federal and the state laws establish safe basin closure methods and excavation is an option in both. And so we would intend to continue to pursue this. I think the timeframe you should think about is probably one to two years to work through the process. But the cost doesn't start until we get the order and then file the appeal within 30 days. So we will continue to keep you posted as it moves through the process.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thank you. And then just finally in terms of, clearly you are having a strong first half. Is there any assumption on incremental O&M being pulled forward, given you have some budget or some room in your numbers to kind of maintain within the guidance? I just wanted to understand kind of any shipping on the O&M side for the second half?","Steven Young","Well, Praful, that capability to move O&M back and forth and toggle it based upon results is a core skill set that we have. It remains to be seen in the second half of the year dependent upon weather, storm activity and those kind of things whether we will pull those levers. But I mentioned, we pulled some of them in response to the mild weather in the first couple of months of the year. We have the capability of redirecting O&M in different fashion when we see favorable results as well. But I don't want to give any firm guidance going forward. We still have got the third quarter to go and the weather and storm sit in front of us. But we do have that capability.","Lynn Good","And Praful, the objective of all of this is to deliver on our commitments around the guidance that we have provided for the street and that's the way we will approach this.","Praful Mehta","Understood. Thanks so much guys and congratulations.","Lynn Good","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hi guys.","Lynn Good","Hi Michael.","Michael Lapides","Hi Lynn. I wanted to ask about North Carolina renewables. And can you remind us, A, what's already in your forecast for the amount of renewables you are building in North Carolina where you have already got approval through the RFP process? And then, can you remind us what the limits are and how much you think you could wind up doing beyond what's already known or in your plan?","Steven Young","Yes, Michael, I will take that. And regarding the limits to the HB589 regulations, there is a limit to our bidding and winning bids to 30% of the tranches that are going to be bid over the next several years. There is no limit to subsequent acquisition of another winning bidder's part interest. So ultimately we could own a higher percentage than 30% of the renewables assets from HB589.","I think for planning purposes, we have got about 30% in our plan. We have typically thought about that being in the commercial renewables segment. But it could be within the regulated business segment or the commercial renewables. The first tranche that was awarded of roughly 600 megawatts between regulated and commercial, we got about a third of that. So I think that's a reasonable planning assumption going forward.","Michael Lapides","So roughly a couple hundred megawatts a year installed run rate? Or is that a couple hundred megawatts over a several year period?","Steven Young","It will depend upon how much is bid through the process. We saw 600 megawatts. Initially it was 680 megawatts, but only 600 was awarded. If the tranches stayed at that level then it might be in the ballpark of 150 to 200 megawatts. The tranches going forward may be smaller than that as we grandfather other renewables into the process. But you can think about those numbers as a reasonable number to think about.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you. much appreciated.","Lynn Good","Thank you Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Sophie Karp","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Lynn Good","Hi Sophie.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Sophie Karp","I wanted to also a question on renewables and maybe from an angle that has clearly been a very successful program for you and an attractive niche. Is there a way to do more along those lines in addition to these tranches, maybe just those strictly in the commercial renewable space? And what's your view the probability that we are going to see some ITC and PTC extension?","Steven Young","A couple of things here. On the tranches of renewables that come through the HB589, we will continue to participate at that level. We think it makes sense. We know the service area. We know the grid surrounding of these assets. So again, I think that it will continue to be fruitful for us over the next several years.","Regarding ITC and PTC extensions, again, we have heard nothing about extending that specifically. They are set to expire and that is what we are basing our plans upon is that those particular tax benefits will begin to wind down.","Lynn Good","And Sophie, we commented a moment ago on the strength of the pipeline that sits in the commercial business. We feel very confident with our ability to deliver within our five-year plan and have a robust pipeline to support that. I think in terms of the Congressional extension of the credits, there is some discussion underway about that. We have been supporters of Congress' bipartisan agreement to fade them down. We believe that the economic competitiveness of the resource is very attractive and as a result are supportive of that fade down. But I think we will have to see what plays outs as the process continues in Washington.","Sophie Karp","Got you. Thank you. And then maybe, if I may, a quick follow-up on the coal ash in South Carolina. So your appeal right now is to the State Supreme Court, correct?","Lynn Good","Yes.","Sophie Karp","But ultimately, the issue is how these costs would be allocated between two different states? And should we expect this litigation ultimately find its way to the federal court?","Lynn Good","I believe the South Carolina Supreme Court is where it will be decided, Sophie. And there is a great deal of precedent over decades around the allocation of costs between North and South Carolina. We run the generation and transmission system as a system between North and South Carolina and have very established methods of allocating costs. And so we will be presenting very strong arguments on those costs and believe that it will be resolved at the Supreme Court level in South Carolina.","Sophie Karp","Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful color.","Lynn Good","Thank you Sophie.","Steven Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.","Lynn Good","Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Our IR team will be available this afternoon as usual to answer any follow-up questions and we look forward to seeing many of you in the weeks to come. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7637":["Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  2, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","James E. Rogers - Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Lynn J. Good - Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive","Analysts","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Kit Konolige","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Second Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bob Brennan [ph], Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Unknown Executive","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2012 earnings review and business update. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During the course of this call, we will discuss the company's strategic objectives, the status of our merger integration efforts and its financial impacts, an update on Crystal River 3 and our other major construction projects, and our results for the second quarter and outlook for 2012. After the prepared remarks, we'll welcome your questions.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information in our 2011 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials.","Please note that the appendix to the presentation materials includes supplemental information for Progress Energy's second quarter earnings and additional disclosures to help you analyze Duke Energy's performance.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Rogers.","James E. Rogers","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. As you saw in our release from earlier today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted EPS of $1.02 for the second quarter of 2012, $0.03 higher than our prior-year quarterly results of $0.99. These results exceeded consensus estimates and we continue to be on track to achieve our guidance range for 2012 of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. This range represents 6 months of Duke on a stand-alone basis and 6 months as a combined company with Progress.","After 18 months of hard work, we closed our merger on July 2. The strategic value of this transaction remains unchanged. The combination creates a new Duke with unmatched financial and operational scale and scope. The highly regulated business mix of the combined company supports the strength and growth of our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to manage through a time of transition in the utility industry.","Slide 4 illustrates our clear focus as a combined company. Our goals have not changed. We will continue our strong track record of meeting our financial commitments. We will complete our major construction projects to provide clean, reliable energy to our customers. We will continue to focus on the efficient, safe and excellent performance of our fleet and our electric grid. And finally, we will work constructively with regulators in each of our jurisdictions.","Let me highlight North Carolina and Florida. As many of you know, the sequence of events following the merger closing prompted the North Carolina Utilities Commission to schedule hearings about the unanticipated change in executive leadership. We presented testimony explaining the reasons behind the change. At the close of the hearing, before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Chairman Finley mentioned the prospects for settlement. We are exploring the potential for an acceptable resolution.","We are also working as a team to resolve Crystal River 3 in a way that meets the needs of our Florida customers, regulators and our investors. I've been asked to appear in front of the Florida commission on August 13 to discuss how the merger impacts our customers in Florida. I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to our customers in Florida.","We have much work to do. Our deep bench of experience and talented leaders will keep us focused on the success of the new company. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent appointments as I turn to Slide 5.","Keith Trent has assumed the role of Executive VP of our regulated utilities. This is a familiar role for Keith, as he previously led Duke's regulated utility business from '06 to 2009. Keith and his team, including our state presidents, will be focused on our regulatory relationships in each of our 6 regulated jurisdictions, as well as on the federal level.","Chuck Whitlock has stepped in to lead our commercial businesses. Chuck has served as President of our Midwest generation fleet since 2009 and has over 12 years of service to Duke Energy or its predecessors. He and his team's significant experience in commercial markets will provide strong leadership for this business.","Also, Lee Mazzocchi has been named to lead our integration efforts and will report directly to me. Lee has demonstrated strong execution skills and leadership abilities, and previously served as Progress's Chief Procurement Officer. Lee and his team will ensure the organization is keenly focused on achieving the merger benefits.","The IT and supply chain's functions will now report to Lynn Good, and other administrative functions will report to our Chief Human Resources Officer, Jennifer Weber.","Delivering the benefits of this merger for our customers and our investors is a key focus of our employees and our leadership team. Merger integration planning has been underway since we announced the merger in January 2011. Integration planning teams worked hard and put us in a great position for day 1 of the combined company. Key processes and systems were in place and up and running on July 2 to allow us to operate as one company.","The integration teams have identified more than 600 savings opportunities. Accountability for these initiatives has been assigned to each of our Executive Vice Presidents and their respective organization. The integration team, led by Lee, is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the status on these initiatives.","Our merger savings opportunities fall into 2 broad categories. The first is non-fuel O&M savings, which over time will benefit all customers and investors. The second is fuel and joint dispatch savings, which will immediately benefit our Carolinas customers.","Let me update you on our non-fuel O&M savings opportunities before discussing our fuel and joint dispatch savings. When we announced the merger, we targeted a savings run rate in the range of 5% to 7% of total non-fuel O&M. This level of savings continues to be within our overall planning assumptions of combined O&M of around $6 billion. Consistent with our plans, we expect to achieve the full run rate of savings by 2014.","Slide 6 includes a pie chart showing the broad categories of O&M savings opportunities we are projecting. Around 70% relate to consolidation of redundant functions, including labor savings and consolidation of IT systems. We are well on our way in both of these areas.","Around 1,100 employees across the organization have accepted our Voluntary Severance Program. Depending on their job function, these employees will transition their roles and leave the companies at varying points within the next 15 months. We expect over half of these employees will leave the company by the end of 2012 as we begin consolidating corporate functions. We expect to achieve the remaining targeted labor reductions by 2014 by not filling some of our current vacancies and through normal attrition.","We expect to consolidate duplicate IT systems into single platforms, leveraging investments made by Duke Energy to build scalable IT systems. 19 projects were completed in connection with legal day 1 and 55 more will be underway by the end of 2012. The remaining savings will come from implementing operational best practices, such as common operating models, centralized support organizations and standardized work practices. In addition, we expect supply chain and purchasing benefits that come from increased size and scale. Some of these have already been put in place.","Slide 7 shows you our progress in realizing fuel and joint dispatch savings. Beginning on day 1 of the merger, we are jointly dispatching generating fleets to the Carolinas. In fact, yesterday, we filed a request with the Carolinas commissions to reduce customers' rates by around $89 million over the next 12 months. This will allow our Carolinas customers to begin receiving benefits in their bills as early as this fall.","We have guaranteed a minimum of $650 million in joint dispatch and fuel savings over the first 5 years after merger close. We also have an additional 18 months of timing flexibility if we determine we're unable to achieve the savings within 5 years due to the impact of low natural gas prices on gas consumption. We are confident in our ability to achieve this level of savings.","Fuel savings are expected to be achieved primarily through coal blending and coal purchasing efficiencies, which result in enhanced buying power and reduced coal transportation costs. Just over 60% of the projected fuel savings are already under contract.","Jeff Lyash and his team have been closely monitoring the joint dispatch savings. On a typical day, we move more than 1,000 megawatts between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. Every megawatt-hour that flows between these systems represents savings for our customers. This success results from outstanding teamwork and is happening without sacrificing reliability during some of the recent hot weather.","We feel good about where we are from an integration perspective and will work hard to deliver on the level of savings we expected to result from this transaction.","I want to recognize our employees, nearly 30,000 strong, who have remained dedicated to their work and to achieving quick results. I am pleased with how our people are working together. We look to finalize the remainder of the organization very shortly. We're operating as one team, one company, united in our mission to deliver value and benefits to our customers, investors and the communities we serve.","Turning to Slide 8, I want to take a few minutes to discuss where we are with Crystal River 3. Many of you recall that in late 2009, Crystal River 3 experienced a delamination of its containment structure and has remained out of service since that time. The delamination was repaired. Then in March 2011, a second delamination occurred during re-tensioning of the structure. Throughout 2011 and 2012, work has been underway to refine and advance engineering on a potential repair solution.","We are also pursuing insurance recovery from NEIL, a mutual insurance company that provides coverage to the nuclear industry. In February 2012, a settlement agreement was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission which outlines a framework for regulatory treatment of either a decision to repair or retire the unit.","Let me give you an update on 3 critical items: one, the status of the technical repair option; two, the status of ongoing discussions with NEIL; and finally, our decision process on the best way to move forward with Crystal River 3.","Work continues on the technical repair option, which involves removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the structure. Over the last year, progress has been made on the engineering and vendor selection required for the repair option. Refinement of the engineering and the associated risk assessment for the repair option continues, including completion of an independent technical review initiated by the Duke board. Based on the preliminary results of this independent review, the repair plan appears to be technically feasible, but issues remain that need to be resolved as the engineering and risk assessment continues.","As of June 2011, repair costs were estimated at between $900 million to $1.3 billion based upon preliminary engineering. These estimates are under continuing review, and while this process has not yet been finalized, the cost estimate is trending higher.","Let me move to insurance coverage. Insurance coverage related to repair costs and incremental costs of replacement power is held through NEIL. There are a few important points to note. First, this is the largest claim that NEIL has received in its history. NEIL has established a special committee to carefully evaluate the claim. Second, related to the first delamination, NEIL has made payments, but has withheld a payment of approximately $7 million, the majority of which related to replacement power cost. We expect these costs will be recoverable through the fuel clause in Florida.","Further, NEIL has not made any payments on the second delamination. NEIL has also not yet provided a final written coverage decision for either delamination. We continue to meet with NEIL representatives. In order to attempt to resolve differences between the parties, we have entered into a non-binding mediation process with NEIL. The mediation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter.","Let me highlight key next steps in our evaluation. We continue to analyze both repair and retire scenarios. Our final economic analysis and our decisions will be informed by the following factors: engineering, vendor selection, contract negotiations, risk assessments, insurance availability, insurance recovery and customer impacts. Although we recognize the importance of making a repair or retire decision by the end of 2012 under the Florida settlement agreement, we are not prepared, at this time, to set a date certain by which such decision will be made. We will continue to update you on key decisions and milestones related to our assessment as they occur. Our decisions will be made within the context of the existing and very important regulatory settlement provisions in Florida. Crystal River is a high priority for Duke, our customers and the communities that we serve.","Turning now to Slide 11 (sic) [Slide 9], let me give you an update on Edwardsport in Indiana and other major construction projects in the Carolinas. The target date for placing Edwardsport IGCC plant in service has moved from early September 12 to early 2013. This is due to testing and start-up taking longer than originally expected as we work through this large, complex project. The new target date gives us more time for the remaining testing and start-up procedures to ensure that we have identified and corrected all issues prior to the in-service date. The start-up delays which have occurred today have impacted the level of contingencies related to this project. As a result, we're continuing to evaluate the estimated cost to complete the project and we'll provide updates as appropriate. We presently do not expect additional costs to be material in the overall cost of the project.","We've achieved major milestones, including operation of the plant's turbines. We put power into the electric grid during testing and we expect the plant to produce power using natural gas ahead of commercial operations. More than half of all the operating systems of the plant are under the care, custody and control of the operations group, meaning they were successfully constructed, tested and ready for service.","General Electric's new product introduction validation process is well underway, with both gas turbines having cleared GE's stringent process using natural gas. Validation of the gasification system is the next critical step. Related to the settlement agreement we reached with certain intervening parties in late April, hearings were completed in mid-July. The next steps include the settling parties filing a proposed order on August 17 and reply briefs to the intervenor exceptions on September 14. We expect a commission decision in the fourth quarter of this year.","In the Carolinas, the Cliffside clean coal project and 3 combined cycle gas projects, Dan River, Lee and Sutton, are all on schedule and on budget. We intend to file rate cases at Duke Carolinas and Progress Carolinas later this year, requesting the recovery of Cliffside, Dan River and Lee plant. The construction of all 3 plants were authorized by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.","We also expect to retire 3 of Progress Energy's Carolinas coal plants later this year: the H.F. Lee Plant, the Cape Fear Plant and Robinson Unit 1. These plants represent total capacity of approximately 900 megawatts, which is in addition to the approximate 1,700 megawatts of capacity Duke Energy Carolinas has already announced that it will retire.","In our renewables business, we just completed the 130 megawatt Cimarron wind project. We have remaining projects of 640 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2012.","Now I'll turn it over to Lynn, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter, as well as some perspective on Progress's second quarter results. She will also provide additional financial updates.","Lynn J. Good","Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments; an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions; our financial objectives for 2012, including our earnings per share guidance range for the combined company; our financial objectives going forward; and finally, a few comments on Progress's quarterly results.","It's important to highlight that our quarterly results do not include Progress Energy's results, as the merger closed on July 2. However, Progress will be included in our consolidated results beginning with the third quarter.","As highlighted on Slide 10, Duke reported second quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02. This compares to $0.99 per share for the prior quarter. At current year and prior year earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed immediately prior to closing the merger with Progress in early July.","Our regulated U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment income that was $0.09 higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas implemented in February of this year. We also had lower O&M costs as a result of fewer major storms. We continue to closely manage our O&M costs, particularly in our fossil fleet, given the lower natural gas price environment and lower generation from our coal plants. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Even though cooling degree days were 18% higher than normal, this was lower than the approximate 25% variance to normal in the prior quarter.","Let's move on to international, which as expected, had segment income $0.05 per share lower than the prior year quarter. International's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing in Central America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Partially offsetting these results were favorable results in Brazil and Peru due to higher average prices.","Turning our attention now to our non-regulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was fairly consistent with the prior year quarter. However, there were a few key drivers to highlight. Due largely to the implementation of our new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio, we entered 2012 anticipating lower results from Commercial Power. As expected, our coal generation margins were down $0.07 per share. This was largely offset by the non-bypass-able stability charge which we are collecting through the end of 2014, which added $0.05 per share.","Our non-regulated Midwest gas fleet continued to generate at record volumes, as quarterly generation was around 80% higher than the prior year quarter. However, these higher volumes were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues.","Let me close with a few comments about our Ohio operations. Ohio has recently approved a state compensation mechanism for FRR entities, authorizing the recovery of their cost for capacity. As you know, Duke Energy Ohio is an FRR entity through May 2015, receiving market-based payments for capacity. We are reviewing the applicability of this recent decision to Duke Energy Ohio.","There have also been recent market rumors about a potential sale of our Midwest generation assets. It is not our practice to comment on market rumors of this nature. But as we have shared with you, we are evaluating strategic options for this asset portfolio, but no decisions have been made. We will continue to update you as our plans develop.","Slide 11 contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class for the Carolinas, Midwest and in total, based on calculations that exclude weather impacts. For the second quarter, our overall weather-normal volumes were around 1.3% higher than the prior year period, with similar increases seen in both the Carolinas and Midwest. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which was 2.8% higher than the prior year quarter.","In the Carolinas, the automotive sectors showed strength, while textiles continued their recent weakness. The Midwest experienced strength in the heavy equipment and automotive sectors, while softness was seen in the primary and fabricated metals sectors.","Our residential customer class continues to grow at a modest level. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were higher by around 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. This level of growth is mostly due to an increase of approximately 20,000, or 0.5%, average residential customers in the Carolinas and Midwest. Average residential kilowatt-hour usage has remained fairly consistent to the prior year.","Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.8% higher than the prior year quarter. Continued volatility in retail sales trends and high office vacancy rates keep growth in this sector at modest levels.","Consistent with our outlook during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. As a result, we are currently expecting fairly flat weather-normalized load for 2012 compared with 2011.","Before we move on to the financial impacts of the merger, let me briefly discussed Progress' results for the quarter. Progress recognized second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter. One of the largest contributing factors to these lower results was higher O&M costs of $0.23 per share, primarily due to an additional planned nuclear outage in the Carolinas. In addition, quarterly results were unfavorably impacted by weather in the Carolinas and Florida, a $0.09-per-share impact. Finally, lower costs of renewable amortization in Florida reduced earnings by $0.11 per share.","We have included several earnings-related slides that you are accustomed to seeing for Progress in the appendix to today's presentation.","Let's turn now to the financial impacts of the merger. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize incremental goodwill of approximately $12 billion related to the Progress transaction. Additionally, we expect accounting charges resulting from the merger of between $450 million and $550 million to be recognized primarily in the last half of this year. These charges will be treated as special items and primarily consist of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plans, concessions agreed to with the Carolina commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs.","","For the combined company, we continue to target 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. As outlined on this slide, we expect the contribution from Progress in the last half of the year will be largely offset by the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger.","Let me also highlight a few highlights of our financing plan. We have a busy financing calendar for the remainder of the year focused on funding our capital expenditures and debt maturities. In addition to about $1.3 billion of long-term financings at our Carolinas and Florida utilities, we have more than $2 billion of funding requirements planned at our holding company. Our holding company plan includes almost $1 billion of debt issued to reduce leverage at Duke Energy Ohio in connection with the pending transfer of generation assets out of the utility. This holding company needs will be met primarily with long-term taxable and tax-exempt debt, but may also include issuance of commercial paper. We will also complete non-recourse financings internationally and in our renewable energy business.","Our current business plan continues to support no equity issuances through 2014. We have included further details on our assumed 2012 cash flows and financing plan in the appendix to today's presentation.","I will close with Slide 13, which addresses our main financial objectives. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the combined company. The earnings growth potential of the company will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses, achieving reasonable regulatory outcomes, achieving merger integration benefits, managing our costs and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.","We expect to provide more specifics on our earnings growth opportunities by early 2013. At that time, we will have completed our normal 3-year financial planning process with the new management team and Board of Directors. We also expect to have greater clarity around the timing and expected financial impacts of our rate case filings in the Carolinas by early next year.","We continue to focus on growing the dividend on an annual basis with a targeted dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. In fact, in June, we announced an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend payable in September.","Before I close, I would like to briefly address S&P's decision to downgrade our credit ratings last week. The rating agency cited lack of transparency and heightened regulatory risk around the CEO transition. While we were disappointed and disagree with S&P's rating action and its assessment of the company's risk profile and governance practices, we remain committed to maintaining high credit quality and constructive relationships with our rating agencies. Our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics continue to be strong, and both Moody's and Fitch have maintained stable outlooks for Duke Energy following the close of our merger.","In summary, the size, scale and higher regulated business mix of the combined company gives us a solid base upon which to build. We expect to deliver on our commitment in order to achieve our financial objectives.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","James E. Rogers","Thanks, Lynn. In summary, we are focused on our overall mission to deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to our customers in a safe manner, while providing attractive returns to our investors. We have important work ahead of us for the remainder of the year and we know what we need to do. Our efforts will center on efficiently integrating the operations and people of the combined company; achieving the benefits to customers and investors we expected from this transaction; meeting our financial objectives of achieving our earnings guidance range, increasing our dividend and maintaining a strong balance sheet; successfully managing our generation projects and resolving Crystal River 3; filing rate cases in the Carolinas for both Duke and Progress by the end of the year; and finally, moving forward constructively with our regulators and key stakeholders.","Before I open up the phone lines for your questions, let me correct one thing that I've said earlier. In talking about the first delamination, I said that NEIL has made payments but has withheld payment of approximately $70 million. I said $7 million. Maybe that was just wishful thinking, but they withheld payment of approximately $70 million, the majority of which relate to replacement power costs.","With that, let's open up the phone lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dan Eggers from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, just -- I know you're going to probably dance around this a little bit, but as it relates to the commission's openness to some sort of settlement discussions, can you maybe give some context? Does that -- does \"settlement discussion\" mean a financial settlement, a corporate governance settlement, a job settlement, a Raleigh settlement? Can you just help us understand what that conversation is actually headed toward?","James E. Rogers","Dan, I'm not going to speculate on the outcome of the commission's investigation or our settlement discussions. We're going to continue to work closely and maintain an open dialogue with the commission. Chairman Finley, at the end of the hearings, offered up the possibility of a settlement and we're clearly working in that direction.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But, Jim, can I just dumbly ask, what exactly are you guys settling, other than the fact of their investigation is to the CEO change?","James E. Rogers","I'm really, Dan, not going to address the issues that are being discussed in the settlement process, but as we get this resolved -- and our goal line is, as quickly as possible, to put this behind us and move forward, and that's the road that we're on.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, Jim, I guess just along these awkward kind of questions, with the 2 board members leaving from the Progress side, how is the board thinking about sizing and potential replacements and any kind of view on balance relative to the legacy Duke board membership?","James E. Rogers","The decision with respect to whether to replace the members that left really resides with the corporate governance committee and ultimately with the board. And they will make that decision in the coming weeks and months. And so my hope is, as we build this great company, I want everyone at the company to be part of that going forward, and that includes our new board members.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just as it relates to the Carolinas rate cases for both utilities this fall, or this winter, is there any thoughts on changing the timing, given all that's gone on, to give a little bit more breathing room before you head back before the commission?","James E. Rogers","Our intent, Dan, is to file our rate cases in the Carolinas by the end of the year. We expect they will address each case on its merits. I look back over the last 5 years. We've had 3 certificate cases, we have had 3 rate cases and all of them have resulted in fair outcomes. And as I look at the commission and its history, it has had a long history of fairly and equitably balancing the interest of customers and investors, and I don't expect that to change in the future.","Operator","We'll go to the next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a quick question on -- it seems like the weakness in Progress in the first half in their numbers was largely a result of these additional nuclear outage costs. And I look back to their first quarter call, they were -- it seemed they were assuming there would be an accounting order allowing level-ization of those costs approved sometime later in the year. And when we look at your slide showing the impact of the merger in the second half, it doesn't appear that you've assumed success on an order like that, but I just wanted to verify that, that's the case or not.","Lynn J. Good","Jonathan, your recollection is right. The 2012 earnings guidance for Progress did assume a successful regulatory order. And although we're still evaluating that regulatory order around the matter of nuclear level-ization, we are presently not planning to file it in 2012. As Jim mentioned, our focus is really on the rate cases for both Duke and Progress.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you're not even going to file that. Could you -- would you be able to tell us, Lynn, how beneficial to the 2013 outlook the absence of such an accounting structure would be as you fold in a better first half from Progress next year?","Lynn J. Good","Yes, Jonathan, the impact of nuclear level-ization in any given year is dependent upon the nuclear outages and the cost considerations and so on, so I can't give you any further insight into that. As we said, we will -- are working diligently on 2013 guidance in bringing the companies together and we'll have information around that early 2013.","Operator","We'll move next to Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When we think about O&M synergies, the 5% to 7% off of a $6-billion base, is it safe to assume that kind of just for back-of-the-envelope math, you would take that $6-billion base, you would grow it by inflation or some number, and then you would subtract the midpoint, let's say, 6% of the $6 billion, to kind of get to a -- what would be a normalized post-merger run rate for O&M?","Lynn J. Good","Michael, I'm not sure I followed all of that math, but I do think you should consider inflation. As you think about projecting costs into the future, I think you should consider new resources that we bring into the mix. And the 5% to 7% is kind of an industry average of what companies have been able to accomplish. We're going aggressively after that and we'll have more specifics on the impact on '13 and beyond as we give you more visibility into our guidance.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. One other question. Indiana. Does the delay in the in-service date, early 2013 for Edwardsport, does that delay your impact of the timing, not just of the settlement that's been reached to date, but also the timing of rate increases related to Edwardsport and even kind of filing a true-up case down the road?","Lynn J. Good","Michael, I don't believe so. We have -- we're working on the settlement and the construct of the settlement which would have us placing into rates, first of all, the return on the agreed-to amount of capital investment and then subsequently placing the plant into service under a rider with depreciation and O&M. We've agreed to a stay-out on the general base rate case but that would be through a filing date of '13. So I don't see those dates changing with the schedule we've talked about today.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning you'd file a full case in '13 to get Edwardsport -- anything left of Edwardsport or anything else in Indiana in the rates by early 2014.","Lynn J. Good","That's correct.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to touch base with you on the 4% to 6% growth. I know that you guys, in early July, indicated that you guys still targeted that. I know you're not giving guidance for 2013 and we're going to get more information as time goes on, but a lot has changed here with respect to just the environment in general and what we see in Progress. I'm just sort of -- like to sort of get a general sense of your level of confidence, I guess, Jim, with respect to how you feel about that 4% to 6% growth. I mean, do you feel better about it, less better about it? You've had a month now to sort of, with the integration process and what have you -- I mean, can you give us any sort of flavor for that?","James E. Rogers","Paul, my view is that we're in the process of reviewing all the numbers, working through them, but we believe that we will be able to hit that 4% to 6% growth. We're going to have to be aggressive with respect to reducing the cost and we're about that now. So more to come on that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay, then there's just the capacity, the potential for, I guess, a capacity uplift, it sounds like, in Ohio. Could you give us a sense as to how that would work with respect to your recent settlement there, or just in general, how we should think about that? You mentioned it, and of course, it is a point that they did put out that order. I'm just trying to get a sense as to how we might be able to think about that.","Lynn J. Good","Paul, we're evaluating the recent rulings in Ohio. And because we are an FRR entity, we think there could be some applicability of that ruling and we'll be evaluating that. And the basic issue is that a cost-based method of recovery for capacity, in our mind, would be -- result in a greater level of earnings than the stabilization charge that we negotiated in our existing settlement in Ohio. And so we're closely looking at it, we're evaluating it and we'll have more to say as we complete that evaluation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Could you just remind us how many megawatts you have in Ohio?","Lynn J. Good","Around 4,000.","Operator","The next question comes from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question around the nuclear operations. I think in the testimony before the North Carolina Commission, it was mentioned that the state of Progress nuclear operations was one of the factors that led to the board to kind of rethink the value of the Progress merger, and that statement seems to have been borne out by the first quarter results. I wonder if you could comment on what you perceive to be the primary operational challenges of the Progress nuclear fleet and what your plans are to rectify them.","Lynn J. Good","Hugh, I'll start really commenting on the results and then turn it to Jim for any further color. I think the results of Progress really reflect normal refueling outages for 3 plants, and what you're seeing is the difference between the number of outages in 2012 versus 2011. There were 3 outages in the first half of '12, one outage in the first half of '11. So our focus on nuclear spending, investment capital, O&M is something that we're working through. It's in connection with our normal planning cycle and we'll be reflecting what we believe is appropriate spending across our entire fleet as we look to the years ahead.","James E. Rogers","And I would address it by simply reflecting on the testimony that was given earlier. We had seen over the last 18 months a deterioration in the operation of the fleet. And one of our missions is to basically invest in the fleet, change the operation of the fleet in a way to allow us to return all those plants to excellence, and that's the mission we are on. Dhiaa Jamil is leading that effort. He has been to all the facilities. They're working together and I have great belief, as we have one of the largest fleets in the country with 11 different units located geographically just in the Carolinas, which is kind of a unique footprint to have all the plants so close together, that we will be able to invest more in the plants that need more investment, but at the same time save cost because we're operating on a fleet basis. So that's something, I think, that at the end of the day, our focus is always on safe and reliable operation of the fleet, and doing it in a cost-effective way is what we plan to do.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I also had a question, if you don't mind, on Edwardsport. Given your coal supply contract at Edwardsport and the currently prevailing forward price curves for natural gas, do you expect the combined cycle gas turbine at that plant to operate on synthesis gas from the gasifier? Or would you expect to dispatch it using pipeline natural gas?","James E. Rogers","In that, until we get through the validation process on the gas processor, I mean, we will be primarily focused at using natural gas. That plant has the ability to use syngas or natural gas. In this interim period, while we are going through that validation process, we will run the unit on natural gas. And then when we finish, we will connect the gasifier and produce natural gas because it will be one of the cleanest, most efficient coal plants in the world.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. Are there going to be any difficulties, however, I guess is what I'm trying to get at, with respect to fuel cost recovery, if there's a cheaper alternative available by taking gas from the pipeline? And then, conversely, if one takes gas off the pipeline, is there going to be any regulatory difficulty around the use and useful status of the gasifier?","James E. Rogers","We don't view that as a problem and it really goes to 2 things. One is it's in MISO. It will be dispatched in MISO. And at the end of the day, because of the efficiency of the plant, it will be one of the -- the first plant -- coal plants to be dispatched.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Bischof for Morningstar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is there any clarity you can give us on when you might receive a final decision on the total costs relating to Crystal River 3? And you also mentioned they were trending higher. Can you put a specific dollar amount on that?","Lynn J. Good","I'll start, Andy. Work continues on the engineering related to Crystal River, the risk assessment, a number of factors. And so that preliminary estimate that was shared, $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion, was really developed back in 2011. And the work continues, as we referenced in the script today, and as we learn more and complete the work, we'll be prepared to talk about a more definitive cost estimate, but nothing beyond just trending higher at this point.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, and one other question regarding non-fuel savings. You mentioned 100% by 2014. Can you provide a little more clarity on the expectation of savings obtained in 2013 and '12?","Lynn J. Good","Not at this point, Andy. That'll be important -- an important part of consideration in guidance for '13. But you can think of us ramping up savings over time between now and '14.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll move next to Kit Konolige from BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige","On your sales, Lynn, I think you discussed, obviously, sales were up year-over-year. I think you mentioned that you have an expectation for flat sales going forward. Can you just backfill that for me? I'm not sure I caught all of it.","Lynn J. Good","Yes, Kit, we are up, for the second quarter, 1.3%. On a year-to-date basis, we're up 1.1%. So we just continue to be cautious about what we're seeing, slowing in the broad U.S. economy. Even some of our industrial customers are not particularly bullish, looking at their production to be basically flat with '11. So we believe a reasonable assumption could be flat to 2011, and of course, we'll update you as we know more. But read nothing more into it than just some caution about the U.S. economy.","Kit Konolige","And how about then looking, say, ahead to '13 or even a little longer term? I mean, structurally, what kind of sales growth do you see on either side of the system at this point?","Lynn J. Good","That's a really good question and something we look at a couple of times a year as we try to forecast what trends we're seeing. I think a reasonable planning assumption, Kit, is kind of in the 1% range. Maybe we'd trend to 1.5% as you get further in the decade, but we are not forecasting anything stronger than that at this point.","Kit Konolige","Okay. And one final area, separately. Obviously, you're not going to comment in detail about any potential sale or divestiture of the Midwest unregulated plants. Could you give us any idea, though, on -- if you did no longer own those, what would the EPS impact be? In other words, suppose they were -- you were not to own them, does that hurt earnings, help earnings?","Lynn J. Good","Kit, I think the assets that we're talking about are very significant contributors to the Commercial Power segment, so that would be the place to look in terms of your overall contribution to the company. And I think in terms of, is it accretive, dilutive, would depend upon pricing and the timing of any decisions. So that's the perspective I would give you.","James E. Rogers","At this time, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming weeks during the fall sell-side conferences. As always, our Investor Relations team is available for your follow-up calls. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's presentation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's second quarter 2017 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.","As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on our efforts to achieve timely cost recovery in North Carolina, how we continue to transform the customer experience, and the progress we have made on our strategic investments. Steve will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and insight about our economic and low growth trends. He will also provide more details about our North Carolina rate cases before closing with our key investor considerations.","With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 for the second quarter. These results reflect strong execution in driving growth, managing cost and making progress on our strategic investment priorities. We remain on track to deliver our full year earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. During the quarter, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 4.1%, in line with our policy to grow dividends consistent with our long-term growth in earnings. This marks the 91st consecutive year we've paid a cash dividend to our investors.","Turning to operations, we've continued to pursue excellence in everything we do. The second quarter is an important quarter for nuclear outages. Over the last two years, our nuclear leadership team has been focused on driving greater productivity into our outage performance. That work is delivering results. In McGuire Station, we completed a 23-day unit outage, a new record for McGuire. And at our Catawba Station, the team completed an outage in 24 days, five days ahead of schedule. These efforts are consistent with our strategy to find additional efficiencies in our processes and more effectively manage outage timelines.","Our Edwardsport plant is also setting new operational records. Gasifier availability has improved to over 85% year-to-date. The plant is also in the midst of a record-setting run of more than 200 consecutive days, an increase of nearly 20% over the prior station record. As a result of the strong operational performance, electric generation has exceeded the prior year by more than 8%. In addition, EEI recently presented us their Excellence Award for Supplier Diversity, highlighting our focus on collaborating with a diverse set of vendors and suppliers as we advance our long-term strategy. And Piedmont Natural Gas was named America's second most trusted utility among residential customers, according to a nationwide survey. These results demonstrate the dedication and commitment of our employees. I want to thank them for their focus on safe operations by serving (4:02) our customers with reliable energy every day.","Moving to slide 5, I wanted to spend a few minutes highlighting progress on our strategy; investing in infrastructure our customers value, and delivering sustainable growth. This slide outlines the underlying investment priorities, strengthening and modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, and expanding our natural gas infrastructure. Importantly, it also highlights key foundational elements to our success: customer focus and stakeholder engagement. Today, I will update you on work underway on these two foundational elements, focusing on House Bill 589 and the customer experience, followed by an update on our strategic investment priorities.","Slide 6 includes a summary of recently enacted legislation, House Bill 589, also known as the Competitive Energy Solutions for North Carolina Act. This legislation provides a strong example of stakeholder engagement and progress, and achieving timely investment recovery in North Carolina. It outlines a thoughtful, rational approach to renewables growth that supports our commitment to deliver reliable and cleaner energy to customers and timely returns to investors, and it has the broad support of a wide range of stakeholders. The law reforms the PURPA process, and helps integrate new renewable generation in a way that balances reliability and affordability. It will now allow costs associated with standard contracts for Qualified Facilities to be recovered through the state's fuel costs. It also creates a competitive bidding process for approximately 2,600 megawatts of utility-scale renewable energy projects.","Duke Energy will have an opportunity to participate with self-build projects, up to a 30% cap. However, utilities may also acquire projects from third parties, and these acquisitions are not subject to the cap. The law also allows for the recovery of costs associated with these projects through a new rider to be established by the Commission. The competitive bidding process will ensure that new renewables are brought on to the system at market-based rates, delivering nearly $1 billion in savings for our customers over the next decade. It will support the continued growth in renewables in a market-driven and customer-focused way, and provide an opportunity for additional utility-owned investment by our Carolinas utility.","This legislative accomplishment demonstrates the importance of stakeholder support and collaboration. We continue to lay the foundation to advance a broader public policy agenda in North Carolina that supports a healthy, robust, energy market through energy grid investment. Strengthening and modernizing the grid will deliver tremendous benefits to our customers, while also creating thousands of new jobs and putting millions of dollars right back into our local communities through new economic development. Our agenda will include both legislative and regulatory initiatives.","Turning to slide 7, as we implement our vision for Duke, the customer is at the center of all we do, enhancing their experience is a strategic part of our infrastructure investment strategy. Work is underway to expand customer control, convenience, and choices about their energy experience. Examples include programs such as Pick Your Own Due Date (sic) [Pick Your Due Date] and Prepaid Advantage. Customers can select a billing due date that fits their personal preferences. Prepaid Advantage is a pilot program that allows customers to choose the amount, date, and frequency at which they prepay for their energy services.","Customers with smart meters now also receive energy usage alerts, minimizing surprises when their bill arrives. And smart meters will also allow us to enhance our existing outage awareness communication. Finally, as outlined on this slide, we are launching a new Duke Energy customer app in early 2018. The app will provide real-time personalized updates, giving our customers more control over their energy usage and enhancing their interactions with Duke Energy. Our customers expect customized solutions, and we're expanding our services to meet and exceed their expectations.","Turning to slide eight, I want to highlight a few of our strategic investments. In the second quarter, we advanced our plans to install smart meters across our service areas. The Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our plans to deploy smart meters to our Northern Kentucky electric customers. This will add to the more than 2 million meters we have already installed across our service territories. We're also making progress with our investments in low carbon natural gas plants and renewables. Our W.S. Lee, Citrus County and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants are progressing on schedule and remain on budget. And we're advancing our proposed expansion of our Lincoln Combustion Turbine site using state-of-the-art Siemens technology.","Also in mid-July, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our contract to move forward with a combined heat and power project with Clemson University. Shifting to our gas business, we've reached significant milestones for two of our natural gas pipeline projects. FERC issued the Final Environmental Impact statement for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline on July 21st. Federal and state permitting efforts are proceeding in parallel and are on track. We look forward to the confirmation of the current FERC appointees to ensure a quorum. This will allow the Commission to issue the final project certificate this fall, keeping the project on target for an in-service state in the second half of 2019.","As of July 3, the Sabal Trail main line is now in service, delivering much needed natural gas to the Southeast region. We are also on track to complete the lateral to our new Citrus County combined-cycle plant in October. We continue to work through the permitting process for the proposed Constitution Pipeline project. We anticipate that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision will be issued soon. In light of this delay, the targeted in-service date has been revised to as early as the first half of 2019. Natural gas will play a major role on our continued growth, and we're committed to expanding our infrastructure to meet our customers' needs.","In closing, we're now halfway through 2017 and building momentum for the future. We remain on track to deliver current year results. We are also maintaining a strong focus on our strategic priorities, our customers, the energy grid, generating clean energy, developing gas infrastructure and ongoing stakeholder engagements. We are excited about the progress and growth we see in our business and remain committed to the foundation of our success, safety and operational excellence.","Now, let me turn the call over to Steve.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the second quarter, discuss current retail volume trends, and update you on economic indicators. I will also provide an overview of our recently filed rate case for Duke Energy Progress North Carolina. I'll close with the summary of our key investor considerations.","Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide nine and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany in today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 second quarter earnings per share were $0.98 compared to $0.74 last year. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.07 in the second quarter of 2016. Lower results in the current year reflect the absence of International Energy, which contributed $0.05 in the prior year quarter, and the effects of less favorable weather. Absent these factors, we saw solid growth across each of our operating segments.","Electric Utilities & Infrastructure quarterly adjusted results were up $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter. This performance was primarily driven by higher retail revenues from increased pricing in riders, and stronger retail volumes. I'll discuss the individual drivers of volume growth by customer class in just a moment. Regulatory pricing is higher as a result of the recent activity in our DEP South Carolina utility, and from generation base rate adjustments in Florida. As for riders, we are seeing incremental growth in our Indiana and Ohio grid investment riders, and utility-sponsored energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas. We continue to manage cost across the business. Finding additional efficiencies and optimizing our resources, we are on track to meet our O&M savings goals for the year, exhibiting flexibility to mitigate the unfavorable weather in the first quarter. We've made great progress today, and we'll continue to work hard managing costs in the second half of the year.","Gas Utilities & Infrastructure results were primarily driven by our ongoing investments in the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. As expected, the LDC results were flat in the quarter and we continue to expect these businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. Moving on, our Commercial Renewables segment was up $0.02 for the quarter. Increased wind resource and production from new projects brought on line in 2016 were partially offset by lower solar ITCs in the current year. Other was down $0.07 for the quarter. This was driven by higher tax expense, primarily due to a prior year favorable IRS resolution and higher interest expense at the holding company from the Piedmont acquisition financing. Based on our results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we are on track to finish within our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share.","Turning to slide 10, I'll review our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load was 0.6%, driven by improvement across all customer classes. Excluding the impact of the leap day in the prior year, our rolling 12-month volume growth would have been 0.9%. Building upon our first quarter trends, growth in the second quarter was 1.2%. The solid results for the first half of the year and the rolling 12 months align with our long-term expectations for approximately one-half of 1% load growth over our five-year planning horizon. The residential sector grew 2.5% in the quarter, and 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, as our attractive service territories continue to experience new customer growth. This is particularly true in the Carolinas and Florida, where we are seeing residential customer growth of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.","Our combined gas utilities are also adding new customers at an annual rate of 1.3%. The Piedmont service territories are growing at 1.6%, with very strong growth of almost 2% in the Nashville Metro area. As we look ahead, trends in new job and wage growth, and continued recovery in the housing market, are positive signs for ongoing residential growth. We continue to see a trend of increasing single-family building permits across all of our service territories, and a decline in the starts of multi-family homes. As of May, the Southeastern states that Duke serves in, our electric and gas utilities rank among the top seven states in the country for growth in single-family building permits. In all, eight of the top 25 metro areas for growth in single-family permits are cities within Duke service territories.","During the second quarter, commercial sales across our jurisdictions improved by 0.4%, and are up 0.8% over the rolling 12 months. As we experience growth in the residential class, we see corresponding growth in related commercial businesses, such as hotels and restaurants. Even with the addition of new office space in our service areas, vacancies continue to decline, demonstrating positive signs for growth in this sector.","Turning to industrials on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector declined 0.2%. However, quarterly performance was strong for the second quarter in a row, with 0.7% growth in Q2. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continue to perform well. This strength is partially offset by the metals and auto manufacturing sectors.","As we look to the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the continued strength in industrials, as the job market remains robust and industrial production advances. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns, and we'll update you throughout the remainder of the year.","Before closing, I want to highlight a few of the key drivers for the pending rate case in our Duke Energy Progress North Carolina utility, as highlighted on slide 11. On June 1, we filed a request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission to increase revenues by $477 million for Duke Energy Progress. This is our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 2013. Since the prior rate case, we have made significant investments in new generation facilities to meet the needs of a growing customer base, and transition to a low-carbon future.","These facilities include new solar generation, highly efficient natural gas-fired units at our Sutton site, and amount spent to-date on our new Western Carolinas Modernization Project. In addition, we are seeking to recover investments required to comply with federal and state environmental regulations. These include a wastewater treatment system at our Mayo coal-fired facility, and expenses incurred to safely close our ash basins. We have also requested to include an estimate of the ongoing cost associated with ash basin closure efforts, based on actual spend in 2016. And the amount spent above or below this estimate will be deferred to a future rate case.","This approach would allow us to recover our estimated costs as incurred, reducing our financing costs and ultimately benefiting our retail customers. If approved, this will build upon the recent third quarter, allowing both the EC and the EP to recover costs for coal ash remediation from wholesale customers. We believe this was a prudent approach to managing these expenses and maintaining competitive rates for our customers. Looking ahead, intervenor testimony is due on October 20, and the hearings will begin on November 20. Under this schedule, new rates could go into effect on February 1, 2018. Also, in North Carolina, we submitted our notice to the NCUC that Duke Energy Carolinas intends to file a rate case on or about August 25. Similar to Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Carolinas has not had a rate case since 2013. Detailed information will be available when we make the full filing later this month.","I'll close with slide 12, a reminder of our attractive investor value proposition. Duke Energy's large regulated franchises and diverse investment opportunities provide balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. We are well positioned to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low risk, predictable and transparent way, providing an attractive risk-adjusted shareholder return for our investors. As a capital intensive business, our growth is supported by the scale and strength of our balance sheet. In May, Moody's changed their outlook for Duke Energy Corporation to stable from negative, and affirmed our current ratings at the holding company and subsidiaries, further validating our approach to managing the balance sheet. We remain focused on maintaining the strength for the benefit of our customers and investors. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment.","With that, let's open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Hello, Mike.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the status of legislation in North Carolina, and where you think that might be going, and what kind of timeline you might be expecting on that?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hey, Mike, we're really pleased with the H.B. 589 that we referenced on the call. This was very constructive, I think really a win-win piece of legislation, culminating from a 10-month stakeholder process, and bringing not only the opportunity for growth but reduction of cost to customers, improving reliability and opportunities for additional investment for Duke. So we see it as a demonstrated milestone for us as we continue to advance legislative initiatives in the Carolinas. As you know, additional investment around the grid remains the priority for us, and we have laid a very strong foundation in this legislative session on the compelling business case for customers, and also the case for job creation in North Carolina, and look for ways that we can continue to advance that agenda, not only in the legislature but in the regulatory arena as well. So we see 2017 as being a year that we made great progress and more to come.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And also with the PURPA reforms test, when do you expect to see maybe some additional opportunities coming from that?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","There is a procedural schedule that goes with the legislation, Mike, where we need to make a series of filings. So think about this as beginning in 2018 generally. This does represent additional investment opportunities for us in renewables which we'll evaluate carefully along with all of the other capital opportunities that we have. But we see it as a very constructive piece of legislation benefiting customers, and also creating a sustainable renewable market here in the Carolina.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So perhaps, maybe we'll see some more info on that next February. Is that in the next CapEx update?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Sure. Certainly, we'll give you an update on CapEx in 2018, and we'll continue to develop this opportunity, Mike, even between now and then. So you can think about us as looking for ways throughout all of our jurisdictions to continue to deploy capital. And this represents another opportunity that provides investors with visibility on what's possible, and we think, underpins our growth rate for the future. So we look at this as a very significant milestone for us.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Congratulations on the legislation. It's clearly a win for customers by lowering their costs, and also a win for you guys being able to participate if you can bring in competitive projects. So congrats on that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","On the rate case, you indicated we won't be getting any details on the Duke Energy Carolinas filing until further little while now. But what was the date again at which we'll be able to sort of analyze the ask (25:05) there?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Greg, it will later in August. So we typically file notice 30 days before the case is filed. That's the process here in North Carolina. Soon we (25:15) file notice late July, you'll hear more in late August.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And can we talk a little bit about the ask (25:22) and the Duke Energy Progress case? I know it's early days in your filing, and you'll be engaging with all the major parties in the case as we go through time. But the headline, increase is 14%, that's a pretty substantial number. Now, I also understand that you haven't filed a rate case in many years, and so that's a cumulative of having been away from rate filings for a while, and the fact that you've put a substantial amount of capital to work, which you deserve recovery for. But still, it's just a very large number. So can you talk about sort of how you socialize that, especially in the context of a lot of the growth capital that you've talked about related to grid modernization isn't even in this case, it's going to be in subsequent sort of future negotiations with Commission.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Greg, it's a fair question, and I would point to a couple of things on this. It's been several years since we've been in. One thing you shall notice that's not in the case is very aggressive cost management. So we've been able to deliver consistent and deliberate cost management to offset impacts to customers. And as we think about moving this case through the process, we'll also engage with stakeholders, as you referenced, to reach a settlement, if we can do that or to have good constructive discussions on how we move forward. So we've got strong capital in here for things like the Sutton Plant and new solar, and we also have investments in the Western Carolina Modernization Project, which has been strongly supported here in the Carolinas, and of course, coal ash. So I think we have a demonstrated record. If you look at the way we've approached the rate cases in this state, really in every state we operate in; bringing people together to come up with a solution that works for customers and investors will ultimately be our objective, and I believe the Commission as well, finding that right balance between customers and investors. So we will work this as we've worked every case, and I have confidence that we'll deliver an outcome that makes sense for both customers and investors.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And can you just refresh our memories traditionally, if there was an opportunity for settlement, that sort of what window in the case does that usually avail itself?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","I would look to kind of that October, mid-October to mid-November timeframe, Greg, for the DEP case. The procedural schedule has the hearing set for November 20. Testimony occurs kind of in that last month before the hearing. And so that's the point where you start to see the positions of the parties, and you create an opportunity to sit down and have discussions.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thank you. Have a great day.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. So we just wondered, you cited ACP as one of the drivers in the quarter, increased investment. Can you share how much you've invested to date and \u2013 prior to things getting moving?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes. We've got about $500 million invested in ACP at this point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And so that's the rate base number, effectively, that's driving the (29:01)?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the cost to achieve on Piedmont, they seem to be kind of still running at a decent clip. Give us a sense of what's still being booked there, and when does that start to fade?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That will continue to fade through 2017 and through 2018. We still have some software integration costs that we're looking at. That's the primary area, as you retire systems that Piedmont was on, convert data over into the Duke system, and do those types of software integration efforts. That's the main effort underway at this point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you think by eight \u2013 (29:49) they'll run through next year and then be small.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Jon, I would add, I think the integration of Piedmont has really been a textbook integration, very smooth. The business continues to run very well. And, given our track record here of a number of mergers over time, we've developed a playbook that we've effectively executed here. So I'm really pleased with where we are in the integration.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you for that.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next one from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, quick question on the rate case, Duke Energy Progress rate case. Is the ROE something that would also be up for discussion, in terms of the 10.75%, or you think that one is more set and really not up for debate?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, ROE is always up for discussion. Our allowed ROE today is 10.2%. We believe, in a rising interest rate environment, the 10.75% is a dependable ask, but ROE is always a topic of discussion, and will be in this case.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And the rising interest rate environment is more based on projections of where you see rates going over time. Is that how they will look at it?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","That's correct.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Got you. And the other thing I was also looking at was the holding company debt. I think one of the slides in the back you have the issuances, and there seems to be more to be issued in this year. So it's from slide, I think, 25. Just wanted to understand, like what is the percentage target, I guess, in terms of holding company debt as a proportion to total for this year? And then, is there any concern from a notching (31:50) perspective in terms of credit ratings, where agencies are limiting or saying that, hey, above a certain level, there could be a notching (31:59) implication on the rating?","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Yes, Praful. As we put forth in February, we expect the holding company debt to be in the mid-30s percentage of total company debt this year. And over our five-year plan, it will crest around the mid-30s percentage and start to come down a bit in the low to mid-30s percentage by the end of the five-year plan. And we've been very transparent with the rating agencies about that. We think with our low-risk profile of our businesses that certainly is comfortable for our credit ratings, and our rating agencies have agreed with us on that. Regarding our holding company position for this year, we've issued about $1 billion, a lot of it through private placement thus far through 2017. There'll be some other issuances at the holding company level that we're planning could be fairly soon in the summer.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","And Praful, I think the important point here is, if you look at where the company is positioned, coming out of all the portfolio transition that's been underway, we operate a very strong set of regulated utilities and low-risk jurisdictions with visible capital investment that we have a demonstrated track record of completing. We've been very transparent with the agencies on our capital plans, and they're comfortable with where we are. The recent action on Moody's is an indication of that. And so there's nothing in this financing plan that's a change in the way we're managing the business. And we'll intend to execute our strategic plan in growing the company and maintaining balance sheet strength.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. And just finally, I mean, you guys have a pretty good perspective across the U.S. of load growth. So wanted to understand electrification and just electric cars, there seems to be quite a trend at least expected over time to move in that direction. Do you see that as something impacting load growth over time? Do you see that as a hope for the utility sector in terms of incremental load growth? How do you view that electrification trend, I guess?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Praful, I think it is positive. And I think it will grow over time. I don't see it as a step change though in load growth because of all the other factors impacting load, including energy efficiency and other items. But it's definitely a positive trend, and we are actively in the electrification market with a team of people working in our service territories and with vendors to find ways that we can take advantage of that opportunity.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks so much, guys.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just a question, I mean...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I want to talk Florida for a second because you're getting in the seventh to eighth innings or so with some of the gas generation development, meaning Citrus, Hines. I'm just curious how you're looking at your Florida jurisdiction in terms of; A, the need for new conventional generation; or B, a potential utility scale solar rollout in Florida. We're seeing some of your peers in Florida, the regulated companies actually do a sizeable amount of annual investing in utility-scale solar. Just curious if your customer base and if the regulator and the intervenors who talk to you down there, kind of have an appetite for that for Duke Energy Florida?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Michael, I feel like we have a wealth of opportunities in Florida. You may remember that we're under a settlement agreement that runs through January 1, 2019. And so the team is very actively looking at the next wave of investments to deliver customer benefits. We think renewables will be a part of that. You may have noticed in our 10-year site plan, we have like 750 megawatts of solar on our agenda. But we also see additional growth investment potential in Florida. So that work is underway. And as we continue to mature those ideas and reach a timeframe where it makes sense to talk about it more specifically, we'll do that. But we see great opportunity in Florida, and really pleased with the rebound in the economy there. But the growth that Steve highlighted just underscores the strong and growing jurisdictions in which we operate.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you and much appreciated.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I know it's early but...","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. (36:51) what you see the opportunity around Bill 589, and do you think, is that incremental capital or would that displace other capital?","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Paul, one way to think about it is, there's about 3,000 megawatts or so of solar in that legislation. We have an ability to compete for 30% of that, and we have the ability to buy beyond that 30%, and flow those costs through a rider, which gives us timely investment recovery. In our five-year plan, we have something like $400 million of capital directed towards that type of investment in the Carolinas. So we do have more investment opportunities than we imagined (37:38), and our role will be to look at those investment opportunities, compare to alternatives and do as much as we can in a way that delivers great returns. So I see it as a growing list or great opportunities to deploy capital that underpins confidence and the ability to grow 4% to 6%.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no more questions in queue.","Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating today. We'll have a chance to see many of you over the next month or so, and look forward to a good third quarter. Of course, the IR team is available this afternoon if there are any further questions and I appreciate your interest and your investment in Duke Energy. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call, and thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
