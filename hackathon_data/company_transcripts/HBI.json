Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. HanesBrands delivered solid first quarter results with respect to revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. We're encouraged by our start to the year. That said, we have three-quarters remaining and we're staying focused on executing our long-term strategy, while also delivering short-term results. Several years ago, we began a focused strategy to diversify beyond being simply a U.S. business with a global supply chain to becoming a worldwide business that fully leverages the power of our global supply chain. Over this time, we've built a leadership position in our two core categories around the world. We have also expanded our distribution to include online, continuing our commitment to offer our products everywhere our consumers wish to purchase them.","Our diversification actions have reduced our dependency on the U.S. wholesale market, while at the same time, providing us multiple paths to deliver more consistent organic growth. In the quarter, we saw further evidence that our revenue diversification efforts are taking hold. Organic sales increased 1% in constant currency driven by strong growth across three of our key initiatives: International, Champion and online. This growth more than offset the expected brick-and-mortar declines within the U.S. wholesale channel.","Looking at our sales by product category, global underwear sales increased 2% in the quarter driven by exchange rates and the addition of Bras N Things. On an organic constant currency basis, sales declined roughly 3%. In March, we launched our Comfort Flex Fit innovation in U.S. men's underwear with a coordinated media campaign during the NCAA basketball tournament and we're pleased with the initial sales trends we're seeing from this new innovation.","We also increased our media spend during the quarter to support our new Bonds product line in Australia as well as our U.S. Intimates business. Our U.S. Intimates business, while down compared to last year, performed as expected. More specifically, our U.S. bra business, where our turnaround initiatives are more advanced, was down 2% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from the 5% decline in the fourth quarter. We're beginning to see early signs of sales and market share stabilization in our bra business, which we credit to the new programs we have placed at key strategic retailers. We're encouraged by the improved point-of-sale trends where we have placed these programs, and we believe we are on track for continued sequential improvement in our U.S. Intimates business as the year progresses.","Global Activewear sales increased 15% over last year or 8% on an organic constant currency basis. This was ahead of our expectations, as we benefited from the earlier placement of some of our spring product offerings for Champion. For the quarter, our Champion revenue grew 17% globally in constant currency, with high single-digit growth in the U.S. and strong double-digit growth in both Asia and Europe. The global growth in Champion more than offset the anticipated space reduction in our Hanes casualwear business within the U.S. mass channel.","Our Activewear strategy for the past several years has been to drive revenue and margin growth by focusing on the branded segments of the market, while de-emphasizing the commodity segments. This brand-focused strategy has been working in both our domestic and our international businesses. Going forward, we'll continue to concentrate on the higher-return segments and channels of the market by leveraging our strong brands, Champion and Hanes, as well as our latest addition, the Alternative brand.","Turning to acquisitions, Alternative Apparel is performing well and though it wasn't part of our company a year ago, revenue was up 8% over last year. Alternative adds another solid brand to our portfolio, one with a strong millennial and sustainability appeal. While we have only owned Bras N Things for roughly two months, it's an extremely well-run business and is shaping up to be a great acquisition. We've inherited a strong management team, a leading brand in Australia with a core millennial customer base, and a demonstrated omni-channel model. As we committed last quarter, we expect to complete the integrations of our current deals by the end of 2019, at which time we expect to have no more charges related to our prior acquisitions.","Touching briefly on capital allocation, our plan for this year is to digest our acquisitions and pay down debt with a focus on getting back within our targeted leverage range of two to three times net debt-to-EBITDA.","So in closing, we're encouraged by the solid start to the year, but recognize we have work to do. We're looking forward to seeing many of you at our headquarters in two weeks for our Investor Day, where you'll get a chance to interact with many of our global business leaders. You'll also hear about our strategies to unleash our full potential to generate shareholder returns as we leverage everything we have been building over the past several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. Let me begin by highlighting that today's commentary regarding operating profit and operating margin reflects the accounting rule change regarding pension expense, as well as our segment allocation change as it relates to certain corporate overhead costs. All prior-period results reflect these changes, and we've provided a table on our Investor Relations website that recast 2016 and 2017.","For the quarter, sales were $1.47 billion, an increase of $91 million over last year and up 1% organically in constant currency. Operating profit of $166 million and operating margin of 11.3% were both modestly ahead of our expectations. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.26 and $0.22 respectively, and cash flow from operations was a use of $128 million.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 6.6% over last year and included $32 million from the contributions of our recent acquisitions of Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things as well as a $45 million benefit from the effects of foreign exchange rates.","Gross margin declined 10 basis points over last year, modestly below our outlook for a slight increase, as expansion in our international gross margin was offset by higher input costs, which were expected. I will note that we experienced $14 million of raw material inflation in the quarter. Absent this inflation, our gross margin would have been up 80 basis points. Operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to last year. Absent the impact from raw material inflation, operating margin would have been up 30 basis points. Other factors weighing on our operating margin in the quarter were the anticipated increases in both media investments and distribution costs. For the quarter, our media investment was $5 million higher than last year, driven by the items Gerald referenced in his comments, while distribution costs were impacted by the short-term labor inefficiencies we spoke about last quarter.","Looking at the second half, we've secured the planned price increases for this year that we spoke about on our last call. We have begun to communicate our planned price increases for 2019 and we're progressing on our plans to improve distribution efficiencies, all of which gives us confidence that we are on track to return to operating margin expansion in the second half.","Our 16% tax rate in the quarter was in line with our expectations and included $4 million of one-time expense related to a tax law change in one of our foreign jurisdictions. GAAP EPS of $0.22 increased 16% over last year as we incurred much lower acquisition and other related charges. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 declined 10% versus last year. Now, given the recent U.S. tax reform, I would note that if the prior year's tax rate was at 16%, our adjusted EPS would have been consistent year-on-year. For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges were $20 million, a decrease of $19 million from last year. We continue to expect 2018 charges to be $80 million.","We are on track to complete the integrations of our current deals over the next 18 months and expect 2019 to mark the end of one-time charges related to all of our prior acquisitions. Consistent with our normal seasonality, cash flow from operations was a use in the quarter and was in line with our expectation. I would note, first quarter's cash flow from operations included $28 million for the previously disclosed earn-out payment related to our acquisition of Champion Europe.","Now let me take you through our segment performance. U.S. Innerwear sales declined 3% compared to last year as both Basics and Intimates were in line with our expectations. Intimates sales declined approximately 7%, while Basics sales were down just under 1%. On a rolling 12-month basis, we believe we gained market share in Basics, driven by men's underwear and socks as we outperformed the overall decline in the category.","Point-of-sale trends within Basics were better-than-expected in the mass channel and mixed in the department store and mid-tier channels. Innerwear operating margins declined approximately 240 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the impact from higher raw material costs as well as lower sales volume.","Turning to U.S. Activewear, sales increased 6% over last year due to the $16 million contribution from Alternative Apparel and a 1% increase in organic sales. The increase in organic sales exceeded our expectations as growth in Champion and replenishment Activewear more than offset the expected space declines in our mass business that Gerald referred to earlier.","With respect to Champion, sales outside of the mass channel increased over 50% in the quarter driven by strong consumer demand, space gains in the specialty channels and growth in the online channel. This more than offset a decline in the Champion mass business, which we believe is mature.","Activewear operating margins declined 210 basis points in the quarter to 11.1% as favorable product mix was more than offset by the impact from higher raw material and distribution costs. As we discussed last quarter, through pricing and distribution efforts, we expect these particular headwinds to be mitigated in the second half.","In our International segment, sales increased 19% or $92 million with $16 million from the contribution of Bras N Things and $45 million from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, organic sales increased approximately 7% compared to last year and exceeded our expectations. The primary driver of that performance was strong demand for our Champion brand, particularly in Asia where sales grew 30% and in Europe where sales grew 23% versus last year. Growth in both regions was broadbased including online, our retail stores and wholesale.","International operating margins were strong, increasing 250 basis points over last year, primarily due to scale efficiencies, favorable mix and the continued realization of acquisition synergies. As we have discussed before, over time, we expect these same factors to drive further margin expansion in the International segment. With respect to leverage, we ended the quarter at 3.9 times on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis. As Gerald discussed, we plan to de-lever this year and expect to be approaching the high end of our target range by year-end. In 2019, we expect to be back within our leverage range.","Lastly, as it relates to guidance. We reiterated our full year outlook as well as issued second quarter guidance, so I'll point you to the press release and the FAQ document for any specifics. With respect to the second quarter, our outlook included the headwinds from raw material inflation, increased media investments and higher distribution costs that we discussed on last quarter's call. These are being partially offset by synergies and cost initiatives as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions.","Our second quarter outlook also assumes that organic revenue on a constant currency basis declines less than 1% at the midpoint, reflecting our expectation for a decline in U.S. Innerwear as well as the shift of certain seasonal Champion programs into the first quarter that Gerald highlighted in his earlier remarks.","So in closing, we delivered a solid quarter. While we remain cautious with respect to the U.S. wholesale environment, we're encouraged that our efforts to diversify our business continue to gain traction. Looking out over the next several quarters, we remain focused on returning to more consistent organic growth and margin expansion, completing our ongoing integrations and reducing our debt.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Gerald, I guess for you, if you could talk through \u2013 the revenues look to be stabilizing here, but as it relates to Champion, could you guys maybe quantify \u2013 it sounds like there's a little bit of a shift into 1Q. And then just more broadly what you're seeing from the Champion line on a global basis.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure and good morning, Eric. Very solid quarter for us. We really think that the year and certainly this quarter are playing out as we expected. And as you noted, Champion has been one of our key initiatives from the standpoint of creating growth for the business, and we've got a great story going here. We reunited the brand over the last few years and saw really strong growth in Champion across the world up 22%, 17% in constant currency; 8% in the U.S., 30% in Asia and 22% in Europe, so just really solid growth across the world in this business. And it's not just wholesale. It's online and it's in our own stores, particularly in Asia and Europe. So, we've really got broad growth coming through the business, and we see a real avenue for continued growth as we look forward.","It's in the heritage products, but importantly, it's also in our performance products. They're also performing well. So, we've got a broad product line initiative as well in the brand. And we're really seeing a lot of momentum out of our consumer engagement efforts as well as we bring the consumer, a younger consumer, into the franchise in particular. So really good momentum and really seeing a lot of the results of what we set out to build a couple years ago. So feeling really good about it.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then if I could just follow up as it relates to the raw material input cost inflation. I appreciate, it sounds like you guys are relatively locked in for the year. But as we think about the price increases, maybe just walk through where we should be seeing those, sort of the elasticity assumptions that you all might have within the various segments. I'm assuming it's within the Champion, but if it is within the domestic Innerwear, how you guys think about that elasticity.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, Eric, thanks for the question. This is Barry. Raw materials really playing out very much in line with our expectations. We thought the year would have a net impact net of pricing of $30 million to $35 million of raw material impact, and that's what we see today. I noted the amount we incurred in the first quarter which was about $14 million. And that's broad based as it relates to commodities and things of that nature.","As it relates to the pricing, for 2018 that we talked about on our last call that we were working to communicate, that's all secured at this point. You're right, you know the business well. You would expect those to be in kind of the seasonal program with some of the Champion. As we look out into 2019, we've begun communicating the pricing actions that we'll take to offset the rest of this inflation, and we would expect to have those in place in early 2019. And that's really across the rest of the business. I would note if you think about the total net impact that we're incurring this year as compared to our cost of goods sold for the company, it's a relatively small impact but we will be pricing for it. And that's something the company has done for many years.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Nice job on the quarter. Good to see the top-line inflect. I was wondering in Innerwear, can you give some more color on the women's Intimates, how much was driven by the door closures versus just weak sales in existing doors? And then how much was shapewear and panties down? I think you said bras were down minus 2%.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Susan. From the standpoint of Intimates, as you know, this category has been challenging for some time. It's one that is more heavily distributed in the department store and mid-tier channels, and it's been most affected by door closures. First, I would tell you that we're encouraged that we see the category stabilizing as we overlap door closures, and that's a very positive sign to us. We have been positioning ourselves to return to growth for a period of time as well. We have been building our online business, and our shares there are equal in size to our brick-and-mortar shares.","Importantly, we have been rebuilding our mid-tier and department store business within the doors and with the accounts that remain. And we spoke as early as Q4 about some of our Maidenform initiatives and, then in Q1, we focused on Bali and putting advertising behind that. We're seeing progress out of both of those, and certainly those are important drivers of the sequential improvement in the bra performance.","Within this quarter, we also launched a number of our Maidenform initiatives, in particular in the mass channel. We're seeing nice traction there early on from a POS standpoint. So all of this tells us that we're moving in the right direction, and we see our share stabilizing as well. It also tells us that we're gaining ground on our problem.","Now when we look at Q3 and beyond, shapewear is the next area of focus for us, and we have a number of resets around those businesses in the third quarter that will then correct that piece of the business we feel. So we do feel that we're on track to deliver on the sequential improvement we expect out of the Intimates business through the year.","Susan Anderson - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then in Activewear, I think you mentioned constraints in the mass channel, which it sounds like just a mature business assuming obviously there's tough compares from last year. Maybe if you could also give some color, though, just on the sporting goods channel and department stores, are you seeing any space gains there? Or how the Champion product's performing there? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Oh yeah, we're seeing space gains across the board in Champion outside of the mass channel, and certainly it's a very strong performance in the specialty channel as well as department store and sporting goods. And so there's just nothing but good things to say about the Champion business. And outside of mass, we're looking at a 50% increase in the U.S. market in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Chethan Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. So I actually just want to follow up on that same comment on the U.S. mass channel for Champion, which I think is concentrated largely with one customer and the idea of it being mature. Can you just help us think about the long-range growth assumptions that you have for that business and also remind us how much of U.S. Champion is currently sold from the mass channel?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, from the standpoint of the mass initiatives, that was one of our early growth drivers in our Champion business. It's a great partnership. It's been built as a partnership for many years, over 15 years in the market, and has some of its best product line ever out now, and the productivity continues to improve. So we feel really good about that program and expect to feel good about it for many years to come.","From the standpoint of the total Champion brand, though, the Champion brand has evolved significantly over time from the standpoint of the many avenues it has to grow. So today, roughly, 80% of that business is outside of the mass channel around the world, and we are seeing double-digit growth, as you heard, high-teen growth outside the mass channel. So over time, the math would suggest that we would mix more into those other channels and mass will become a smaller piece of the total business.","Chethan Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. And then just a quick follow up on M&A. I think you've talked about getting back to the high-end of your net leverage range by the end of the year and being within the range next year. Should we think about a pause in M&A as you focus on kind of taking down leverage, or are you going to be similarly opportunistic if deals come up as we've seen in the past?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Over the past \u2013 let me just say first that acquisitions remain an important part of our long-term strategy. Now we have made 10 acquisitions since 2013 as a strategy to diversify our business, including two in the past six months. And that's allowed us to become less dependent on the U.S. wholesale market and establish multiple paths for consistent organic growth that you're seeing the power of now through the last three quarters. We're really comfortable with these acquisitions that we made and believe we've positioned our portfolio well as well as created substantial value for our shareholders.","But as we've executed this diversification strategy, we've gotten outside of our leverage range. So our focus in the near term is to integrate these acquisitions. We have six integrations underway right now, and as we do, we'll reduce the charges from these acquisitions, recognize the synergies, and let the full cash flow show through. We plan to, at the same time, to pay down our debt to get back within our leverage target and we expect to be within that leverage range in the latter half of 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is now open.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Gerald, Barry and T.C. Congratulations on a good quarter. Gerald, could you please quantify the early placement of Champion in the first quarter, what was pulled from 2Q into 1Q?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. This is Barry. I can take that one. We estimate that it was about $15 million on a worldwide basis because some of that was even on the international side. And while I'm talking about that, I'd just note that FX did also come in a little better than we thought. So that was about $7 million to $8 million versus what we had put into the guidance for the first quarter. Not a lot of profit on that, I might add. And as you note, the U.S. dollar has strengthened some here recently, so our foreign exchange tailwind to sales is unchanged in the guidance for the full year.","And then our Bras N Things acquisition came in just close \u2013 slightly earlier than we thought, so we got a little bit more revenue from that. So if you \u2013 absent those items and the seasonal Champion item that you asked about and FX is really a timing item within the year, so to speak. Absent those items, we really were at the high end of our first quarter sales guidance, and we feel very good about how the year has begun.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","That's very helpful. And inventory was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk a little bit about how the mix is there, how comfortable you are in aggregate inventory level?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question because I do want to clarify that some. If you look at our inventory over last year, couple of things that I would want to call out. Foreign exchange essentially justifies the entire increase. If not for FX rates, inventory would have been essentially flat. And then acquisitions contributed about $25 million to inventory year-over-year with the two deals we've done. So our base inventory, if you look at it, is actually down, and we feel good about the progress we're making there from \u2013 when I look at cash cycle, our inventory days improved to about five days, and that's good improvement. We've got more opportunity there over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Nancy Hilliker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. This is Nancy on for Ike. I know you mentioned a little bit about Activewear in the U.S. mass business, but can you just talk about your outlook for the U.S. mass business more broadly, including Innerwear and how you see Activewear playing out for the rest of the year? And then if you could just talk about global Champion, how big is it today, where can it go? Just talk about the sustainability of Champion on a global basis.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Let me begin with the mass question. From the standpoint of our mass Innerwear business, it continues to perform very well. We continue to expand the shares in areas such as our basics that we commented in our call. From the standpoint of the Activewear business, there was some space adjustment in our Hanes Activewear business in the quarter that was built into our guidance. And it's really part of our strategy to focus on the branded segments of Activewear and deemphasize commodity elements. And there was a portion of that business that was more basic tees and so forth, and we were aware that our customer would be moving that segment to private label. So it is in line with our expectations from the standpoint of guidance.","From the standpoint of Champion, as I noted, Champion has many growth avenues beyond the mass channel now. We expect the growth really to come from those channels as we go forward, and mass will become a smaller share of the total Champion business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. For those of us sitting here in the United States with limited visibility abroad, can you just give us some additional color around the drivers of the 7% organic constant currency growth and the runway for those businesses going forward? Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. When we look at our International business, really \u2013 and Gerald highlighted this in some of his prepared remarks, it's much about Champion. It's broad-based, but Champion is growing very well across the world, whether it be in Europe or Asia, and that is the principal driver of the growth, and we feel very good about how that started the year and opportunity going forward.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Westcott Rochette with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Westcott Rochette - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys. There's been a lot of discussion in private label. You mentioned it on the call with your Activewear. As you think about your different categories and your major players, how do you feel the balance of private label is to your categories now, whether it be the socks on Amazon? And how you feel the category is progressing on that front? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. From the standpoint of private label, there's always been an element of private label in our categories, and it's an effort that retailers take from time-to-time to differentiate themselves. Now we've always noted our categories are heavily branded, and in a category like Innerwear they tend to be 80% to 90% branded. Interestingly enough we're just doing some work that we'll talk more about in our Investor Day, that over the last five years we looked across geographies, the branded element has actually grown, and private label has declined in Innerwear across multiple geographies.","So I think that speaks to the strength of brands, and we see that as the Millennials come on as consumers, they prefer brands equally to boomers, and so we're continuing to focus on connecting with that emerging consumer base through our marketing and media as well as our consumer-driven innovation, and continue to drive our brand shares.","On the Activewear side, we have taken the approach of focusing on the branded segments of Activewear and de-emphasizing the commodity segments over time, and I think there you see the power of our Champion initiative as well as our adding a brand like Alternative really give us a number of tools to bring that strategy to bear. And our shares are growing, and we think our consumer equities are building. When we look at our brands, they're equally strong among the younger consumer and the older consumer, and it's clear to us that brands matter in our categories and we've got a great portfolio to compete with.","Westcott Rochette - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. That's great. And just one more question on where you feel the channel is on inventory levels and destocking? It's been an issue kind of in the past, and I know the mass channels continue to be focused on it. Do you feel that's stabilized, or is there more kind of legs to go?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","We do feel that the mass channel is stabilized. We've seen that channel very effectively tighten their inventory behind over the last few years to get that in line, and we think it is in line. They've improved their turns very dramatically and are very effective now at managing their inventory, and we think it's well positioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Krista Zuber - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Krista on behalf of John. Two questions. I think you previously guided fiscal 2018 gross margin expansion to up about 100 basis points to 200 basis points. It looks like in the Frequently Asked Question document it's around 100 basis points now. So that sort of implies quite an outside gain in the second half. I wonder if you could share with us kind of the various components that will drive that expansion, be it IMU, the supply chain benefits you're expecting, et cetera? And then I have one follow up. Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Sure. This is Barry. Thanks for that question. In the first quarter, the gross margin was down very slightly about 10 basis points and not a significant variance really to what we were expecting, we saw a little bit of an earlier raw material, but not much change in the relative mix of the business either versus what we were thinking. When you look out over the course of the rest of the year and you get a little bit better International mix. Of course we have larger contribution from our new acquisition Bras N Things, which has a very nice gross margin in that business.","We start to see the benefit later in the year of the pricing that we spoke about. That's all secured. That starts to help offset the inflation that we've talked about. And those would be sort of the principal drivers. You also of course will expect to see some more synergy benefit that will play out largely in the International segment. As we talked about before, we feel very good about seeing those International margins meet, or in fact, exceed the corporate average over time as the synergies continue to play out. And then I'll just note that in the second half, we certainly expect to see the total company's operating margin expand. So we feel good about how that's playing out at this stage.","Krista Zuber - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then how should we think about innovation or your launch cadence in Innerwear and Activewear in the second half of 2008 (sic) [2018], especially as it relates to your back-to-school strategy? Thank you.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we made a pretty big innovation launch in March, and that was our Comfort Flex Fit underwear launch and you'll see that as an important part of our focus through back-to-school as well; very impactful campaign, supported by digital activities and influencers. And we're seeing nice traction out of that launch, and we will continue to ramp that through the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could just touch base on the labor inefficiencies; what you've done thus far to fix the problem and how you think you, I guess, can put up better margins in the fourth quarter as you go against those. What are you doing with your workers to be more efficient? Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. A couple of questions there that I'll unpack. What we're experiencing right now is the fact that the Champion demand is so strong, as Gerald mentioned, outside of mass growing 50% or more in the U.S. that we have some temporary labor inefficiencies in the distribution centers. And so we are staffing. We've been staffing up with some temporary and moving to permanent. We're also working to expand the network, and all of that is in process. We talked about some of that on the last call. And that's one of the reasons why we think we will get this behind us here in the first half and begin to have that be less of an impact if not no impact in the second half.","The other element that you mentioned in the fourth quarter that impacted us on distribution costs that we talked about before was in the factor that we were seeing some retailers move their orders closer to promotional periods. And that was something that impacted us in the fourth quarter as we had the holiday and as we talked about last quarter, we certainly expect to have the staffing in an optimal position in front of all holidays going forward. So, I think we're in a good place as it relates to the work we're doing there.","Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then just a follow up on an earlier question with regards to the gross margin guidance. The fact that last quarter you said 100 basis points to 200 basis points and now you're saying up 100 basis points, do you think you could still hit the high end of the expectation you, I guess, provided last quarter? Or are there some new incremental headwinds on that line? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, so we said I think in the FAQ at least 100 basis points and not to parse it too tightly, I would just note, looking in the first quarter on the original guidance, we were suggesting that it would be up \u2013 I believe I used the word slightly on the last call, which was in the vicinity of 10 basis points or 20 basis points and we came in about 10 basis points down. So not a big variance, but as you work through the year, since we weren't adjusting the guidance much, we did take the opportunity to just note that we think the gross margin would be up at least 100 basis points. Is it conceivable it could be up more than that? Certainly, we used the words deliberately as it relates to at least. So we feel good about the fact that we've secured the pricing that we've talked about. We have nice synergies coming through the model. We've got that mix that I mentioned before. And I think we've got the raw material called appropriately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, on SG&A, it looks like about $5 million of first quarter's SG&A from last year was moved down to the other expense line. Maybe you can parse out further the driver for this decision. And then second, should we assume about $5 million of SG&A per quarter for 2017 to create an apples-to-apples comparison?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, so on our last call, we did mention that we were adjusting pension expense for the change in FASB and accounting rules related to pension. So that is now in other, and we had disclosed that I believe in our K and the recasted historical financials reflect that. So you should expect, that's correct, that I think our total pension last year was about $20 million. And that's essentially on a quarterly basis. So you are right.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. And then second question, I wanted to follow up on the reiterated full year cash flow from operations guide. I think cash flow from operations was down $128 million for the quarter due to various puts and takes. Curious to know if you have any directional guidance and if we should see the second quarter cash flow from operations up relative to last year? Or should we see it more back-end weighted?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Cash flow from operations for the company is playing out just as we expected. Q1 was very much in line with our expectations. So we continue to expect the full year to be in the $675 million to $750 million for the full year. I would note that the first quarter cash flow from operations does include that earn-out payment on the Champion Europe acquisition due to the way accounting treatment (39:37) working capital. And so as I look at the full year, we certainly would expect the second quarter to be sort of typical seasonality. We don't see any variance. So you'd have naturally more of the cash flow in the back half as you know the company well. But broadly speaking, working capital in the first quarter was just as planned and seasonal. We had that few days of improvement in cash cycle from the inventory that I mentioned, and we feel good about the cash flow from operations for the year.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is May (40:19) in on for Carla. We just wanted a little bit more clarity on the distribution cost that you highlighted. Is there anything of note that we should know about? Was it, like, shipping costs? Or was it driven by an increase in Champion sales or anything like that? And I know that you mentioned that it's going to normalize in 2Q or later this year. Should that be relatively even?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify some of that. When we're talking about distribution in this case, it's really inside our distribution centers and within our network. It's not in the form of freight, although we do see a little bit of kind of ocean freight, et cetera, being a factor. However, from a distribution standpoint, really we're talking about the labor-driven inefficiencies we talked about earlier on the call and last quarter. And as it relates to how that will even out, we really do expect there to still be \u2013 and it's embedded in the guidance \u2013 some elevated level of distribution cost here in the second quarter, and by the back half, it to be more normalized to levels that are embedded in the guide.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Robillard for any closing remarks.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. T.C. Robillard. Sir, please go ahead.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands' quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the third quarter of 2018. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release, updated FAQ document and a replay of this call can be found in the Investors section of our hanes.com website.","On the call today, we may make forward-looking statements, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.

Additional information, including the reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release.","With me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Chief Financial Officer. For today' call, Gerald and Barry will provide some brief remarks. And then, we'll open it up to your question.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. As we review the highlights of our third quarter results, Barry and I will exclude the impact from the recent Sears bankruptcy, which will allow for a more relevant comparison to our prior guidance and provide increased clarity on the underlying performance of the business.","Total company results were in line with our guidance, benefiting from our business diversification. We continue to make progress toward our long-term goals with a fifth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth, improved profit margins, reduced leverage and continued strong sales growth of Champion around the globe.","We believe we are poised to deliver full-year results in line with our expectations coming into 2018, based on our fourth quarter view of the continued strong performance in our Activewear and International businesses, combined with the positive underlying consumer trends in our Innerwear business.","Revenue in the third quarter experienced greater-than-expected FX pressure, but still met the low end of our range. Organic sales increased over 1% in constant-currency, driven by better-than-expect performance in Champion across both our Activewear and International segments.","While we were disappointed that our Innerwear segment had lower-than-expected results, there were a number of positive consumer signals in the quarter that point to improved revenue trends in the fourth quarter.","Our gross and operating margins increased over prior year and the strong margin performance drove operating profit and earnings per share to the midpoint of our guidance range.","We also generated over $200 million in cash flow from operations, which was used in part to pay down debt, lowering our leverage to 3.8 times on a net-debt-to-EBITDA basis.","Touching on our business segments; for the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 7%, below our outlook for 1% to 2% decline. Our U.S. Innerwear results were particularly frustrating this quarter, as our replenishment orders lagged, despite experiencing some of the strongest point-of-sales results across our categories that we've seen in years. This imbalance between point-of-sale and shipments, particularly within panties and socks, accounted for the vast majority of the sales shortfall relative to our outlook.","Within our basics business, we believe our fundamentals remain strong. Point-of-sale increased in the low to mid-single digit rate, each month during the quarter.","Men's underwear revenue grew 5% as innovation drove market share gains and our shipments matched our point-of-sale. And then, in panties and socks, where we saw the majority of the shipment and balance, point-of-sale increased to the mid to high single-digit rates in the quarter.","Within Intimates, we're seeing incremental signs that our revitalization plan is gaining traction, albeit at a more uneven pace than we've been anticipating. Our market share is beginning to stabilize after multiple quarters of decline. And point-of-sale trends are rebounding within the key accounts where we have re-launched with new product offerings.","Most recently, we've seen progress in shapewear, where we introduced product resets in late August in two key accounts. Since the reset, we have experienced low double-digit point-of-sale growth as consumers reacted positively to our new product designs and innovation.","While early, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reception and we plan to roll these innovations out to other retailers in the first half of 2019.","Based on our bookings for the first two weeks of October, we expect Innerwear sales in the fourth quarter to be flat with prior year. This marks a significant improvement from third quarter's performance, and there are two trends driving this outlook. First, our point-of-sale strength continued through October. Second, we're seeing alignment between our point-of-sale and our shipments across basics, specifically within panties and socks.","As we look to 2019, we expect the Innerwear business to be essentially flat, reflecting expanding shelf space in basics, the benefit from price increases, which have already been accepted by retailers, a conservative view on elasticity, as well as the complete removal of Sears from our forward outlook.","Now let me discuss the strong performance of the Activewear and International segments in the quarter. On an organic basis, Activewear revenue increased nearly 4% and International segment sales increased 10% in constant-currency. Organic growth in both segments accelerated in the quarter, and results were above the high-end of our expectations; driven primarily by the continued strength of Champion globally.","As I did last quarter, I'll first discuss our Champion results, excluding the mass channel. For the quarter, Global Champion sales grew 40% in constant-currency and operating margins continued to expand. Sales growth in the quarter was broad-based, up double-digits in all regions. We also saw growth across global channels of trade, including wholesale, owned-retail and online.","On our trailing 12 month basis, sales were over $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter and we expect full-year Champion sales outside of the mass channel to exceed $1.3 billion. Even though, we're cycling tougher comparisons, Champion's growth rate continues to accelerate, with this quarter's 40% growth coming on top of last year's 33% increase.","In fact, over the past five quarters, constant-currency growth has been up 33%, up 29%, up 32%, up 39% and up 40%. This is a clear indication that our coordinated global strategy to elevate the Champion brand is driving increased demand for the product.","And based on our bookings, we expect strong double-digit growth to continue through the first half of 2019, putting us ahead of schedule in achieving our $2 billion revenue goal.","Touching briefly on our Champion at mass business, sales in the quarter were up mid-single digits compared to last year, while on a trailing 12 month basis, sales declined at a mid-single-digit rate.","Looking forward, mass channel bookings through the first half of 2019 are essentially flat for the first half of 2018. As we get visibility into future bookings, we'll provide additional updates.","So in closing, we anticipate 2018 results to be consistent with the expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year, excluding the impact of the Sears bankruptcy. While we've made progress on many fronts, there are others that have yet to be achieved. And we recognize the importance of this, especially as it relates to the fourth quarter.","In Innerwear, our fundamentals remain strong. Innovation is working. Our market share is increasing. We've secured price increases for next year, and we're gaining shelf space in basics.","With shipment patterns aligning with point-of-sale, we expect to see improving Innerwear revenue trends in the fourth quarter and in 2019. Momentum in our Champion business continues to accelerate with bookings visibility through the first half of next year.","Our operating margin is expanding in line with our long-term goal and our leverage is coming down. As we laid out at our Investor Day, over the next five years, our business model is primed to double the amount of free cash flow that we generated in the previous five years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. Before I discuss third quarter results, I'd like to briefly touch on Sears, which represents approximately 1% of total company revenue. Our approach to accounting for the bankruptcy was to eliminate the exposure upfront.","In the third quarter, we reserved our exposure, resulting in a $14 million charge. And for our fourth quarter guidance, we took the same approach. We removed all sales to Sears Holdings from our forecast, which lowered fourth quarter revenue by $15 million and operating profit by about $5 million.","Now, let me discuss our third quarter results, excluding the bankruptcy charge, which can be seen in Table 5 of our earnings release. Overall, our results for the quarter were good. While the replenishment lag Gerald mentioned impacted our Innerwear results, we achieved or exceeded our expectations on nearly all of our other key metrics.","To highlight a few of those, organic revenue increased over 1% in constant-currency. Champion sales were above plan, which drove better-than-expected organic revenue growth in both our Activewear and International segments.","As projected, we drove increases in gross and operating margins versus the prior year. We reduced our debt and leverage, and our cash flow continued to build, even with inventory investments to support Champion stronger-than-expected growth.","For the quarter, sales were $1.85 billion, an increase of $49 million over last year. Adjusted operating profit increased 6% to $292 million, while adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.8%. Earnings per share were $0.55 and we generated over $200 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 2.7% over last year, including $48 million from the contributions of our recent acquisitions of Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things. The impact from foreign exchange lowered reported revenue by $22 million, which was $4 million worse than expected as the dollar continued to strengthen since our August guidance.","We increased gross margin by 140 basis points over last year. Favorable mix, driven principally by Champion, contributions from Bras N Things as well as the benefits from acquisition synergies and cost savings initiatives more than offset higher input costs.","Operating margin increased 50 basis points compared to last year, driven by the improved gross margin performance, partially offset by our planned investments to support our growth strategies.","For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges of $20.7 million were in line with our guidance. We continue to make good progress on our initiative to complete ongoing integrations and we project that all integration charges for prior acquisitions will end during 2019.","Now let me take you through our segment performance. As Gerald discussed, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 7%, while operating margins declined 170 basis points compared to last year, due to volume deleverage and higher input costs. U.S. Activewear segment sales increased 7% over prior year, driven by solid organic sales growth of 4%, as well as the contribution from Alternative Apparel.","Organic sales growth accelerated in the quarter, fueled by strong performance in our Champion and replenishment Activewear businesses. Activewear's operating margin of 16.9% was consistent year-over-year. Scale benefits from Champion's growth drove improved segment gross margin, which was offset by investments behind our growing Champion brand as well as a short-term dilutive effect of Alternative Apparel.","Our International segment sales increased 11%, or $63 million, which included a $32 million contribution from Bras N Things and a $22 million headwind from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On a constant-currency basis, organic sales were strong and increased 10%, or $53 million compared to last year.","Now a key highlight from me in the quarter was that our International team delivered organic growth across all of our major regions around the world, Asia, Europe and Australia.","International's operating margin increased 200 basis points over last year to 16.1% due to favorable mix, driven principally by Champion, contributions from Bras N Things as well as acquisition synergies.","Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. In the quarter, we generated $206 million of cash flow from operations. Inventory was up year-on-year, with the increase primarily due to our investment to support Champion's global growth, as well as the added balances from our recent acquisitions.","Days sales outstanding was consistent year-over-year, while our focus on both payables and inventory days resulted in a four-day improvement in our cash cycle.","We reduced debt by $115 million in the quarter and despite taking the bankruptcy charge, I referred to earlier, we were able to lower leverage to 3.8 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis.","We expect to be approaching the high-end of our target leverage range of 2 times to 3 times by year-end and to be back within our range in the second half of 2018.","Now, turning to guidance. For the full-year, if you exclude the Sears bankruptcy, which was not accounted for in our prior guidance, the midpoint of our revenue and profit ranges remains unchanged. We narrowed our revenue outlook within our prior range.","This reflects our performance year-to-date and our positive outlook for the fourth quarter, driven by growth from Champion and International. I would note that's despite an incremental $20 million headwind from foreign exchange rates since our last guidance and the removal of Sears from our fourth quarter outlook.","With respect to profit, our revised range reflects an incremental $23 million headwind from the Sears bankruptcy and foreign exchange rates. And our revised cash flow guidance reflects transitory working capital investments to support Champion's growth as well as the after-tax profit impact of Sears and foreign exchange rates.","Looking at our fourth quarter guidance; at the midpoint, our revenue outlook reflects a $29 million headwind from exchange rates, acquisition contributions of approximately $45 million and organic constant-currency growth of approximately 3.5%.","We expect U.S. Innerwear sales to be flat compared to the prior year. And I should note that's up 3%, excluding Sears from both years. U.S. Activewear organic growth is expected to be consistent with the third quarter at 4%. And on a constant-currency basis, we expect organic growth in International to be consistent with our performance year-to-date.","In terms of operating profit; at the midpoint, our fourth quarter outlook reflects 10% growth versus prior year and implies approximately 70 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by favorable mix, the contribution from Bras N Things, as well as SG&A leverage, partially offset by higher input costs.","Acquisition and other related charges are expected to be approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with our full-year outlook of $80 million. Interest and other expense in the quarter is expected to be $54 million, and our full-year guidance reflects the increasing rate environment.","As we look into 2019, at this point, we would expect interest and other expense to be roughly flat year-over-year as our aggressive debt paydown plans are offset by a conservative outlook for higher interest rates. As a reminder, about half our debt is floating. The remainder is fixed at a blended rate of 4.5%.","Lastly, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint is expected to increase 12%, when normalizing last year's tax rate to reflect the impact from tax reform.","So in closing, just a few comments as we finish the year and head into 2019. Champion's growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. And with our bookings visibility, we expect continued strong double-digit growth through the first half of the next year. In Innerwear, with shipments and point-of-sale aligning, we expect improved revenue trends in the fourth quarter.","We've locked in all of the 2019 price increases we've previously talked about, which go into effect in February. Our margins are expanding as we projected. Our cash generation is growing and we're paying down debt. Momentum is building across our business and we look forward to unlocking our full cash-flow potential in delivering higher shareholder returns over the next several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, if I could, just as it relates to the domestic Innerwear, Gerald, you mentioned just the sell-through being quite strong, which is not aligning, but feeling confident that that sort of takes hold in 4Q. Could you just provide a little bit more color in terms of the dynamic of that, and what gives you confidence that it does accelerate in 4Q?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Eric. Sure, I'd love to. When we look at our Innerwear business, in particular, and I'll be quite specific. While it was below our shipment expectations in Q3, we saw a number of positive trends, and I'll tell you, in my experience, it's some of the most positive trends I've seen across Innerwear, in quite some time, and it comes in many places.","We saw our basics POS up low to mid-single digits every month during the third quarter, we're seeing our shares grow across men's underwear, women's underwear as well as socks. And we're seeing our Intimates revitalization tactics begin to take hold, we saw a nice POS gains in the accounts where we put our shapewear, in particular, late in the quarter as well as our share within Intimates flatten out. These are all good trends that tell us that with this kind of strength that those shipments will follow.","And as we've gotten into October, that's exactly what we've seen. We've seen the POS continue to be strong, for example, in our basics business, but along with that, we've now seen the shipments aligned with that POS, and it's been particularly true in our panty and socks businesses, where we saw some of the softest shipping coming out of Q3.","So, we see that strength building, we know that our innovations are working, our Comfort Flex Fit underwear, for example, potentially exceed our expectations and you've heard my comments about underwear, POS, in particular and how strong that performed in the quarter.","We see our innovations in shapewear working. We haven't seen growth in shapewear in some time, and this POS turnaround as we've put our cooling innovations in place with shapewear really tells us we've got strength building there. So, we feel as we turn to the fourth quarter, we see the bookings that we are well positioned to deliver, a very solid fourth quarter.","And as we look beyond it, we feel good about going to next year. We can now see the momentum building, we see our shelf gains already locked in for next year in basics as well as our Intimates revitalization, we'll continue to roll forward, and we've got our prices locked in. So, we feel that the strength we're seeing in Innerwear tied to our International growth and our Activewear growth positions us well for a very solid fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hi, good morning, nice job on the quarter. I was wondering maybe if you could touch a little bit more on the Intimate performance. I guess, I was curious, did you see that weak performance in the quarter really across all the distribution channels, or was it weaker in one channel versus the other? And then, I know you mentioned the strength in October, I mean, if you could just talk about, if there's any change there? Or where you're seeing the strength across Innerwear in those channels also?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure, let me answer your Intimates question as part of probably the broader question. If I look at Innerwear in general, we've seen very solid POS across channels as we have come to the October period, it's continued, and we've seen the shipments aligned as well, including in the intimate side of things.","If I break down your question on Intimates, in particular, the shipments were lower than we had projected going into the month and there was really a couple areas as we've looked at it relative to our POS, because as you heard in my comments, we felt good about our revitalization efforts, particularly in shapewear. They did go in place later in the quarter, in late August, and so while we saw the POS come about, we did not yet see the refill behind those initiatives, and we anticipate we'll see that as we now get into the fourth quarter, and that was about half of what was lower than what we projected in Intimates.","The other half was actually that we did some trade spending with some specific accounts that we have planned in the fourth quarter, it actually occurred in the third quarter, and that spending is a net to revenue. So, that will flip around as a tailwind, as we look into the fourth quarter. So, between the refill on the Intimates POS that we expect and the flip around in that trade spending to a positive, we feel we've got nice tailwinds going into the fourth quarter for Intimates as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could we talk about the comments on Innerwear flat for next year? I think it has been running behind that for a while now and it sounds like in the mass channel to be general there, it's taken fairly big steps towards private label in some of these categories. As far as \u2013 I'm wondering, if you could just help us make sense of that narrative, and how the channel is looking at branded versus private label strategy? And what's changing, I guess versus a historical view that channel has taken in terms of brands versus private label in the past?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","As far as our channels in the Innerwear category, we're not seeing any change in the level of private label in that business. As we've said for some time, in Innerwear, the presence of private label is fairly small.","And you may recall back at our Investor Day, we looked at it across our global markets. In France, for example, between 2013 and 2017, 90% of those categories have been branded. As we look at the U.S. market, in 2013, about 18% of the business was private label and it dropped to 11% in 2017. So, we're not seeing a dramatic shift. And, in fact, the branded presence online in Innerwear is bigger at over 90%.","So, we see branded still make a big difference to a consumer. As we've also discussed, price is a distant fifth to consumers relative to their decision tree and brands is number one. So, brands are tied to fit and comfort are the critical things when we get into Innerwear. And so, we're seeing growth. As you heard me mention, we've already booked additional doors, including some new doors that we've taken from competitors early in next year in our basics business, so we feel good about the presence of brands and the ongoing need for brands in that channel.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on Michael's question. I think this morning a key competitor announced that they secured a new private label underwear program for 2019 with its largest mass retail customer.","Just curious, how should we take that into consideration with regards to Innerwear revenues guided to flat for next year? And then, if I could squeeze one more question, maybe, Barry, if you can walk us through the assumptions for cash flow for the fourth quarter, that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of our basics business in men's underwear in particular, I mentioned, we were up 5% in the quarter. We had one of our strongest share gain quarters as well as we look into the quarter in men's underwear. So, the branded nature of our business and you should think that our underwear business will continue to be very strong next year.","From the standpoint of competitors, it's difficult to speak about their particular strategies, but in many cases they are talking about space that they switch from private label to a cheap product that they put in on a brand with no awareness on and now that's gone back to private label. So, there's a lot of noise around the same space, but what we've seen is that branded shares over time have remained very strong in the basics business, particularly in underwear.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hey, Laurent. This is Barry. Good question. Thanks for that. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow is expected to be in excess of $500 million. And that, together with the year-to-date performance, would get to the midpoint of our guidance. And there's three things I would want you to think about with respect to that $500 million.","The first is, if you take the midpoint of our fourth quarter, GAAP net income plus our typical non-cash items in the fourth quarter, that's $215 million.","And then, the second thing that you should look at is, we are expecting the typical seasonal benefit that we generate from accounts receivable. And as you've seen over the last few fourth quarters of the last few years, that generates $100 million to $150 million on average.","And then, third, again, typical with normal seasonal trends, you would see over the last couple of years, inventory is a benefit of well over $100 million, and we're certainly expecting that again this year.","So, all-in, we feel very good about our ability to generate that $500 million of cash flow from operations and we feel quite good about showing the cash flow performance over the next several years as we continue to move toward our $900 million to $1 billion goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify, I didn't hear the word destocking used, but it sounds like the spread between the strong POS you're seeing and the shipments, isn't necessarily a retailer destocking issue, it's other factors. I wanted to make sure I'd clarify that point.","And then, I wanted to ask my question on Champion. Obviously, the strength there is significant. How are you thinking about building the team, accessing talent, given the long-term huge opportunity for that brand? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. I agree with you, Omar. It's not a destocking. That was a period where some of our customers were really reducing inventories and so forth. This is more what we have seen with some of our customers as they've gotten much better at their order cycles and so forth.","And from time to time, we see a fluctuation as they try to order closer to the event. So, we view it more as that, it was just merely timing. And as we can now see and particularly in socks and women's panties, as I mentioned, we've seen that rebuild. It's just more of a fluctuation and timing, so we don't view it as destocking at all. And in fact, we feel we've entered the quarter well-positioned out to deliver the fourth quarter.","From the standpoint of Champion, to your point, we couldn't be more excited. We're seeing double-digit growth around the world in our business as we mentioned at our Investor Day. We set a goal that we'd go from $1 billion of sales outside of mass to $2 billion by 2022, which was about a 15% CAGR at that point.","In my comments I mentioned that this year we would finish above the $1.3 billion number. So, I want a 30% CAGR. We're running basically twice the pace of what we said. So, we're well positioned to beat our goal of getting to that $2 billion number and to keep the momentum in the business in 2020 and beyond from the standpoint of growth. It's really exciting what's going on with that business.","So, we are continuing to invest in the business and we'll do so from a digital standpoint, something I know you've been very aware of. We'll also continue to open stores in select markets to drive our brand image. And we, of course, are staffing behind it, because it's one of our key growth initiatives over the years to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. I just want \u2013 just wanted to ask about the Australia Pac Brands business. Can you give us an update on how the integration is going, what kind of synergies you've been able to realize, and how sales growth was in the quarter for the year so far?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. We couldn't be more delighted with the Pac Brands business. We knew it was a great business when we bought it with a very solid management team. It did deliver organic growth in the quarter. The synergies continue to track to our expectations, and it's delivering in our double-digit margin range, which we had targeted as we see the synergies coming through.","The thing we also love so much about that business is it came with a very strong management team, and it allows us to build upon that management team. So, they are also managing the integration of our Bras N Things acquisition that we announced early in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On underwear, how long do they take for the shipments to catch up, I guess, to the demand that the retailer was seeing? And is it something that we can expect more as the retailers continue to manage their inventory and create more choppiness to your business? And related to that, I noticed in the FAQ today that you have some commentary around the remaining $70 million of your business at Target. And I wondered if you could explain that a little bit more?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. The cycle is pretty quick on these. We get replenishment orders every week. So, if we see a fluctuation down, it can also quickly come back up. And that's exactly what we saw in the case of those orders, and particularly, in the basics business as we entered October. So again, to the earlier answer I gave, we view this more as a short-term fluctuation. And we take orders every week and we ship orders every week, so these things correct themselves pretty quickly.","From the standpoint of the C9 business, the vast majority of that business is an Activewear business. There's a small amount of basics that's complementary to that Activewear business, about $70 million of business that the space is secured for 2019.","As we look beyond that, we anticipate that we will transition that business into our Hanes mass basics business, as well as we have a very strong growing business now in our Champion basics business that is adding space outside of the mass business, in line with our ongoing growth of the core Champion brand. So, we anticipate absorbing all that business into our other businesses in the years ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Chethan Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I want to ask about the 2019 price increases that have been accepted at retail. I think you've said in the past that these increases are expected to be a little more sizable than the increases you took in 2018, but can you just remind us of the order of magnitude there?","And then I think there was a comment about having a conservative view on elasticity. So, can you just talk about the elasticity you've seen in response to the 2018 pricing? And give a little more detail about how you're think about that for 2019? Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hey, Chethan, this is Barry. I'll take the first part of that and then let Gerald talk to the elasticity historically. You're right that we will be passing through the pricing. That's all been communicated and is in place, it will go into effect in February, so we feel very good about that. That will help offset the raw material inflation we've been absorbing this year. Those increases are kind of average 4% to 5% across the majority of our U.S. Innerwear business. Now I'd note that you're right. We did take a conservative view, at least at this point, for planning in 2019 as it relates to elasticity. Gerald, do you want to speak to historically what we've seen?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. We've traditionally seen that elasticity is less than one as we go into these types of price increases, an important part of implementing these price increases for us is to put the appropriate advertising and brand support out, during those periods of time as the prices get set in the market. And we'll, of course, do that again this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is now open.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Gerald, Barry and T.C. Two very quick questions. One is, when was the last time that constant-currency organic growth was greater than 3.5% in any quarter? And also, if you could provide a little bit of an update on C9 and your thoughts about replacing the current channel distribution, and perhaps the timing of that as well? Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","As it relates to the organic constant-currency, Steve, I think we'll \u2013 let me look at that on a quarterly basis, and get back to you, or put that in a FAQ as it relates to the specifics of that. We feel \u2013 I will tell you this, we feel very good about the fourth quarter organic constant-currency, specifically because the Champion growth we're seeing around the world is very strong. The bookings that we've got and the orders that we see for the fourth quarter continue the trajectory that we've been seeing.","And as we noted in the third quarter, there was considerable acceleration there. We also see our International business around the world continuing to build as we mentioned in the quarter, we saw very strong organic growth across all regions, so that Asia was really strong, Europe was very strong and Australia also contributing nicely.","As it relates to our U.S. business, the other thing I'll point to you is, as we've talked about this year, some of our mass space and Activewear, we were lapping some space loss and that becomes less of a headwind in the fourth quarter. So, Gerald, do you want to take the rest?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure, as you heard in my earlier comments, Steve, from the standard of our momentum in our core Champion brand, it's far exceeding our expectations at this point in time. So, we're basically growing at twice the pace that we expected and well ahead of pace at this current rate to achieve our $2 billion goal and drive momentum in 2020 and beyond from that standpoint of our Champion business.","We do have the 2020 or the Champion C9 contract until early 2020. We continue to execute against that (36:24) any discussions we're having at this point would be post that 2020 period and would only represent upside to the current momentum that we have. But we feel there's a tremendous amount of momentum in that core Champion business in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. Barry, I think two quick questions for you. You've talked about, continue to talk about getting the leverage ratio down to your targeted range by the end of next year. Can you maybe give us some color, how much EBITDA growth are you expecting next year versus how much debt paydown are you expecting within that commentary?","And then just really quick, if I'm reading this right, it looks like the acquisition revenue in the quarter was $7 million light of your plan. Just kind of curious what would happened there, if that's currency or if it's something else?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Hi, Ike, good morning. Couple of things as it relates to next year. So, as we projected at the Investor Day in terms of our base model, we were, I think, conservatively postured in that de-risked model too, relatively low organic growth and a modest operating profit improvement. And at this point, in light of the, we're not providing guidance for 2019 at this stage, but I think that we are on track or even a little bit better than that expectation, so that will be contributing to EBITDA some.","The vast majority of the debt will be \u2013 leverage improvement will be through paydown of debt, because as you look out into next year again without giving guidance, we certainly would expect our cash flow from operations to be up nicely next year. There are several add backs that we've talked about this year that are one-time impacting cash flow, for example, a couple of things to think about. We won't have that earn out payment that we had this year as well as the acquisition charges will be down appreciably, together with improvement from the standpoint of the pricing actions we've taken.","So cash flow from operations ought to be up nicely. And in light of CapEx being relatively low, kind of running in the $90 million to $100 million range, we will have a considerable amount of debt paydown next year. And so I think you should feel very good about our trajectory to get back into the range in the back half of 2019.","As it relates to the acquisition sales in a quarter, you're right, they were just a few million light, and that is really more timing than anything. We feel very good about our Bras N Things acquisition is doing phenomenal, and that business is extremely profitable and is just continuing to do very well. I think you'll see the fourth quarter is traditionally one of its strongest with holiday.","And then our Alternative Apparel business continues to perform well and we're getting nice synergies on both businesses and that contributes to the margin improvement we've been seeing. So, we feel good about them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. I want to touch on a phrase you used. Can you dig further into these positive consumer signals that you've mentioned in terms of Innerwear potentially turning the corner? I'd love some granularity as to what they are to the extent that it wasn't covered and what you've already said specifically about your segment this morning.","And also, could you discuss in more detail what triggered the reduction in your full-year gross margin guidance, despite the 140-basis-point gain in the third quarter? Are there specific drivers you can highlight that have changed in your view? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, let me start with the consumer signals part and I'll turn it to Barry for the second half. From the consumer signals, it's really, what I referenced early. I'm seeing trends that are strongest I've seen in quite some time in our Innerwear business. And there are things like POS, low to mid-single digit POS across so many segments of our basics. Every month within a quarter and into the balance, frankly, into the back end of the second quarter are really strong trends and we're seeing that continue into the October month, as we mentioned earlier.","The rebounding in Intimates as we got our innovations in place, the return in the business, particularly in shapewear to positive POS growth in our core accounts, where we did the innovations is something we haven't seen in some time.","Our market shares were up nicely across our men's underwear, our women's underwear, as well as our family socks businesses, reinforcing the strength that that POS is going through and showing up in the way consumers report their purchases.","And so, all of those are very positive trends that are now linked as we look forward with the shipments aligning with that, tell us we're well-positioned to not only deliver that fourth quarter, but as we look to our space gains in basics next year, along with the additional innovations that we will introduce more broadly in our Intimates business, we feel really good about where that Innerwear business is going, and it's the consumers sending those signals first through their purchases and the share gains we're seeing.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi, Tiffany. It's Barry, good question. A couple of thoughts to think about there; first of all, in the third quarter, since you referenced it being up 140 basis points, we were very pleased with that and it was very consistent with our expectations, if not even a little bit better.","On organic basis, I'll just tell you. The favorable mix we've been seeing has generated a considerable amount of benefit, $20 million to $25 million in the quarter. And our synergies and cost savings have been generating considerable benefit there as well, probably like $15 million in the quarter, something of that nature. And you know, since you're asking about gross profit, FX was a headwind of some $12 million. That's one that has certainly gotten more negative on us, since the last guidance, and so that would be factored into the fourth quarter.","We mentioned that the sales impact there has moved up appreciably. And in the fourth quarter, I expect FX to be probably $15 million gross profit headwind. And we've taken a conservative view as it relates to synergies and cost savings, although those will continue to contribute in the fourth. And then, inflation has probably been just slightly higher, maybe $5 million higher than we were expecting earlier in the year for the quarter. So, that is the primary items that I would say to think about.","As it relates to mix, it will continue to be, I think, a very nice contributor in the fourth quarter, which speaks to the fact that Champion is growing, our International business is building and we'll have that organic growth we've spoken about. So, we feel very good about it and we are positively inclined to 2019 when we get that pricing benefit to offset that raw material inflation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is now open.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Great. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. I know you mentioned the impressive Champion growth globally. Did you talk about how much it was in the U.S.?","And then, can you just help us walk through just the 30% global constant-currency growth number versus the 7% or the 4% Activewear growth numbers to help us bridge the other components in there? And then, what would you expect Activewear to look like in Q4 based on the expected double-digit growth for Champion? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me start on the first part of that and I'll let Barry do some of the parsing of the pieces. But from the standpoint of global Champion, as we noted, it was up 40% in the quarter, it's actually showing strengthening momentum. The U.S. trend is actually better than that. And so, while we don't parse out the pieces, I could tell you that the U.S. is gaining at a very rapid pace, as well as the world, but it's helping drive that momentum at this point even higher. Barry?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. And then, as it relates to Activewear in the fourth quarter, our guidance at the midpoint would be about 4% organic growth. In the quarter, that's essentially all organic.","In the third quarter, that compares \u2013 it's basically the exact same organic growth rate, but Alternative Apparel goes into organic at that point. So, we feel good about where it is. I'll tell you that from a domestic standpoint on Champion, that was up mid-30s on a year-to-date basis LTM, and we feel good about where it's going. That core Champion business continues to accelerate as well. So, we are feeling very good about our Activewear story.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Barry, a lot of helpful commentary around cash flow for next year. You talked about the earn-out being down, the acquisition charges being down and pricing being up. Just wondering, if there's any plans for stepped-up inventory investment in Champion and Innerwear, given the better trends you're seeing in both those businesses going into the fourth quarter.","And then, Gerald, my follow-up question to you would be, there's a lot of price increases being talked about all throughout retail at this point, particularly could hear a lot more if tariffs start to become a bigger issue. So just wondering, with all the categories that are expected to see price increases, whether it's shirts, shoes, detergent, food, how do you think the consumer in that mass channel is going to respond to, what could be very high price inflation across the entire store at this point? Thank you.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Hi, John, good morning. I would say a couple of thoughts there. As you look at our cash flow guidance that's been updated here, there's really just two things to think about versus our last guidance. One is the after-tax GAAP net income impact of Sears and the more negative FX rate and that's about $20 million.","And then the second thing is, in fact, some incremental inventory to support Champion's growth, and that's roughly $40 million versus our last guide. As we've noted, the Global Champion is growing in excess of 30%. And we're seeing really strong bookings for the first half of 2019. Incidentally, I'd say that we know we've actually lost some sales here in the back half due to limited inventory. So, we are investing in inventory to support that growth.","As it relates to going into next year, if we need incremental inventory into 2019, at this point I would say this amount of inventory is appropriate. Now if we needed incremental inventory next year that would probably be a very good, if you will, \"problem\" because that would imply that it's continuing to accelerate. So, we feel good about where we're positioned the business now at year-end for inventory and on the fuel of Champion's strong positioning.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of price increases, ours are relatively small. They're in the 4% to 5% range, and they're in our Innerwear business. There certainly is right now some heightened chatter about that. We've obviously been discussing this for some period of time. They're really offsetting input costs.","We haven't seen tremendous elasticity in this category, and in fact, when the price increases were much larger back in the days of the cotton bubble, what we saw was that in times of rising prices, consumers tend to move to brands as re-assurance that when they spend their money, they spend it appropriately.","And in our category, we know that price is really a distant fit in the ways that they choose a product and brands and the things that brands deliver are most important. So, I don't think that the pricing will really have an impact on the business.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of David Swartz with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","David Swartz - Morningstar","Yes, thank you. Can you talk about the store openings for Champion and your efforts to increase distribution? And was that the main source of the growth in Champion in the different geographies?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you for the question. Actually, Champion grew globally across all channels. It grew online; it grew across our wholesale customers. And it did grow in our own stores. And we use varying mixes of our own stores depending on the market. International markets are a little less developed in retail, and we tend to have more stores, particularly in the Asian markets where we're now expanding into China as well as we have a strong presence in Japan. And we have a growing presence in Korea. And many of those are Champion-specific stores.","You will see a few showing up in the U.S. market as well. They are certainly selling locations for us, and we open them for profit. But they also then extend the brand. And we open those carefully. We're aware that the U.S. market is heavily stored, but when they're opened in the appropriate markets, they reinforce our brand and become a profitable entity. So fewer stores here and appropriately placed, but all profitable and all doing very well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Noll","Thank you, T.C. In spite of a challenging consumer spending environment, we had another very good quarter, increasing revenue 17%, operating profit 23% and earnings per share 41%. Moreover, this marks the fifth time this year that we are raising our earnings guidance to a range of $5.55 to $5.65 per share. These results are a reflection of one simple fact: our organization is executing very, very well. Our marketing teams are connecting with our consumers, our sales teams are working well with retailers, our supply chain teams continue to increase efficiency, our IT and administrative teams are digitizing processes and our entire organization is effectively integrating acquisitions. This superb execution has led to EPS doubling in just 2 years and it supports our belief that we can continue increasing earnings at double-digit rates for many years to come.","Over the past several years, Innovate-to-Elevate has been an important margin driver. Equally as important has been the performance of our overall supply chain, which, in my opinion, is often overlooked. But it's our vertically integrated company-owned supply chain that is truly the foundation of our business model. It is what enables Innovate-to-Elevate. It enhances margin through ongoing offering efficiencies and it represents the leverage point for creating value with acquisitions. By driving more and more volume through our supply chain with acquisitions, we can generate substantial cost synergies, and therefore, create significant opportunity for margin improvement. We saw this with Gear for Sports and we're seeing it with Maidenform, and we expect to see it with DBA and all of our future acquisitions.","Speaking of acquisitions, let me provide you a brief update. We have just passed the 1-year closing anniversary for Maidenform. In that time, we were able to complete the integration, begin internalizing production, rationalizing our product portfolio and introducing innovations into their design process, a remarkable achievement in only 12 short months. And I think this achievement demonstrates our core competency in acquisition integration. Maidenform is now being run as part of our core business, and going forward, it will be considered as such. Their business continues to perform well this year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver $80 million in operating profit by 2016.","Turning to DBA. We have now owned the company for roughly 2 months. Last month, we hosted 50 of their top executives in Winston-Salem, while earlier this month, Gerald and I spent the week in Europe as the integration teams are diligently working on detailed plans. We are very impressed with the quality of DBA's management team. And the closer we get to their business and their people, the more excited we are that this is a great acquisition for HanesBrands.","So in summary. We have the right set of strategies, we are executing extremely well and this is evident in our results. Looking forward, we believe our ability to leverage the power of our business model by effectively deploying our cash flow positions us for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich. Our business continues to perform extremely well and we're confident this momentum can continue. Our supply chain is delivering strong results as factory efficiencies and ongoing optimization efforts are helping drive margin improvement. Innovate-to-Elevate continues to deliver benefits across the organization, and our acquisitions of Maidenform and DBA are contributing nicely to profits.","Let me start with a brief update on the overall retail environment now that back-to-school is over and we're heading into holiday. As we mentioned in early September, back-to-school at retail got off to a slow start in July, but we saw momentum build in August. The sell-through momentum, particularly within our Innerwear and Basics categories continued through September, helping drive share gains during back-to-school.","Looking to holiday. While we expect the overall consumer environment to remain challenging, we believe we are well positioned as our retail inventories are in line with last year's levels and the sell-through momentum in Basics has continued into early October.","Turning to our segments. Innerwear had another solid quarter. Revenue, excluding Maidenform, was up slightly from last year while operating margins improved 200 basis points, driven predominantly by efficiency gains in our supply chain. Our Basics business had a strong quarter with shipments up mid-single digits, driven by solid POS trends. In our intimates business, we saw positive POS trends in our core bra brands, which were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by innovation. However, shipments in our base intimates business were down from last year, due to tighter inventory management in the mid-tier channel and planned brand consolidations.","Touching briefly on our platform innovations. ComfortBlend and X-TEMP now represent nearly 13% of our Basics revenue as these platforms continue to expand their space. X-TEMP, in particular, is seeing solid gains as we expand the platform into new products and channels of distribution, while driving strong productivity results for our retail partners. In our bra business, our ComfortFlex Fit platform continues to perform well. It represents over 20% of our bra business and is seeing sell-through increase 14% year-to-date.","Switching to Activewear. Sales in the quarter increased 5% over last year driven by strong double-digit growth in our Gear for Sports business. Revenue in our Champion business is up 5% year-to-date with strong results in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels being somewhat offset by mass. For the full year, we now expect Champion revenue to increase high single digits with continued opportunities for expansion at sporting goods, mid-tier and department stores going into 2015.","Activewear delivered an operating margin of 16.1% for the quarter, up from 14.4% last quarter and 10.9% in the first quarter as the benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate continue to drive margin improvement.","Turning to international. Sales, excluding DBA, were up 1% over last year and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Excluding DBA, operating profit increased 23%, while our operating margin improved 270 basis points to 15.3% due to contributions from Maidenform as well as continued benefits from our regionalization strategy.","So to sum up. Our business continues to perform extremely well. The combination of our company-owned supply chain, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and the effective deployment of our cash flow are driving strong returns for shareholders, and we're confident this momentum can continue.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss","Thanks, Gerald. We had another quarter of strong results. Contributions from acquisitions, efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate combined to deliver earnings per share growth of 41% for the quarter and 44% year-to-date, providing further evidence of the power of our business model.","For the quarter, revenue increased 17% over last year to $1.4 billion as our core business contributed 1 percentage point to our growth rate, while Maidenform contributed roughly 9 points and DBA added approximately 7 points. Our gross profit margin increased 190 basis points from last year to 37.1% with DBA accounting for approximately 60 basis points of the increase. Despite only owning the business for 1 month in the quarter, DBA had an outsized impact on our margin due to the fact that European companies typically carry higher gross margin rates and higher SG&A rates.","For the quarter, SG&A costs increased 120 basis points to 21.6% of sales with 90 basis points attributed to DBA.","Our operating profit increased 23% or $40 million from last year with the growth roughly split between contributions from our acquisitions and improved margins in our core business. For the quarter, our operating margins increased 70 basis points to 15.5% as the 30 basis point headwind from DBA was more than offset by 100 basis point increase in the remainder of our business.","Interest and other expense as well as our tax expense were in line with our previously stated guidance, resulting in EPS for the quarter of $1.73, which was slightly ahead of our plan.","Turning to full year guidance. We continue to expect full year revenue to be between $5,350,000,000 and $5,375,000,000, which includes approximately $500 million from Maidenform and $275 million to $300 million from DBA. We've increased our operating profit guidance $15 million to a range of $750 million to $770 million. The midpoint implies an operating profit margin of 14.2% or 130 basis points above last year, a great achievement that more than overcomes the dilution from Maidenform, and now, DBA. Inherent in our full year operating profit guidance is approximately $45 million from Maidenform and approximately EUR 20 million from DBA or about $25 million.","We expect roughly $93 million in interest and other expense and a full year tax rate of approximately 13% to 14%.","Given our performance year-to-date, we've raised our EPS guidance to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. The midpoint represents an EPS increase of roughly 43%, which would come on top of last year's 49% increase.","We've also increased the low end of our cash flow from operations guidance, bringing our new range to $550 million to $600 million.","For the fourth quarter, our guidance implies a sales range of $1,550,000,000 to $1,570,000,000, an operating profit range of $187 million to $207 million and an EPS range of $1.35 to $1.45. Note that the quarter includes a 53rd week, which should result in a $25 million to $30 million increase in sales and an approximately $3 million increase in operating profit.","As suggested earlier, DBA should have a positive effect on our gross margin and a negative effect on our SG&A rate. Inherent in our guidance, on a year-over-year basis, is the assumption that a full quarter impact of DBA could add roughly 170 basis points to our fourth quarter gross profit margin and add roughly 270 basis points to our SG&A rate.","So in closing. We had another strong quarter despite the challenging consumer environment. Margins continue to expand in our core business, and our acquisitions have become meaningful contributors to our growth rates. Going forward, our ability to effectively deploy our cash flow in ways that will best leverage our business model positions us for continued double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the third quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, Rich or even Gerald, for you, a follow-up just in terms of what you guys are seeing as we enter into holiday within the mass channel and innerwear, specifically. Looks like sequentially, picking up a bit, but maybe just a little bit more color on the environment. And then within that, sort of this deflationary aspect going on, be it cotton or oil, the puts and takes in how you think that impacts the business.","Richard A. Noll","Yes, so Eric, let me go and talk about the macro environment and I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk a little bit more explicitly about holiday as well as sort of into '15 in terms of pricing and things like that. So the macro environment, from a consumer perspective, has been the same for, actually, at least the last 2 years where we're seeing consumers come out at certain times and spend and then it seems like they go back and they hunker down. So it's sort of up and down, marginally positive. And fortunately, coming into the year, we've made the assumption that, that was going to continue and it was going to be a relatively choppy muted environment, and unfortunately, it turned out to be the case. The great thing is our business model was fine-tuned to operate really well in a low-growth environment and you're seeing it in our earnings results this year. And our expectation is that kind of environment's going to continue, but we feel really good about being able to navigate it. Gerald, do you want to talk more specifically about holiday?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, Eric, as we look toward holiday, I think Rich is spot on. We anticipate it'll be somewhat the same kind of environment, up and down, choppy with a modest sort of upward trend. As we entered October, we saw the first week of POS, for example, down, followed by an up week and then a flat week, which sort of reaffirms that sort of choppiness in the environment. Coming out of back-to-school, we think we came out certainly clean on inventory. And along with the offerings we have in the market, we think we're positioned well to benefit even in a choppy market, and so we feel good about where we sit and certainly have built that in our guidance as we look forward. As we look to 2015, yes, pricing is pretty settled in the market right now. I think the one thing that our retail partners have learned over time is it's really value creation through innovation and things that drive growth over time, not discounting, and we think that the retailers are positioned well to continue that into the New Year and have benefited from it through the back-to-school period.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. And let me just actually talk a little bit about inflation expectations. I think that I'd like to remind everybody that -- Rick, don't we have about 15% of our cost of goods is labor and...","Richard D. Moss","That's right. And cotton's less than 10%.","Richard A. Noll","Less than 10%. So -- and I do think that everybody, especially all the retailers, understand that wages in the developing world are going up at high single digits to double-digit levels. And that while cotton may be a little bit of a tailwind, they do recognize that there's other inflationary pressures. And we're going to be in a moderate cost-push inflation environment over time, and that's where brands thrive and that's, I think, another advantage that we're going to have over the next couple of years.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And then if I could just follow up. In terms of the acquisition pipeline out there, Rich, I mean, obviously you've got to digest DBA a bit here, but as you look forward, maybe just speak to the landscape. I know you're not going to get specific on particular assets. But just again, how you kind of continue to refresh, use the free cash to go out and find accretive acquisitions that you can leverage the supply chain and scale of a business?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, you're absolutely right. We've owned DBA for 2 months. We need to focus on developing our integration plans. But that said, we have very strict criteria that guide our acquisition thinking, one being in our core categories and the second one is being able to leverage that global supply chain where we can create a lot of value for our shareholders. And when you think about the types of companies, domestically and globally, that are in our core categories, that actually, over the last decade or so, got out of their supply chains, we believe we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to create value through acquisitions for many years. And it's why it's become one of, not the only, but just one of our strategic initiatives to create value and we think we're doing it well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Europe and DBA, can you -- I know you haven't owned the asset that long, but can you talk about what you're learning about the market. You look at your business in the U.S. and you look at the European economy, it's roughly the same size as North America, give or take. But you look at this huge business and platform you've built in the U.S. across the different brands and categories and channels that you operate in, can you talk about what you're learning about the European market? Is there an opportunity to scale it up there? Or is it fundamentally different in terms of more fragmented across different countries and different retailers and channels and different regions? Is that an inhibiting factor? Do you think this platform could be a much bigger platform, longer term, in Europe?","Richard A. Noll","So I want to -- we're learning -- as you said, we're learning a lot about the market and I think we're going to find that there's sort of 2 ends to that question that you're actually asking and -- but at the end of the day, it'll ultimately play to our strength. So when you look at Europe, in the innerwear market, there is no Europe. There are countries. And each country has its own set of brands that a lot of which have been around for 60 to 100 years, they're strong in their categories, but they tend to be subscale. And I think DIM's a great example, the largest brand in the DBA portfolio. Strong #1 and #2 positions in France, but it really doesn't play in Germany or in Italy, to speak of. There's other brands that we have in those markets. So when you look at Europe in innerwear, it's really you've got to look at it country-by-country to understand the brand position. Now on the flip side, what we do believe can work and work extremely well to allow us to use our scale advantages are 2 things: One, platform innovation can work across countries, it can work across brands and it's a great way. We find that consumers are looking for the same types of things in innerwear products in a lot of those countries as they are in United States, Mexico, Canada or Brazil. So we'll be able to drive our platform innovations across countries and across brands. And then the second thing is, obviously, the global supply chain. So you're going to see it's going to be a bit of a hybrid model in Europe where there's going to be country-specific brands and commercial organizations that are focused against that local trade and the local consumers, but we're going to be able to get scale advantages by driving Innovate-to-Elevate platform innovation across as well as leveraging our global supply chain. So I think from our perspective, acquisitions work extremely well in this. You can buy strong #1 or #2 positions, plug them into your global platforms and supply chain and really create a lot of shareholder value.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And that's kind of my follow-up. In Europe, you obviously got a -- now you have a pretty decent size presence across a lot of these countries. Is there -- is organic growth the way to attack newer markets or newer segments of the market in Europe across the various countries? Or is it possible that there could be future acquisitions to layer on to your new European platform?","Richard A. Noll","So again, the answer is yes to both. You're going to find in some of those more developed markets, there's strong branded positions, for example, in Germany. While we have a strong -- with the DBA acquisition, we have a strong position in hosiery, we don\u2019t necessarily have a strong position in men's underwear or even women's intimate apparel. We've got efforts to drive organic growth there. But an acquisition in that market might not be out of the question from a long-term prospect. I'm not saying that we're focused on any target there today. In other markets such as Eastern Europe and some of the other countries where there's a lot more fragmentation and you don't see those kind of strong brands, I think continued organic growth with some of the European brands could also make sense. So we're going to have to look at that country-by-country, category-by-category, but we've got a lot of opportunity once we fully integrate DBA to the degree that we need to drive the results with that business that we can use that as a platform for continued growth in Europe for a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was wondering if you could maybe touch on maybe more broadly just where you see the drivers of double-digit earnings growth going over the next 2 to 3 years given, in the U.S. market, your top line is probably like low single to mid-single digits. So I guess if you could maybe rank getting to that double-digit, from acquisitions, I2E, share repurchases, international, et cetera?","Richard A. Noll","So I think I'll break that into a couple of components because I firmly believe we've got that opportunity to continue double digits for many, many years. And, obviously, we want to drive -- continue to drive I2E in our core businesses. But also remember, those core businesses generate a tremendous amount of cash, and so that cash flow gives you the ability to deploy that to also drive earnings growth at a faster rate than sales or even operating profit growth. And we can deploy that cash, either returning it to shareholders through dividends or making smart acquisitions. So acquisitions is obviously going to be a piece of that, but let's not ignore the fact that we've got that cash flow coming from those core businesses, which also put sort of a strong base from which we continue to drive earnings over time. I think we've got still a lot of categories that can benefit from Innovate-to-Elevate. It's further along in some areas than others, but you're just seeing the beginnings of that show up in the Activewear segment where, for the first time, we hit double-digit operating margins just last year. That's improving so far again this year, but we're not done there. So we've got a lot of opportunity to drive margin expansion in core business, use that cash flow, use acquisitions as a part of our strategy to continue driving double-digit EPS for many, many years.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the Activewear. So it looks like Gear For Sports really kind of drove everything with double-digit growth. Is this a new base that we should expect? And then, I guess, on everything else excluding that, it looks like it was a little bit on the lighter side, if you can maybe add a little bit more color on that?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, I'll talk a little bit about Gear. I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk about Activewear and probably Champion, more specifically, in Activewear. So Gear for Sports was our first acquisition. We closed it at the end of 2010. It's doing extremely well. It's got a lot of strong, solid top line growth this year. But most importantly, their operating profit growth has been at an even faster rate. We've hit all of the synergies that we were looking for over time. We feel really good about the momentum of that business and believe that it could be a platform for further growth within the Activewear segment, again, for a number of years. So it was a great acquisition and you're really seeing it start to shine through, especially in this last quarter of this year. Gerald, do you want to talk about rest of Activewear, including Champion?","Gerald W. Evans","Sure. Really, when you look at the rest of Activewear, the heart of that is the retail Activewear business and that's the Champion business. And if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, Champion sales have increased 5% over the prior year. And on a full year basis, we're still expecting Champion sales to grow in the high single digits, down slightly from the 10% rate we talked about earlier, but still a very solid high single-digit rate. The Champion brand, itself, continues to resonate very well with consumers. It's performing very well in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels. Its success is being diluted somewhat in the short term by some challenges in the mass channel. We'll overlap these challenges in the mass channel in the fourth quarter, and we're also implementing a number of actions to accelerate mass growth going forward. So as we look to the fourth quarter, we have real good visibility now to our order bank and we feel good about returning a very solid growth across the sporting goods, the department store and mass channels in the fourth quarter. And we also continue to see gains in distribution coming in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels end of '15. So we feel good about where the Activewear business is going.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Rich, I know you probably can't talk too much on this. But in your prepared remarks, you talked about the cross-company integration planning for DBA. I know it's only been 2 months, but can you just share any maybe early results or lessons learned or anything in more detail in terms of how you're thinking more about that integration?","Richard A. Noll","Well, I can't give you any more detail on the integration plan because we literally are right in the midst of it now, so it would be premature to try and talk about it before we actually formulate those plans. I think we will have a lot more to say about it in our fourth quarter call in late January. But what we have learned over the last couple of months is that they've got a really, really strong management team. Their brand positions in their respective markets are really, really good. We do think we've got a lot of opportunity to drive some of those platform innovation across in some of the selected markets, especially where we don't have strong share positions. I think I referred to somewhere like Germany before. German, the market, there's a lot of aspects of the basics market there that look a lot like the U.S. and we think some of those products may be applicable to go in and rifle shot and go after some organic growth, leveraging our global supply chain. So we feel really good about what's there. With the -- about the only negative that sort of emerged is it looks like the macro headwinds in Europe are a little bit softening in some of the key geographies. Southern Europe seems to have stabilized and that hasn't changed, but I think you hear in the media a little bit about slowdown in France and\/or Germany, so we'll be mindful of that. But we didn't buy this business for the short term. We bought this business for the long term, and we feel really good about our ability to get all the leverage and synergies that we talked about. But it's too early to really hit on any specifics yet.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's completely fair. But as a follow-up question, just the acquisition of DBA does somewhat change your geographic mix. And with exchange rates fluctuating as much as they do, I mean, how should we think about FX pressures going forward on the various levels and your ability to manage through them?","Richard A. Noll","First, let me talk about how FX might have impacted the DBA acquisition and then I'll turn it over to Rick to talk more specifically about how exchange rates impact our near-term and going-forward P&L. So when you look at the DBA acquisition, we bought the company in euros, Rick actually financed the debt in euros and we intend to use their cash flow in euros to pay off that debt over time. So when you look at the after-tax internal rate of returns, it's not really impacted virtually at all by the difference in exchange rate from when we announced the acquisition to when we completed it. We still also feel very good about leveraging our size and scale in getting all those synergies, more than doubling their operating profit over 3 to 4 years and ultimately having it contribute $1 of earnings per share. So no real impact there. In terms of the P&L in the near term and go forward, Rick?","Richard D. Moss","We've seen a moderation of the impact of FX rates on the business as the year's gone by -- as this year has gone by. We were about -- it was about $5 million of FX impact on the top line in the third quarter. In terms of going forward, keep in mind that DBA will be incremental to us for a full year, therefore, constant currency comparisons really won't be impacted by the DBA acquisition until, really, until the fourth quarter of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on how you're thinking about retailer inventory management as we head into the fourth quarter? And what your expectations are for that European business as well from an inventory standpoint?","Richard A. Noll","So our expectations on retail inventories going into holiday and our expectations on how they're managing it, Gerald?","Gerald W. Evans","Going into holiday, we feel like that we're well positioned from a retail inventory standpoint. We had a good sell-through coming out of back-to-school, entered in a solid position and we think we're well positioned for how the sell-through will go in that period of time. So from the standpoint of where we're positioned going in, it looks good and don't really have any overhang from inventory at this point in time.","Richard A. Noll","And in terms of coming out -- the expectation what might be coming out, generally when inventories do get pulled down towards the retailers' year-ends, generally that happens in January. We have seen 2 times in December of '08 and December of '11 where retailers pulled their inventories down a little bit earlier in December. That tends to be more unusual. Our planning assumption now is that the inventories will probably be reduced in January. But Rick, correct me if I'm wrong, but even if they do pull it up, it's not a huge impact on our overall business, wouldn't you say?","Richard D. Moss","Right. It might push us a little bit more towards the lower end of the range on sales and profit, but that's all. About all it would do.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions. First, in terms of the -- it sounds like inventories are well under control at retail. And I'm just wondering if retailers are continuing to see inflation as their friend and whether there's any changes in terms of whether some of maybe your weaker competitors are getting more aggressive from a promotional standpoint? Or you've seen the continuation of what you're seeing over the last year or so? And then secondly, you clearly have an opportunity to build scale in your European business, wonder how you think about the Asian market from an M&A standpoint?","Gerald W. Evans","Let me take the first part of the question first, David, from the standpoint of promotion and volatility in the business right now. We're seeing actually that pricing has been very stable. The retailers actually generally performed and priced through the back-to-school period as we expected. The retailers that won generally had a little improvement in their average selling price, and certainly, our innovations helped drive that in many of our core categories and it was for that reason that we certainly feel we gained share as well. So we're seeing stability right now in the market from that standpoint.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of Asia as a potential for M&A. David, I know you know our acquisition criteria very well, but I'll just recap it for some others. In our core categories, high-probability cost synergies with supply chain or SG&A leverage, complementary revenue growth opportunities by geography or segments or channel and quickly accretive. And so we don't necessarily have anything that prioritizes one acquisition over another after that. So we don't -- we're not prioritizing Europe over Asia or domestic or Innerwear over Activewear. Once things get -- through that screen, we look at all of the opportunities we'd have. And when a deal looks right for us and for the other side and we can make a deal that's going to be in interest of our shareholders, we'll go ahead and do so. So there's no real sub-prioritization. So Asia, we've done some acquisitions there, some small acquisitions over time. It's either not off of our radar screen nor is it the next highest priority either. It's just in the mix.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the decline in the Activewear margin, what were the drivers behind it. And then secondly, it sounds like you're assuming an acceleration in the Activewear business. I think you said you expect to overcome some of the challenges you've seen in the mass market. Can you talk a little bit about -- more about why that assumption?","Richard A. Noll","Go ahead, Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Let me take the first part of your question. First, from the standpoint of Activewear profitability, it's improved nicely over the year. It's up 15% year-to-date, up 90 points from an operating margin standpoint. Over the last 2 years, we put down sort of a gauntlet that we'd take the business from a single digit kind of operating margin into the double digits. We achieved double digits last year and we pushed it even higher this year. So we think profitability is actually performing quite well and we're quite proud of where that business is going, and it's a real example of what Innovate-to-Elevate brings to a business as we see it. From the standpoint of where we sit now and where we view the fourth quarter on the Activewear side, our order book does look strong for the fourth quarter and we do expect that our trends will improve in the Champion business, in particular, in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Unknown Analyst","My question's [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from CL King & Associates.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","What was the year-over-year inventory growth excluding acquisitions?","Richard D. Moss","Steve, it was about $16 million.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Rich, you touched on it earlier regarding the European market, maybe you can go into a little more detail. Does it track the domestic market at all from a traffic standpoint? When things are choppy here, things are choppy there; things are down here, things are down there; up here, up there? Can you talk is there any correlation whatsoever? And if not, what's happening there right now from a traffic standpoint in general?","Richard A. Noll","So it doesn't track that closely and I think for a couple of reasons. One is the mix of business there is a little different than what we have in the U.S. That business is all Innerwear and is more heavily weighted towards hosiery. And so the cadence, the seasonality of it is very different. If you remember, we've said when we gave the initial guidance for DBA this year, we said over half of their profitability is delivered in the 4 months of September through December, which is different than the rest of our business, and it's mainly due to hosiery. So that traffic pattern's a little different. The other thing is some of those business -- I don\u2019t like to use the weather word because, to me, weather can impact the business in a very short term, but it doesn't impact it over the medium to long term. But clearly, the weather is going to impact hosiery sales just like it would impact fleece sales in the short term. And the weather in Europe, obviously, is independent of what's going on here. So you don't see the same correlation. And the other thing is, I think, we're seeing a little bit of a divergence of the macro economy. Now I'm going out on a limb here because I'm not that experienced with the European market nor do we have economists that are telling us. But it sounds like what you read in the papers, the European market is slowing down a little bit yet the United States isn't yet. So there's a little bit of a disconnect. But at the end of the day, we're still in the innerwear category. And one thing I know is you've got weekly or monthly or even quarterly volatility, but there, like here, the pairs -- purchase per person per year, all of my Ps, tends to be very stable and even out over time and be pretty consistent year in and year out.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Raising the guidance 5 times in 1 year, not too bad. Congratulations on the success. I'm hoping -- a couple of questions. First, can you share some perspective on your sight lines to shelf space for some of your key product categories into spring '15?","Gerald W. Evans","Well, I think that as we look towards '15, we are beginning to see the gains early, so we feel like there will be gains across a number of our businesses, certainly our innovations and our Basics continue to resonate well, and I think by virtue of our share gains, you get a sense of the power of what we're doing and that we're driving share gains with that as well as we can also see them now in the Activewear business coming as well, as I referenced in my comments, going into the start of next year. So good solid gains across-the-board.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then supply chain efficiencies continue to come through nicely, again really strong gross margins with the focus on the legacy business. Looking forward, can you maybe highlight some of the larger opportunities for ongoing supply chain efficiencies?","Gerald W. Evans","It's -- we couldn't be prouder of our supply chain. We look at what's it doing, we've gone from building it to just running it and optimizing it and it's just running beautifully. And so we're seeing performance really across-the-board from the standpoint of the efficiency improvements, through better utilization of our factories and equipment, to improved quality standards, to service improvements. So everywhere we're touching, we're driving cost improvements. And I think that it really speaks well to our ability to continue to drive, not only efficiencies in what we're doing with our current business, but as we incorporate our acquisitions in there to even drive those further improvement in costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle McCoy from Wunderlich.","Danielle McCoy - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to touch base on Maidenform and switch gears a little bit. In our channel checks, we've really been seeing a lot of better placement and elevated images really across-the-board. So I was wondering if you could just talk and give us a little bit more color on some of the work that you've done there? Any -- the products, SKU rationalization, space gains and pricing adjustments.","Gerald W. Evans","Maidenform, for us, is playing out exactly as we planned. We certainly have gone in where we knew there were some SKUs and so forth that needed to be out of there and we rationalized it down. We're well on course to hit the sales objective we put in place. And the exciting part is now we're beginning to apply our own Innovate-to-Elevate concepts to the line, and that literally next week at market, we begin to show the first of our products for fall '15, which were designed by our new design group and apply our Innovate-to-Elevate approach to those products. So we think we're making great progress. We're beginning to see performance improvement in many areas of the business.","Richard A. Noll","Yes, and I'll also add that you'll also begin to see at retail, if you do a lot of channel checks, probably early next year where we're taking some of the smaller brands and transitioning them into the larger brands because we're going after fewer, bigger, not only just with some of the Maidenform brands, such as Lilyette, but also some of our -- what was in the HanesBrands portfolio, some of the smaller brands, because what we're trying to do is we've got very different, distinct positioning for our 4 big brands and we intend to drive those and subsume the smaller brands into that larger positioning. So you'll see more to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just quickly revisit product costs, cotton, et cetera. I know that it sounds labor is a bigger component, but like-for-like, are product costs expected to be down for you next year? Part 2 of that question, can you just remind us what the lag looks like between buying cotton or spot cotton and how that impacts your P&L? And finally, if you can just give us some context as to what kind of wage inflation you're seeing?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. I'm sure between Gerald and myself, we can figure this out. Cotton continues to be a lower and lower percentage of our cost of sales as we have done the Maidenform and the DBA acquisition -- DBApparel acquisition. And so, it will be below 10% next year. That's been falling in recent years. So yes, we will see lower cotton costs in the second half of next year. That's about how long it'll take for what you're seeing on the December contract today to actually be harvested and then sold, put into production. So it'll be the second half of next year before you see that. But keep in mind that, as I said earlier, about 15% of our cost base is in labor and we're seeing double-digit wage increases in developing markets. And again, against a low base, but still that's having an upward pressure on costs. And just in general, we're seeing a return to a modest inflationary environment. So as Rich said, that's great for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Burns from D.A. Davidson.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","It's amazing that the Maidenform, from a supply chain perspective, was integrated in under a year, a phenomenal time line there. Is that something that can be replicated on most acquisitions? Or was it particularly unique in terms of the product that enabled that compressed time line?","Richard A. Noll","So as I said, I believe that we are developing, if we don't already have, a distinct competence in acquisition integration. And we're basically leveraging the skills that we developed in transforming our own organization when we spun off 8 years ago where we had to actually take 8 independent divisions, integrate them into one operating company and we've picked up our supply chain and moved a lot of it around the world. We kept those same types of very detailed, disciplined action planning processes where we come together as an organization and make sure everybody's doing their part on time and we're now applying that to external acquisitions. And I think with the Maidenform, you can see, I think, it worked well. Now not every acquisition's going to work at exactly the same speed. We've already talked about the difference between Maidenform, which was a U.S. acquisition, and DBApparel, which is a European acquisition, where with Maidenform, we expect the full synergies within 3 years, but with DBApparel, because in Europe it takes -- things just take a little bit longer, we've said 3 to 4. So we've got to adjust the time line depending upon the product category, the geography and a number of other things. But clearly, I do think and we intend to continue to improve our ability to integrate acquisitions and create shareholder value.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And in the prepared remarks, you talked about ComfortBlend and X-TEMP reaching 13% sales and still growing. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on sort of the new products and channels of distribution you were referring to in growing that product? And have you seen any pushback in terms of pricing for any of those innovations, given the premium versus the basic product?","Gerald W. Evans","Sure, let me take that question and I'll answer the last part of it first. We haven't seen pushback on pricing and I think because we've carefully researched these products and the consumer clearly sees the value in the innovation that they're purchasing. From the standpoint of where we're gaining space, we're gaining space in multiple ways. We're gaining space across channels, but also within the accounts because, remember, we're treating these as platforms. So as we drive them out, we're driving them across underwear and socks, and in the case of X-TEMP, it's now crossed into panties and to women's socks as well. So we've seen expansion both within our channels and across new channels and now we're beginning to do the next extension of some of these innovations in channels as well. So mass channel, mid-tier channel, across-the-board we're seeing expansion.","Richard A. Noll","And let me also reiterate, a lot of times I get asked if this trade-up is creating a price umbrella where other competitors can come in and undercut you and not with the strategy that we're doing because our core products are still out there and we maintain and we monitor those price gaps like we always have. And these trade-up products are over and above that core pricing, so it doesn't create a pricing umbrella. What it does is it segments consumers into those that are a little bit more price sensitive and aren't willing to pay for those extra features and benefits. The core product is still there and it sells very well and we make great money off of those products. And those that want those extra features and benefits like ComfortBlend are willing to pay 30% to 40% more or X-TEMP willing to pay even more than that, and that's how we go about this trade-up strategy.","Operator","Our final question for today comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one question related to capital structure and your comfort level with leverage. How long do you think it'll take to get back down to your leverage in the 2s?","Richard D. Moss","Well, Carla, we've said of late is that the great thing about our capital structure is that -- and the cash flow that we have is it gives us a lot of opportunities. We don't have to focus on a leverage ratio range per se. We love being at our BB+, BB rating. We feel very comfortable with that. We think that gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to drive our strategy with respect to how we deploy our cash flow. So really not thinking of it quite in those terms, but we'll -- going to continue to generate a lot of cash and deploy it in similar ways that we've been doing it.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to T.C. Robillard for closing comments.","T.C.

For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Gerald will provide an update on the Maidenform integration and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll","Thank you, T.C. The first quarter was another great quarter for HanesBrands. Our business continues to do extremely well, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is driving higher levels of profitability and we're beginning to see the benefits from bolt-on acquisitions.","For the quarter, we grew revenue 12%, operating profit 34% and EPS 49%, once again demonstrating our ability to magnify our sales growth into faster operating profit growth and even faster earnings per share growth. The fact that we're delivering strong results in a challenging consumer environment is a testament to our strong consumer franchise, the success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and our ability to effectively deploy our cash flow.","And we're not done. You've heard me say this before but it's worth highlighting again. With the strength of our cash flow and the ability to cascade Innovate-to-Elevate throughout our entire organization, we believe you're only beginning to see the earnings potential of our business.","As we look to the remainder of 2014, we're confident the momentum in Innovate-to-Elevate can continue and the profit contribution from Maidenform will continue to grow. We are reflecting this confidence by raising our full year EPS guidance $0.20 to a range of $4.80 to $5 per share.","The integration of Maidenform is going extremely well, and I couldn't be happier with our progress. Gerald will focus his entire remarks on the integration. But before he does, let me take a minute to update you on the trends within our core business.","For the quarter, revenue, excluding Maidenform, was roughly flat on a constant currency basis, a very solid achievement given the current consumer environment. Innovate-to-Elevate continued to drive our Activewear business, where sales were up 10% over last year driven by our Champion brand, and operating profit was up 50%.","Within Innerwear, the significant weather in the quarter, along with the Easter shift, clearly impacted results. Excluding Maidenform, retail sell-through declined approximately 2% for the quarter. As retailers adjusted their inventories, our shipments declined 6%. However, given the replenishment nature of the Innerwear business, we expect much of this decline to reverse over the year. In fact, April's point-of-sale trends have already rebounded, running at mid-single-digit increases.","Turning to international, we had a very solid quarter. On a constant currency basis and excluding Maidenform, sales increased approximately 8%. We continue to make good progress with our regionalization strategy, where we are leveraging the tremendous scale and capabilities of our domestic business.","Lastly, our profit margins are at record first quarter levels and are exceeding our expectations due to the great success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy in Champion, superb performance from our supply chain and a slight beat [ph] in Maidenform.","So in closing, our business is doing extremely well, and we're confident this momentum can continue. We believe the combination of our strong consumer franchise, our margin enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and the potential leverage from additional bolt-on acquisitions position us to deliver solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich. I'll devote my comments today to the Maidenform integration, where we are on track and we have reached several key milestones. I'm pleased to announce that as of March 2, all of Maidenform's domestic business is being run by our people on our systems using our processes. And with the exception of closing their distribution center, we expect the integration to be complete by the end of the second quarter.","While we hit a few bumps along the way, which is to be expected, the process has gone extremely well. To have effectively completed an integration of this magnitude in only 9 months is a remarkable achievement, and one that emphasizes our core competency in executing large, complex integration projects. We now have a proven repeatable process of project integration. We have honed this process over the years through our experiences, including our spinoff, the relocation of our global supply chain and the acquisitions of Gear For Sports and now Maidenform.","While an integration project is very complex, our overall process is rather straightforward: detailed preparation paired with consistent execution. We start with an organizational road map. We pull together our experienced project management team. And from there, we create a sophisticated project plan.","In the case of Maidenform, our integration plan had over 4,700 individual project tasks and over 650 project milestones, while our integration team involved roughly 300 people, with 10 of them dedicated solely to managing the integration.","Looking at the Maidenform integration, the design, merchandising and sales functions were integrated within weeks of the closing, while the supply chain, HR and legal functions were absorbed by the end of December. And by March, the domestic Maidenform business was fully operational on our IT system. All of their financial reporting, forecasting, ordering and purchasing as well as their retail operations are now being done on our system.","And all personnel decisions have been communicated. Of the total headcount reductions, 60% should be completed by the end of June, with the majority done by the end of this month. The balance of the reductions, primarily from the closing of the Fayetteville distribution center, should be completed in the fourth quarter. With the big hurdles now behind us, we expect the P&L benefits to flow through as we previously communicated, with SG&A beginning this year. As we internalize manufacturing, you should see those benefits in 2015 and 2016.","We are now turning our attention to cascading Innovate-to-Elevate throughout Maidenform. Our marketing team is focused on enhancing the Maidenform brand position to maximize its complementary nature with our strong portfolio of intimate apparel brands. In addition, we are beginning to apply our platform innovations to bring meaningful innovation to the Maidenform product line. And of course, we are rapidly internalizing Maidenform production into our global supply chain to reduce costs and leverage scale.","But what exactly does this mean to the investment community? Well, it means 3 things. First, the integration risk is substantially behind us. Second, we are developing a distinct competency in acquisition integration. And third, over the course of the year, the integration constraint to doing another transaction should be meaningfully reduced.","So to wrap up, I am very pleased with the accomplishments of the entire team on executing this very complex integration, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we bring our full suite of intimates offerings to our customers.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss","Thanks, Gerald. We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Our operating profit grew 34%, driven by 3 factors. The first is that Innovate-to-Elevate continued to drive increased profitability in our core businesses, particularly within our Activewear segment. The second was better-than-expected supply chain efficiencies and SG&A leverage, and finally, the addition of Maidenform.","As a result of this strong performance, we're confident that the momentum in our business can continue, and we've reflected that confidence by increasing our full year guidance for operating profit, EPS and cash flow from operations.","For the quarter, revenue grew 12% to approximately $1.1 billion, driven by the addition of $125 million in sales from Maidenform. The remainder of our business was roughly flat on a constant currency basis, a solid result given the weather-challenged quarter and the continued uneven consumer spending environment.","Let me take a moment to touch on the performance of some of our businesses for the quarter. As a result of adding new distribution in mid-tier and shelf space gains within our existing accounts, our Champion business delivered high-teens revenue growth, one of the key drivers of the performance of our Activewear segment.","Turning to Innerwear. Maidenform drove growth in the segment for the quarter. Excluding Maidenform, our Basics business was flat, while our intimates business was down from last year. Currency was once again a headwind in the quarter, representing a drag of roughly $11 million or 100 basis points of growth on total company sales. Gross profit margin was 35.1%, up 50 basis points over last year as the benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate in our core business overcame the dilutive effect of generally lower Maidenform margins.","SG&A spending increased $15 million over last year due to the addition of Maidenform and $2 million of incremental media spend. Excluding these 2 items, SG&A in dollar terms would have experienced a mid-single-digit decline from last year.","Operating profit of $114 million was up 34% from last year, while our operating margin increased 180 basis points to 10.8%, a record for the first quarter. Interest and other expense, as well as our tax expense, were in line with our previously stated guidance, resulting in EPS for the quarter of $0.76, a 49% increase over last year.","Now turning to our guidance. We continue to expect full year sales to be slightly less than $5.1 billion, with approximately $500 million coming from Maidenform. We've increased our operating profit guidance to $665 million to $685 million, which includes approximately $30 million from Maidenform. This compares to our prior range of $640 million to $660 million, with $25 million from Maidenform. Inherent in this guidance is an expectation of roughly $85 million in interest and other expense and a full year tax rate in the low teens.","Given the strong profitability in the first quarter and our confidence that the momentum in our business can continue through the year, we've raised our EPS range $0.20 to $4.80 to $5 per share. The midpoint represents an increase of 25%, on top of last year's 49% increase. We've also increased our cash flow from operations guidance by $25 million to a range of $475 million to $575 million.","So in closing, we had another strong quarter despite the challenging consumer environment. Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continues to deliver strong results, with a margin expansion across the organization particularly within our Activewear segment, and Maidenform's profitability is coming in slightly ahead of expectations. All of this gives us confidence to raise our full year operating profit and EPS guidance. And as we continue to execute on the things we can control and effectively deploy our cash flow, we believe we are very well positioned to deliver solid double-digit EPS growth for the next several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the first quarter. We will now begin taking your questions, and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question, Rich, in the press release, you talk about branded printwear, and I was just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the things that you're doing in that specific market. When we talk about Innovate-to-Elevate, what type of -- is there a specific strategy to branded printwear that we should think about that you can do with that specific market? And what are some of the opportunities there? Maybe you -- just some elaboration there.","Richard A. Noll","Sure. I think it was about 2 years ago where we said, \"Look, we need to look at our entire portfolio and exit private label or very commodity-like pieces of business,\" and the major piece of business that we had was in that branded printwear area, both in Europe as well as United States. We exited that piece of that business in Europe, and we actually retrenched in the United States. But we did maintain about $150 million, maybe $165 million worth of business there that is in fact branded. Consumers buy it because they want the brands, or actually, the screen printers buy it either because consumers have requested it or the wholesaler or the screen printer wants to make sure that they've got great quality product to provide to their end user. And so we see products such as Champion, we see some of the Hanes products, TAGLESS, for example, which do very well in those markets and are a little bit less price-sensitive. So we've maintained that business. We feel pretty good about it. It's actually doing -- I think it's actually exceeding our expectations both a little bit last year as well as this year. And it's just a testament to if you focus on brands and drive great product with innovation, it works in a lot of different marketplaces. That said, the Innovate-to-Elevate is working extremely well at retail, and that's what's really driving our results.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I may ask one follow-up for Rick. There's been a lot of discussion about the successful track record of integrating acquisitions, et cetera, on the call today. I was just wondering, as we look forward, could you remind us about the capital structure, your thoughts on that in terms of ability to take on leverage, et cetera, where were you -- where your updated thoughts are on that?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. Well, as you know, we have a solid BB credit rating, which gives us tremendous flexibility in terms of being able to execute against our business plan, including the -- any potential acquisition that would meet our criteria that Rich has talked about in the past. So we're very confident on that front.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So Rich, maybe we can talk about kind of the trend going on in the core business. Clearly, weather was an issue and the calendar shift. But just sort of talk through, I think you said shipments down in the quarter 6%. They're looking like they're up about mid-single digits here in April. Could you just maybe talk through kind of what's your views on inventory in the channel. I'm assuming no real de-stocking going on, but maybe just a broader picture on the core.","Richard A. Noll","Yes, let me just give a high-level picture and then I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk a little bit more specifically in some of the Innerwear trends. For the quarter with the Easter shift, we didn't expect it to be extremely strong quarter. In fact, our sales levels were right about exactly on plan. Now with the weather and things, that's sort of a plus and a minus. It actually negatively impacted Innerwear a little bit. On the flip side, it positively impacted Champion, where we had some stronger fleece sales. So that was all good. So things were, at the highest level, played out a little bit like we thought. But when you get under the covers, it's not exactly as we thought. Let me turn it over to Gerald to talk about some of those trends underneath.","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, Eric, as we look at our Innerwear business, our POS, excluding Maidenform, was down about 2% in the quarter, while our shipments were down 6%. The interesting thing is as soon as we flipped around to that April period of time where we got a little better weather and we got back into the Easter period where it was, it quickly flipped around to the mid-single digits rate that Rich mentioned in his comments. And it really leveled out our POS to be flat for the year in the Innerwear segment. I think it clearly reinforces the point that there may be interruptions or shifts in timing on our -- these core categories, but over time, their consumption is consistent.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And no real incremental pressure on pricing. I mean, obviously, Innovate-to-Elevate in that the innovation is supportive of, but any resistance to some of the pricing out there?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, not at all. And I think even retailers' reactions to sort of the soft Q1 is there was a clear recognition that Easter shifted and they all knew that, that was going to impact the results. And when you have these polar vortex and nor'easters hitting, they were seeing the trends there, but a lot of them were seeing business being fine in southern states like in Florida and so on. So nobody was overly concerned about the short-term softness. This is just a reflection of how the consumer environment has been for the last couple of years. There's good selling periods followed by sort of weak ones. But overall, it tends to be okay, and that's a great thing about our categories. They tend to be pretty stable, and we're feeling good about things.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And if I could just -- switching to Maidenform, one follow-up here. So that integration, it seems to be completed by 2Q. Is there anything -- because I believe at the Analysts Day, it was really just a function of management capacity that was constraining doing another deal. So as we think about the back half, is there anything that would prevent you all from looking at doing something else? And if so, is it -- should we think about it being a little bit smaller tuck-in? Or to the last question, is there an appetite for actually leveraging up and doing something more transformational?","Richard A. Noll","So let me make a couple of points about our thoughts of -- concerning acquisition. You're going to find that pretty much, nothing has changed. Our 4 criteria, which are very strict, are still strongly in place. We're still talking about acquisitions being bolt-on, not huge transformational that would carry a lot of risk. That said, I did say at the investor meeting in late February that our constraint to do the next acquisition was making sure that we got Maidenform fully integrated. And on an acquisition such as that, you'd expect that integration to take about a year or so. The great thing is we've just got a fabulous team, nearly 300 people, working on this integration. They've just done a phenomenal job. I can't brag about them enough. I'm really, really proud of all the great things that they've accomplished. And what that's allowing us to do is substantially reduce the constraints of Maidenform, and it can allow us to turn our attention to another acquisition as the year moves on. We're constantly talking to people. I've said that over and over again. Some deals take a long time, like Gear For Sports, from when we initially talked to them to doing a deal, took 3 years. Some happen very quickly, like Maidenform, 3 months from initial contact to actually signing the deal. So we're out there. We're constantly talking to people that meet our 4 criteria, and when it culminates in a definitive agreement, obviously we'll let you know. The great thing is our core business is just doing extremely well. That's really what's driving our results. I feel great about how the Maidenform synergies will play out over time. And I think we got a lot of long-term prospects that are very bright in front of us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about the improvement. It looks like it improved quite a bit at Maidenform from fourth quarter to first quarter, both in terms of like sales and profitability. What drove that? And then also, I think maybe you increased the profit for the year by $5 million. So maybe talk a little bit about where that's coming from, too.","Richard A. Noll","Sure. Let me talk for just a minute about the profitability on Maidenform. We did -- operating profit was about $6 million in the quarter. That was slightly higher than what we were expecting. That really came primarily from a little better gross profit margin than we expected as we were able to exit some of their underperforming or less profitable businesses a little faster than we thought. You'll see the improvement from an SG&A standpoint later in the year as the integration fully kicks in and those costs are eliminated. And as we've said -- we'd originally given guidance of $25 million for operating profit for the full year. Based on where we are now, we see -- with $5 million to $7 million of upside. So we've incorporated $5 million of that upside, and there could still be more there. It would be a function of us getting some of those costs out a little faster than what we'd originally thought.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then one follow-up. On Innovate-to-Elevate, so it sounds like the Champion business is really driving that. Maybe if you could talk about the products that kind of contributing to that. And then also, if you can maybe talk about your longer-term vision for the brand. It seems like it really has a lot of legroom for growth given Activewear trends out there in the U.S. and then if there's any plans international, too.","Gerald W. Evans","Susan, this is Gerald. The Champion business did have a great quarter, and the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is really taking hold within Champion. And you're right, the Activewear trend is a great trend to ride with and we're riding it with a great brand right now. From the standpoint of our Innovate-to-Elevate initiatives, it's driving expanded distribution within our current accounts, as well as we're gaining a number of new doors. A lot of this new distribution went into place in the first quarter. In combination with, frankly, the cold weather helped this business some. It helped in the fleece business and so forth. So the combination of the extra fleece sales and all these placements gave us an extraordinarily strong first quarter. But you're also right, this brand has a lot of legs, and we do expect it to continue to grow throughout the year, more at a full year rate around 10%. And certainly on an international scale, there is room there as well. We have the brand established in certain markets, but not as well-established as we'd like to see, whether that would be Canada or even some of our -- the markets in Asia where we operate as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Innovate-to-Elevate, clearly, you guys have been talking about it for a while. It's clearly working. How do you think about kind of the upper limitations? Or if there are upper limitations, then how far you can push the envelope in pricing, in innovation and bringing the consumer up the curve? Some of the channels you're in, some of the consumers are a little bit more price-sensitive. That doesn't seem to be having an impact at this point. But how -- like, is this something we're going to be talking about 2, 3, 5, 10 years from now that you're still pushing the envelope on innovation and kind of pricing elevation because it's -- the power of it is really evident right now.","Richard A. Noll","Absolutely. This is something that's there for the long term. And let me remind you, there's 3 components that are critical for Innovate-to-Elevate. It's really taking advantage of your brand power, it's driving platform innovations and then leveraging that global supply chain and all 3 of them work synergistically. So with brands, you need strong brands so that when you do innovation, consumers are willing to actually try the new products. Also, it allows you to have the power as inflation comes at you, which is where clearly apparel is in a situation of dealing with moderate inflation as cost push inflation over time and you've got to have brand power to increase prices to offset that cost push inflation and maintain margin. Innovation's a critical piece of it, looking for consumer segments where people are willing to pay more for products that are better, and we're in very early innings of that. You look at something like X-TEMP or ComfortBlend. I think of our men's underwear business, they're probably less than 12% of the total business right now. We've got a long way to go until those things are fully penetrated throughout just even United States, let alone internationally. And there's our secret sauce, which is that supply chain. And every time we build scale in particular product categories, we're able to reduce our cost, and that allows us to increase our margins. So we're in very early innings of this. You're seeing it be the greatest results where we started the earliest in men's underwear. You're now cascading it to intimate apparel, ultimately to Maidenform, where we won't even see benefits until 2016. And we're now starting to see it really drive results in that Activewear category. So yes, we'll be talking about this for 2, 5, 10 years from now.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And Rich, so to be clear, you're not getting resistance from the retail customers, your retail partners. You're not really seeing any meaningful resistance in terms of the consumers or any research you're doing around the consumers. \"Oh, is this really something I want to pay more for?\" It doesn't seem like you're getting any sort of pushback.","Richard A. Noll","No, and remember, this isn't about driving price up substantially. While in some categories, from an inflation perspective, we did actually raise price anywhere from 3% to 5% on some of our categories, and that's all working fine. So you're talking about small dollar increases to offset inflation. And -- but when you look at ComfortBlend or X-TEMP, I use those as example, where you're pricing 40% to 50% to 70% higher than the core products, not every consumer wants those products. But there's clearly a market where people are willing to pay more for those kind of very special products that deliver higher benefits, and those businesses are doing really well, continue to grow. And as I said, they're low percentages of the current business. So there's a lot of room for growth and continuing to drive our margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura Securities.","Robert Scott Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the 2 questions that I have is, Rich, when you look at the results and the increase in the guidance, I think in the Analysts Meeting in late February, you had talked about sort of a '15 number of right around that $5.25 level. And with the sort of change in the guidance from this year, can you just give us any updated thoughts around sort of a little bit further out, where you are with the business right now? And then the second question that I have is, can you comment a little bit about -- the Champion business seems to be doing very, very well. But any comments around Champion in Canada?","Richard A. Noll","Sure. Let me take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk about Champion in Canada. First, what's driving our increasing guidance is the fact that we just had a great Q1 and we feel really good about those results, and we've got a lot of visibility for the rest of '14. Our prices and space gains are set. Back-to-school is in place with our key retailers. Our holiday plans are very fully developed and almost complete with most of our key retailers. And on the cost side, virtually all of our commodity costs are locked in for, I think, 97%, 98% of the year. So we feel really good about where we are with visibility for the rest of 2014. In terms of what's it looking like for 2015? I did make the comment, as you're talking about, in the low 5s at the Investor Day. I think I was really talking about it in terms of what it might be reasonable to expect, how quickly we can double results and using the numbers historically. And I think we'll wait to any more specific guidance to '15 until we get a little bit closer to '15 starting. That said, we feel really good about the momentum we've got in our business, in our core business, in Maidenform, and we got a very bright future indeed. Gerald, do you want to talk about Champion in...","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, let me talk about Champion in Canada, and in fact, let me just talk a little bit about our international strategies first. We've had a focus on leveraging our scale of the U.S. business more effectively across the borders of both Canada and Mexico to really leverage our regional scale. And we've focused first on Canada, and it really is a good example of the power of what we can do is now bring the power of what we're doing in Champion through our Innovate-to-Elevate and grow that brand even faster in Canada. We are seeing the results now, both with the moving of Target up in to Canada. We've got our Champion at Target now in Canada developing very well. The brand -- the Champion brand is also developing in other channels. But there's a lot of upside there, and that's certainly one of the things we're focused on as we leverage the scale of the U.S. business across the borders.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Quick question for Rick. Just looking at the Q1 results, the gross margin was obviously much better than we expected, and SG&A certainly lower. And I'm just wondering, relative to your kind of original expectations, obviously you commented on the gross margin being driven by Innovate-to-Elevate. I'm just wondering, what other factors are driving that, and whether those, you think, can be sustained potentially to drive upside for the rest of the year? And one of the reasons I ask the question is I'm looking at the Maidenform gross margins last year and looking at the SG&A dollars, particularly in the first half, and wondering how you guys are getting -- recognizing those benefits sooner? And -- because I had thought that the Maidenform gross margins would be more of a negative mix factor for you guys this year. Any color on that would be appreciated.","Richard D. Moss","Sure. Let me start with gross margins. The improvement really came both in the core business and in Maidenform being a little better than we thought. The core business was driven by Innovate-to-Elevate. It was our ability to get the price to cover inflation and to maintain margins. It was innovation mixed us up, mixed us -- resulted in positive mix, let me be clear about that. And then our supply chain efficiencies were actually better than what we expected. So those things all contributed to really very nice margin improvement for the quarter there. In terms of SG&A, the -- let me kind of break that down for you. It was up, in dollar terms, about $15 million. Maidenform accounted for $26 million of that. We also added $2 million of additional media spend over last year. But that $26 million for Maidenform was about what we expected it to be. You'll really start to see that numbers come down as we go through the year. And the integration, the financial impact of the integration benefits that Gerald talked about really kick in. So that's where you'll start to see that as we get into the second quarter, and then beyond, you'll see the improvements in SG&A for Maidenform. But the base business is actually down $13 million on SG&A, a really nice cost control for the quarter. So we look at all those dynamics, David, and we feel -- causes us to feel very good about where we will be for the full year. If you take the midpoint of our operating profit margin guidance and you divide it by $5.1 billion of sales, then you come up with about a 13.2% operating profit margin, which is 30 basis points higher than what we were last year and was actually higher than what we had originally guided to. So we believe we can keep moving the margin up.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So on the gross margin side, I thought it would be unlikely to get an increase based on the Maidenform benefits not coming till next year and having a negative mix effect. Based on the Q1 performance, can you guys maintain the gross margin or increase it this year? Is that baked into your plan?","Richard D. Moss","Well, we don't give guidance on gross profit margin. But we feel good about what we accomplished. We think Innovate-to-Elevate is going to continue to drive margin improvement throughout our P&L.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from CL King & Associates.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rick, you just mentioned the operating margin at 13% for the year midpoint versus guidance as well. Can you talk a little bit about what the ultimate earnings power is assuming a steady state? In other words, assuming no additional acquisitions?","Richard D. Moss","We've historically talked about an operating profit margin goal of 12% to 14%. We continue to move steadily towards the top end of that. I think as we continue to integrate Maidenform, we'll have a clearer picture on what we think the longer-term operating profit goals are. But I think what you're seeing is that Innovate-to-Elevate and our focus on strong cost containment are -- these are things that we can continue to execute for the foreseeable future.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. That's great. And can you comment also on the upward drift to raw cotton prices over the past 6 to 8 months or so and how that's affecting your cost structure and what you think pricing will be as a result of that?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. There's always -- in the cotton market, there's always a certain amount of volatility that's normal. And honestly, what we've seen in the last few months really kind of within that normal range of volatility and we plan for that in our P&L. And obviously, we generally stay 6 to 9 months ahead on hedge -- on our hedges for that. So we have good visibility to it. As Rich said, we have almost all of our cotton hedged for this year. So we really know kind of what that cotton cost is going to be.","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, and I would just add to that, Steve. This is Gerald. As we've said before, we've anticipated a level of inflation working its way into the manufacturing supply chain now, and we priced early in the year in anticipation of raw material movements but also wage movements and put those prices in place in February.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great quarter from the Activewear side. My compliments to the Champion team. The increased confidence in the operating profit for the year, can you talk about how you're thinking about that by segment? Is it the acceleration that you're seeing in the Activewear segment that was the principal contributor to your increased confidence?","Richard A. Noll","Jim, in terms of talking about operating profit expectations by segment, we don't give guidance at that level. Suffice it to say, I think we feel really good about all facets of our business. I think Innovate-to-Elevate, as we cascade it through, is driving all of our operating margins up. We feel really good about Champion or the entire Activewear segment. Innerwear is doing well. And so -- but in terms of by specific segment guidance, we don't want to really go there.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. Rick, follow-up question on the SG&A. A large part of the year-to-year reduction in the SG&A looks to be in the corporate overhead line. Can you kind of explain where some of those savings are coming from and speak to the additional opportunities in corporate overhead?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. The savings are coming in basically in personnel and related types of costs around that. That's the corporate overhead section. That's where -- that's what most of it is. In terms of our future ability, we're always looking for opportunities to reduce our overhead spending and to leverage the resources that we have to accommodate growth on the top line.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Danielle McCoy from Brean Capital.","Danielle McCoy - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Quick question, how is Hanes doing in Macy's? How many doors is it currently in? And can we expect any door expansion in that mid-tier channel?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, Hanes Platinum is doing quite well at Macy's. In fact, you'll see a further expansion of doors in the second half of this year. You'll also see the introduction of Hanes Platinum panties in retail as well. So that business is growing nicely. And I think, again, it always speak to the power of the Hanes brand that it spans channels from the department stores right down to dollar stores.","Danielle McCoy - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. And then just on Maidenform, how far have you guys gotten with the SKU reduction? And have you witnessed any floor expansion in any of the stores? And I guess just a little update on the shapewear and Maidenform with Spanx?","Gerald W. Evans","We've made a great deal of progress on our SKU reduction. There was quite a bit of low-quality revenue that we said going in that we would shed, and with that comes SKUs. We said it would fall sort of a $500 million base, which we're still very comfortable with and that's the base from which we will begin to grow. Our focus is on making fewer, bigger statements on the floor across all of our businesses, including intimate apparel. We've begun work on that process with our retailers, and we're in the early stages of that. They love the idea, and we think it will be very effective in offering a better assortment of styles and colors. I'm sorry, I forgot the third part of your question.","Richard A. Noll","The Spanx.","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, the shapewear. Yes, as we've said since we bought that -- bought Maidenform, that it would play out over time. There were some competitive space gains that would play out over time, and that's playing out exactly like we thought it would. There's a little more time to go before we overlap where those competitive entries began, but we think that we're in good shape and over time, we'll grow that business as we bring our Innovate-to-Elevate strategies to that business as well.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. One, I'm wondering if you're changing the assortment at all at JCPenney as we move through the year. And then also, just a follow-up on your cash flow, your priorities for cash for the -- as you look at the business. You've talked a bit about M&A. Is there anything else we should be watching for?","Gerald W. Evans","We -- starting with JCPenney, we have continued to rebuild the assortment there as they return to their past strategies, and we're having a lot of success across both Basics. And also, Champion entered on the men's side in JCPenney and is performing very well.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of priorities for cash flow, obviously, our first priority is always to invest in our own business, and we've talked about gross capital expenditures this year being in that $60 million to $75 million range. And you should expect that to migrate up towards depreciation, amortization close to $90 million to $100 million per year over time. The second priority is to, we've instituted dividend and obviously, we need to support that dividend and we've talked about having a target payout ratio between 25% and 30%. So as earnings per share would continue to grow, you may see the dividend increase. And after that, the other priorities are to think about bolt-on acquisitions that can create value that are focused on our 4 criteria that we've talked about historically. And then lastly, we'd also think about share repurchases. Debt pay down used to be a priority, but since we got that to where we wanted it to be -- obviously, it's fallen off the list.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to T.C. Robillard for any concluding comments.","T.C.

For today's call, Gerald and Rick will provide some brief remarks and then we'll open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have re-accelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions, both past and present, are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance.","Our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant value for our shareholders. The real power of our model comes from its diversification. We have a variety of different levers that allow us to consistently grow both revenue and earnings per share, while at the same time, generate significant amounts of cash flow. It's not just one strategy or one facet of our business. It's a number of them working together that drive strong, consistent results. This was evident, once again, in our third quarter as three different levers combined to drive an 11% increase in revenue, a 12% increase in earnings per share and a record level of cash flow from operations.","The first lever contributing to our strong results was our focus-on-the-core initiative. If you recall at the beginning of the year, we highlighted various sales initiatives to drive second half growth in parts of our core. And these initiatives delivered as we saw accelerated organic growth across several of our business lines. For the quarter, our basics revenue increased 9% organically driven by a 20% growth in men's underwear as we gained market share and begin to flow in shipments of our new odor control innovation FreshIQ. Year-to-date, our basics business is up 2% organically and we expect momentum to continue through the fourth quarter as our holiday promotions are in place and we begin to advertise behind FreshIQ.","Global Champion for the quarter delivered low single digit organic revenue growth driven by low double-digit growth in the mass channel and strong double-digit organic growth in Japan. And in terms of our U.S. online business, sales across all channels increased 17% in the quarter.","The second lever of our business model that drove strong third quarter results was our acquisition strategy. We continued to generate significant synergies from our prior acquisitions including Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform, which continues to create synergies even three years after closing. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our target of $40 million in acquisition synergies. We also benefited from the addition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. Both businesses drove revenue and operating profit results that exceeded our plan, further reinforcing our excitement about these acquisitions. These are great businesses, with great brands and very strong management teams that are already creating value for our shareholders. We remain on schedule with the integration planning and we're confident in our ability to deliver over $125 million in combined annual operating profit within three years.","And the third lever of our business model that drove strong results in the quarter was our cash generation strategy. When we exited the fourth quarter last year, the weather-driven slowdown created an inventory overhang that temporarily impacted our cash flow. While there have been some skeptics, we communicated a specific strategy to reduce inventory and generate record-levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we've done. Inventory in the quarter excluding recent acquisitions declined significantly from the second quarter's level, which in turn helped drive $337 million in cash flow from operations. And as we expected, our acquisition and integration expenses continued to decline, all of which keeps us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.","So in summary, we had a great quarter, and this combined with our full year outlook represents further proof that our business model is as strong as ever and continues to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we believe we are extremely well positioned to deliver on average mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered strong operating results for the quarter. Our sales initiatives reaccelerated organic growth across multiple business lines. Our inventory reduction actions generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our acquisitions, both past and present, posted better than expected profit results. And our acquisition and integration related expenses continued to decline.","Now let me walk you through the specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 11% over last year, and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions contributed nicely as Champion Europe, Pacific Brands and the acquired Champion license in Japan added approximately $180 million of revenue in the quarter.","We delivered strong organic growth in several business lines, including basics, Champion at mass, Gear for Sports, Champion Japan and online. This growth was offset by a decline in Champion in the sports specialty channel as well as a decline in our U.S. direct-to-consumer business where we're proactively transitioning to a growth model by exiting our legacy catalog business and removing noncore offerings.","Looking at our two largest segments, Innerwear sales increased 2% organically in the quarter. Our basics business was up 9% over last year, including a 20% increase in men's underwear. This strong organic growth was driven by our various focus-on-the-core sales initiatives, including increased marketing and promotion as well as the launch of FreshIQ, the first innovation in our core in over a decade. Year-to-date, our basics business is up 2% with the growth evenly balanced across all product categories. This is partially offset by the expected decline in intimates as we anniversaried the large pipe of Hanes Bras in last year's third quarter.","Turning to our Activewear segment, sales declined 2% in the quarter. Our Champion business at mass increased by over 10% organically as our refreshed product offering continues to resonate with consumers. Gear for Sports, which is our college bookstore business, also delivered organic growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits over last year. This growth was more than offset by declines in Champion in the sports specialty channel due to the bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers in the U.S. While we're disappointed with the results in this channel, we believe the headwind is temporary. More importantly, we expect this channel to return to growth in 2017 as our POS trends remain positive at key accounts. We've secured new space, and we lapped the impact from the bankruptcies.","Switching to margins, now that our inventory-related actions are behind us, as expected, our gross margins returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 60 basis points over last year, while operating margins decreased 40 basis points due to the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. Adjusting for these acquisitions, operating margins increased 30 basis points over last year, driven by synergies from Hanes Europe, Knights Apparel and Maidenform. Interest and other expense increased roughly $13 million over last year as a result of the higher debt balances associated with the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pac Brands.","The tax rate in the quarter was roughly 6%, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 7%, which is in line with our full-year expectation of a high single digit rate. Earnings per share of $0.56 increased 12% over last year and came in at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Turning to inventory and cash flow, inventory in the quarter, excluding approximately $173 million from recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $124 million from second quarter's level, as our actions to reduce inventory continued to deliver results. This in turn helped generate $337 million in cash flow from operations, a record for any quarter in our history. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is roughly $300 million higher than last year, which puts us right on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance for the full year.","Touching briefly on guidance, while still within our initial range, we've narrowed our full-year outlook. This reflects the expected retailer caution heading into the holiday season. If holiday is, in fact, more robust, then that would represent upside to our guidance. At the midpoint, our guidance now implies approximately 8% growth in revenue, roughly 10% growth in operating profit, approximately 15% growth in EPS and $775 million in cash flow from operations. In terms of acquisition and integration related charges, our guidance of approximately $180 million remains unchanged and represents a decline of nearly $90 million from last year. Looking to next year, despite the addition of nearly $1 billion in acquisitions this year, we expect these charges to take another significant step down in 2017 as we benefit from integration efficiencies and leverage our prior foundational investments.","So in closing, let me end right where Gerald began. We're having a great year. Our sales initiatives have re-accelerated organic growth in several of our core business lines. Our acquisitions, both past and present, are performing extremely well. Our inventory level is declining and cash flow from operations is already $300 million ahead of last year. Overall, our business is tracking to our plan and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing in the core mass channel in the U.S. How do you feel about inventories in the channel? And how has your growth thinking been changing over the course of the year? What are your expectations as you look towards the end of the year and 2017?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Christian, this is Gerald. Let me take that question. First of all I want to say that the year is really unfolding as we expected. We had a great Q3. We've put a number of sales initiatives in early in the year and they've begun to take hold and really helped drive that strong result in the quarter, up 11% in total revenue growth and up 12% in EPS. Those sales initiatives resulted in driving very strong basics results for us in the quarter, up 9%, up 2% year to date. And we see that momentum only continuing to build in the basics business as we have a number of events planned for the fourth quarter behind our key launches like our FreshIQ and for the holiday period.","We've also seen a pretty strong improvement in our Activewear business sequentially from quarter to quarter. And when you back out the impact of sporting goods bankruptcies, you see very strong, actually a 1% increase in Activewear for the quarter and really strong performance out of our Champion at mass business, as well as positive improvement in our Hanes Activewear business. And also our online growth showed very positive growth, up 17%, which is actually an accelerated rate over where we've been year-to-date. When we look at specific channels, certainly we had a very strong back-to-school period, as indicated by our Q3 results and continued our share gains in core areas like underwear and socks. So from the mass channel perspective, we feel that it's performing very well for us. We came out of the back-to-school period with our inventories in line. So we feel that with the momentum we're carrying into Q4, as well as our inventories in line and the basics initiatives we have that we've got a good strong performance that will carry into Q4 in mass as well.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the acquisitions you made this year? What have you learned as you've gotten deeper into understanding those businesses? Where have the surprise areas been for you?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, I think for both Champion Europe and Pacific Brands, we've been very pleased with the strengths of the businesses themselves and certainly the management that came with those businesses. You may recall that both of these acquisitions very effectively balance cost synergies, as well as growth opportunities. And we see that our expectations for both are in line. And certainly we've seen actually in Q3 we saw a little better performance out of both than we had anticipated. And as we look to the fourth quarter, their business skews a little more heavily to the fourth quarter. So you'll see even a little more impact out of them in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Brean.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys, thanks and congrats on delivering in a difficult environment. If I could follow up on just what's going on within the Innerwear category, obviously delivered here with the FreshIQ platform. Gerald, maybe just speak to kind of the dynamic between selling into mass, traditional brick-and-mortar versus kind of the evolution of the third-party online. It looks like you guys are transitioning some of the segmenting next year, so maybe just talk about that dynamic and how you guys are positioned to kind of capitalize on that.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Certainly, the power of our sales initiative showed across all channels when you look at the Innerwear business across basics. With that kind of lift, certainly it touched every channel. We do continue to see a shift of apparel sales in general, online and our categories are shifting with them. As we've discussed before, we hold the number one share position in our core categories online. We saw very solid growth, really at about 2x the rate of total apparel growth was our growth trend within the quarter. It is what caused us to take some of our actions within our DTC business. That's a relatively small business for us and that business really contains the U.S. outlet stores, as well as our own websites and legacy catalog business. So, frankly, we're taking the step there, as well, to exit that catalog business which has been masking the double-digit growth within our websites and position that business along with our other segments to grow as apparel shifts online. So, that's a strategic decision we've made to drive growth as well. So we feel good about the direction of Innerwear and we feel good about the momentum we carry into Q4.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital LLC","And then if I could just touch on cash flow, the build year-to-date here should hopefully put to bed some of those concerns around last year's 4Q depressed level, and really is a working cap inventory. But how do you get us sort of comfortable that that continues? I'm assuming the assumption for next year's free cash is at the same level if not higher, but truly kind of these working cap adjustments sort of behind us.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes. Sure. Let me take that. If you look at our guidance, it implies that the fourth quarter is going to generate about $550 million to $600 million of cash flow from operations. Remember that our fourth quarter is normally a disproportionately large percentage of our annual cash flow because of the way the business runs. But let me break that down for you, kind of give you a sense of where that $550 million to $600 million is coming from. About $250 million of it is coming from net income and other non-cash items like depreciation and amortization. If you take our guidance for the fourth quarter, you'll get to those kinds of numbers. The balance of it, about $300 million to $350 million, will come primarily from working capital. The bulk of it from continued inventory reductions, as we continue to drive our inventory reduction plans, as well as the normal AR reductions that we always see in Q4. So that will be the majority of it. We get a little pickup from accounts payable and a little here and there as well. So very confident, though, that we're going to get to the numbers that we've been talking about.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. A quick cleanup question. I saw the acquisition contribution guidance change a little bit. I assume that's the GTM sportswear deal, that there was some press around in September. I just want to confirm that. And does that \u2013 since you kept this topline the same, does that imply that the organic number maybe is a little bit lower than you had previously thought?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, let me first say, as Gerald said a little earlier, the acquisitions, Pac Brands and Champion Europe are doing better than we expected and that's really constituting the bulk of the difference in our expectations for acquisitions in the year.","In terms of GTM, as you'll see in our 10-Q, we did a couple of very small tuck-in acquisitions towards the end of the quarter that'll have really a minimal contribution in terms of revenue; really, none in terms of profit. These are really more longer-term, strategic types of things; one that helps us expand our sports apparel business into the high school channel; the other represents the acquisition of some stores in Italy and the geography that we're not currently in. And so these are complementary to what we've been doing to our current business and so we see them as fairly short term, but not nearly as big of an impact on us as the Champion Europe and Pac Brands businesses.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got you. That's really helpful, Rick, thanks. And then quick question on the \u2013 follow-up on the Basics business, the Innerwear business, the Basics piece versus the Intimates piece. The Basics number was really quite strong and I think that's a bigger piece, so I'm just trying to kind of triangulate what we're talking about with Intimates and how we got comfortable that it's really just a shift in the compare to last year when you shipped in all those products, and there's not something else going on in the category?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. And certainly from the Basics standpoint, there were a number of initiatives that drove that kind of lift. You're right, that's a great lift on the business and we think with all the initiatives we've got behind FreshIQ going into the fourth quarter and advertising starting next week that that'll be a great momentum builder that'll carry forward.","In the case of Intimates, for Q3 it was down as we anniversaried the large pipe of our Hanes bra business. You may recall that this pipe contributed to a 9% growth in intimates in last year's Q3, so fairly big lift last year. We feel good about the brand positioning with Hanes and so forth, and the Hanes business continues to capture share. I think from the standpoint of trying to ferret the noise out there a little bit, if you take out that noise and you look back two years, we were actually up a little over two points over a two-year ago period when we didn't have the noise of the pipe in it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. Good evening. Good job on the quarter. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on just the replenishment trends you're seeing out there at the department stores. We've been hearing a lot about them taking down inventory and just wondering if that's been impacting you guys. And then, also, if you could maybe comment on the mass channel?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes, from the standpoint of inventories, we came out of Q2 with our inventories in line and, as we went into back-to-school, our builds went in as expected. And we finished with our inventories in line. So we haven't really been experiencing across any of the channels any major pull downs in inventory. As we've said all year, we felt our inventories were in line, and our customers were replenishment business, so they generally reorder what we sell. And so we're in pretty good shape from an inventory standpoint.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. That's good to hear. And then in terms of the bankruptcies, was the impact a little bit worse than you guys had thought this quarter? And I guess when do you guys think that will taper off?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","It was about as expected in the quarter. We'll start to see the number drop next quarter, and then we lap it in Q1 of next year.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I think we'll all be happy to have that behind us.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. And then maybe if you could just talk about for fourth quarter the puts and takes on gross margin and SG&A just for our model, how we should be thinking about that?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. In terms of \u2013 if you do the math on the guidance at the center point of our guidance, it would imply an operating margin improvement of about 150 basis points. Most of that's going to come from gross margin as that continues to increase, as we've said it would in the second half of the year. But it will be a combination of the same sorts of things, Susan, that we've been seeing driving gross margin improvement for the last several years. It's cost savings in our manufacturing facilities, it's synergies, it's strong management of our overhead costs, Innovate-to-Elevate, all of those things will continue to contribute in Q4.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. My question's on inventory. You mentioned doing a great job driving inventory reductions. Did you end the quarter on an organic basis where you thought? Can you just give us an idea of where you are on those plans and maybe where you expect to be organically versus last year at the end of fourth quarter?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. So we ended Q3 down about 70 million units versus last year. The dollar amount is we were up about $15 million organically year-over-year. The inventory mix was a little richer than maybe we had expected. But it was within our range of expectations for the quarter. So really no surprises, per se. In terms of where we expect to be, I would say, you should expect us to be down year-over-year by the end of the fourth quarter $100 million to $150 million on inventory.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then if I can ask about the guidance, it sounds like the small adjustment you made to the guidance was \u2013 sounded like based on an outlook for 4Q, based on the retail environment that's out there right now. And it's really not about something that happened in 3Q. Is that fair to say or was there some aspect of 3Q that made you want to shift the guidance? And if there was, what was it?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, I would say the shift in guidance was really pretty modest. A question was asked earlier about the revenue from acquisitions. That will be a little higher than maybe we originally thought, but we're still talking about organic growth in the quarter of 2% to 4%. So it's still really pretty much in line with what we thought.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter. Gerald and Rick, just curious if you could talk a little bit about the marketing approach around FreshIQ. Now that the channel is filled, sounds like we should see some investment around demand creation there. So I guess what's your thought process around where you want to spend those dollars? And in the past, when you've launched a new platform, how does that trajectory work? Meaning initial sell-in takes place and people are walking into stores, but then marketing comes in behind it. Have you historically seen an uptick in POS when that takes place or is it more steady than that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes. This is Gerald. Let me just take that. So we've been flowing FreshIQ in for, really, through the third quarter, and as we now enter the fourth quarter, it's all in position and we will do a big launch behind it. We'll do a combination of TV and digital advertising. In fact, some of the digital efforts started two weeks ago. We'll turn the TV on next week, and along with that we'll do a number of off-shelf displays that'll encourage trial and bonus packs and those kind of things to get the consumer to give it a try. This is a big launch for us. It goes across our core underwear and socks as well. We really haven't done a launch like that since tagless tee over 10 years ago and this really reaches a broad base of consumers.","As we turn on the TV and we encourage that trial, this is a product that's built on one of the biggest concerns of the consumer, and so as you offer them that odor elimination option, it creates a real reason for trial that we're going to back up with great advertising and promotion packs. We get the trial and we tend to see the repeat. And, of course, we're now launching it in one of the highest traffic periods of the year. So we would expect it to ramp up and get trial and repeat over the next few quarters.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then just doing some store work, it seems like there's not a big pricing premium on that product right now. Is that something that you could look at in the future once you see how demand trends go, or is this not supposed to be a higher AUR product, and it's just supposed to drive replenishment?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","It is across the core business as well as our trade-up styles and it's a modest increase at this point.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just a quick question on the model here. So you mentioned the Champ in sport specialty retail returning to growth in 2017 despite the bankruptcies this year. Would you mind just reminding us how much revenue you will have recorded in 2016 related to those bankruptcies just so we can think about? It sounds like you're returning to positive even while wrapping around booking some revenue from those retailers in 2016.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","The TSA business historically was about $35-ish million a year. We didn't really get much this year because it was in the very early stages of the year as they were \u2013 just before they went into bankruptcy. So there really wasn't much this year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then would you mind just elaborating, maybe give us a little thought on what gives you confidence on returning to organic revenue growth, or at least flat here, just given some of the commentary we've heard around the channel here lately?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Organic growth within...","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I guess just the way that you guys recorded on the top line organic growth in your biggest channel.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well from the standpoint of the momentum we're building through our initiatives, we've seen that strong positive result of our sales initiatives with our Basics business. And we think that momentum will continue to drive forward and carry Innerwear into Q4. From the standpoint of our Activewear business, what we see is the momentum has stepped up from Q2 to Q3. And we think there'll be additional sequential improvement as we look to Q4, driven by the improving trends within Hanes Activewear and our Champion at mass business, as well as further improvement in our Champion business in sporting goods as the headwinds of the bankruptcy are smaller in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. And let me add my congrats as well. I guess two quick questions. With acquisitions coming in ahead of plan here in the back half, should we think about contribution from the new businesses next year above that $800 million range you guys originally outlined and any initial color or how should we think about the synergies for 2017? And also just coming into this year, I think we talked about margin expansion being more SG&A driven. As we approach 2017, do you think we should expect a more balanced approach between gross margin and SG&A? Thanks.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, I don't really want to comment much on 2017. We're still in the process of putting our plans together. And we'll obviously be giving guidance on 2017 on our next call.","We are very pleased with the trends that we have seen in generating synergies from our acquisitions. Every one of our acquisitions is running ahead of plan in terms of the synergies that we're seeing. So we think our integration efforts are being very successful. And we expect to be able to continue to drive those.","I think a lot of the drivers of margin improvement in the past couple of years will continue on. We've said that we don't really see those as having finite terms. So we'll continue to generate cost savings for our manufacturing facilities. We'll continue to generate synergies. I-to-E will continue to generate gross profit improvement. So all of those drivers will continue on into the future. So we'll be giving you a little more color on that as we get to the 2017 guidance on the next call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry if I missed it, but can you elaborate on the growth-oriented brand strategy you mentioned with regards to DTC? And then just can you talk to, just given the moving pieces within Activewear and Champion, can you talk to where you expect those margins to go? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the DTC question. DTC is really a U.S.-based business. It's relatively small for us. It includes our outlet stores, it includes our legacy catalog business, and it includes our own websites that we operate. What we've chosen to do is proactively shift it to a growth strategy by exiting the legacy catalog business that's been in decline for some period of time, and it's really masking the double-digit growth we're seeing out of our websites, as it follows the trend of so many online in showing growth. And so we've taken that step to transition out of that catalog business. It creates a short-term headwind, but it allows us to position ourself for long-term growth. Do you want to take the margin question, Rick?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","On Activeware.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. As the volume recovers from the bankruptcies, you'll begin to see the margins return to a more appropriate mix for that business, where the richer-margin products have a much larger share of the sales for that segment.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen and Co.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hey, John.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Can you just help us understand what we should expect from the Innerwear and Activewear segments in terms of total revenue growth for the fourth quarter and in terms of what's embedded in your guidance?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. I think you should expect in the fourth quarter \u2013 you should expect to see, as we said \u2013 factoring out the acquisitions numbers that we gave you \u2013 about 2% to 4% top line organic growth in the quarter. That we expect to continue to see Innerwear contribute to that growth, and we expect to see Activewear actually return to growth in the quarter. So those will be the two big drivers. International we expect to continue to do very well. Our Asia business has been very successful even outside of the acquisition that we did in Japan. So all that momentum that Gerald talked about earlier is really what we think will be driving us through the fourth quarter.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just to revisit the Activewear margins, I think you've got a pretty difficult comparison year-over-year in terms of profitability in Activewear. Can you help us understand how Activewear margins should flow in the fourth quarter, given you're still cycling some of the bankruptcies?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, the bankruptcies though will be less of an issue in Q4. So I think you'll see the margins in Activewear normalize in Q4.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one more question. Congrats on the progress on the cash flow. Can you just confirm that cash is going to be domestic based cash? I think at the end of last year your cash balance was almost entirely international. Does all that cash flow flow through to domestic business?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","You know, I don't want to get into the exact geography of the cash. I will tell you this, we don't consider any of our cash to be trapped on a long-term basis. Some of the cash is in some countries where it takes a little longer to get it out because of the way the bureaucracy in a country works. But we don't consider any of our cash to be trapped. With our global supply chain, with our acquisition activities, we try to position the cash where we need it, when we need it. We haven't had a problem yet.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just a clarification on that long-term algorithm you gave on revenues and EPS of mid single-digits on the top line on double-digit EPS. That mid single-digit is a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, correct?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Correct, yeah.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And just to follow up on FreshIQ, I've been looking at some of your wholesale partner websites and the only website I really see FreshIQ on is Hanes.com. I mean, is that something that you launched that we should see more of a presence in terms of showing the product online at your retail partners?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, it's really, David, beginning to step up now from the standpoint of featuring so that the product flowed in over the quarter at retail and we began the advertising activity and the digital activity as we move to next week and I'm sure the product will be listed there as well.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just had one more I wanted to follow up. It sounds like the progress on the deals, both the current ones and the ones from a few years ago are progressing as planned. Have you thought about \u2013 maybe what you can share with us about how you might consider the timing of a future deal? Are the progress that you're making integrating these different companies happening faster? Does that accelerate the time line? What can you share with us about that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, first we are deep in the efforts to refine and finish our integration strategies on Pacific Brands and Champion Europe and we will make sure that we get those right, and we are able to deliver the synergies both growth and cost synergies. And we'll never put anything in front of that. That said, acquisitions are an important part of our value creation strategy and will continue to be so in the future. And we're always out talking to people, and when the time's right, we'll announce one.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from C.L. King & Associates.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question. Gerald, you talked about the step up in organic growth in the fourth quarter. And considering the challenges in general bookings that we're hearing for the first half of 2017, can you comment a little bit on the orders that you have in hand and what you would expect from an organic growth standpoint, at least in the first half of the year from what you have some visibility on? Thank you.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we're really not projecting into 2017 at this point. We'll be providing guidance for that as we come to our next call, but what I would say at this point in time is that the vast majority of our business is also replenishable, so that shelf space will be in place and we'll see that as the consumers return. We do see good momentum building in our Activewear business as we overlap the bankruptcies and so forth, and we are beginning to gain space in that Champion business, in sporting goods which gives us optimism there.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Sorry, one quick question to follow. Most of my questions have been answered, but can you just give us a little more color on the cadence in the quarter in terms of the traffic what you're hearing from retailers?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","In the third quarter?","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, what we saw sort of as we worked through back-to-school, is back-to-school built to an early peak in August before dropping back a bit and returned a bit in September then softened again. So it's sort of what we've seen all along. It's sort of good periods followed by weak periods. Some retailers had one week that was better than another. And overall, we saw that, as we've seen for a while that back-to-school has extended itself so it really runs now from July all the way through September.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one question on when you're talking about direct-to-consumer, when you're selling to an online or when you talk about online business, are you including sales to like an Amazon or an online-only customer as well or is that just your own online?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","When we talk to the direct-to-consumer as to where we're winding down our catalog and our direct-to-consumer division that is our websites only. When we talk about our online sales that are growing at 17%, and now 8% of our sales, that includes all sales online which includes our sites, it includes our sales to pure plays, as well as our sales to brick and mortar websites.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking me on a quick follow-up. Rick, I meant to ask you before, would you mind helping us elaborate on your comments on the charges coming down next year. I know it's early but since it's been such a big topic and you guys have tried really hard to help us offline, is there any way you could get us some kind of a sense of the broad-brush strokes that you're trying to target for next year, as far as where those charges come down to so we can think about it?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, well, I'm not quite ready to give you an exact number yet. We'll do that when we give guidance for next year on the next call. But what we have been saying is that we do expect to see a substantial drop next year. It's going to be driven, really, by three things. We're getting more and more efficient at these integrations. We're just getting better at it. The more that we do, the better we get. The second thing is we're doing a great job of leveraging the things that we learn from one acquisition into the next. So we're able to leverage those foundational investments and, again, the things that we learn from one deal to the next. And then the ones that we've most recently acquired, Pac Brands and Champion Europe, are really going to be less complex, we think, in terms of integration versus some of the ones that have done earlier in our process. So I think you'll see a nice drop in XA (44:49) charges next year and then beyond that.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you and we have time for one more question. Our final question for today is a follow up from the line of Eric Tracy of Brean.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up, as well, on the question as it relates to mid single-digits revenue growth. Again, I know you're not going to guide to next year's revenues, but there's no change to the acquisition contribution from Champion Europe or Pacific Brands meaning that that should still wrap around to the next year. And assuming any level of organic growth, just by the math, would imply a higher than that mid single-digit rev growth for next year. So I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any change. I know you're not speaking to 2017.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Eric. I appreciate the clarification, or the opportunity to clarify that. When we talked about that mid single-digit number, we're talking about that as a long term number. That's been the long term CAGR for the last five to ten years, we look at that, but obviously next year the revenue from Pac Brands and Champion Europe will be substantial and will be a big push for the top line.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital LLC","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Hanes management for any closing comments.","T.C.

For today's call, Gerald and Rick will provide some brief remarks and then we'll open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. Hanesbrands delivered another year of strong results. Revenue increased 5%, earnings per share grew 11%. We generated over $600 million in cash flow from operations, completed over $1 billion of acquisitions and returned nearly $550 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","But 2016 wasn't without its challenges, particularly in the fourth quarter. Last year in the U.S. roughly 1,200 retail doors closed, several retailers filed for bankruptcy, and there was further inventory tightening as the retail industry continue to adjust to the disruption caused by the shift to online.","For the quarter, our revenue grew 12% and our EPS grew 20%. These are very strong results, but they were clearly below our expectations and we're not at all satisfied with that. The reason for the shortfall was straight forward, while our domestic online revenue growth rate across all channels accelerated to 28% in the quarter. The current scale of our online business was not enough to offset the pressures in U.S. brick-and-mortar.","Store traffic trends during the holiday came in below even our various expectations and a large mass retailer cut replenishment orders in the key November and December periods. Both of these impacted our revenue and profit in the quarter. Despite the headwinds and a challenging fourth quarter, we were still able to deliver record results for the full-year through a combination of acquisitions, execution of our online growth strategy, synergies from prior deals, product innovation and strong working capital management.","Our results provide further proof that our multifaceted business model is designed to create significant long-term returns for our shareholders, irrespective of the overall end market environment. So as we look forward, we expect the overall retail environment in the U.S. to remain challenging, as the ongoing channel disruption drives additional store closings and tighter inventory management.","That said, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through these near-term challenges. Our international business, which is expected to be roughly 30% of our revenue in 2017, continues to grow. We are aggressively growing our online business, as we continue to consolidate the fragmented market share.","And our multifaceted business model generates strong consistent cash flow that drives a balanced return centric capital allocation strategy. All of this gives us confidence that we can deliver another year of solid growth despite the challenging environment. At the midpoint, our guidance calls for 8% revenue growth, 7% EPS growth and cash flow from operations that is approaching $700 million.","And our confidence is driven by four things. First, we have the wrap, from last year's acquisitions in the first half, as well as approximately $15 million of expected synergies from prior acquisitions.","Second, we'll continue to aggressively follow the consumer. Over the past several years, we have reallocated resources to grow online across all channels and it's working. Our online revenue growth accelerated in each quarter last year as our market shares expanded. Moreover, we consistently outpaced growth in the online apparel category. Online revenue across all channels was 11% of our domestic sales in the quarter. And revenue from a large online pure-play grew at a strong double-digit rate last year, making them our fifth largest customer.","As the online pace accelerates this year, we'll continue to shift our internal resources. So we're positioned to remain ahead of the growth curve. For example, we'll broaden our assortments across all online channels and we'll continue to shift our media budget, with digital expected to represent over half of our total media spend in 2017.","A third source of our confidence is that we'll build on the momentum of our core business fundamentals. Within Innerwear, we'll continue to push our focus on the core initiative in basics. This initiative is working as we gain market share last year driven by our FreshIQ innovation. While still early on a like-for-like basis, retailers experienced an uptick in point-of-sale trends with our FreshIQ products when compared to our prior offerings.","In Activewear, Global Champion revenue growth accelerated up 10% in the quarter driven by Europe, Asia and U.S. mass business. For 2017, Activewear is well-positioned to return to growth as we anniversary the sporting goods bankruptcies benefit from our Global Champion growth initiatives and expand distribution within our Licensed Sports Apparel business.","And fourth, we plan more conservatively within the bricks-and-mortar channels for 2017. The shift online is not only pressuring store traffic, but it's also reshaping traditional shopping patterns as store visits are becoming more concentrated around key promotion events. Therefore, we're going to be more targeted with our promotions and we're planning for tighter inventory management at retail.","Before I wrap up, let me touch briefly on our capital allocation strategy as it relates to 2017. Last week, we increased our dividend by 36%, reflecting confidence in our ability to consistently drive growth in earnings per share and cash flow from operations.","Given the current dislocation in our stock price, you should also expect us to be buying back shares and with respect to acquisitions our focus in the early part of the year is on integrating the portfolio of acquisitions we completed last year.","So in summary, we delivered another year of record revenue, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. While the continued evolution of the U.S. consumer has created a challenging retail backdrop, we believe we're extremely well positioned to win in this environment.","We're broadly distributed, including online and internationally. We operate in heavily branded replenishment categories, where we hold the number one or number two brand. We're delivering successful innovation, we own our supply chain, which provides us low cost manufacturing and the flexibility to navigate a variety of economic and political environment.","We generated a significant amount of cash flow and we employ a disciplined, return-centric approach to deploying our cash. All of which positions us to deliver another year of strong returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. When we entered 2016, you may recall that we took a very cautious view of the overall U.S. consumer environment, particularly the holiday period. Unfortunately, the environment proved to be more challenging than even our various assumptions. While this drove the shortfall relative to our fourth quarter expectations, we were still able to deliver solid growth in both the quarter and for the full-year.","For 2016, we grew revenue and earnings per share, expanded our operating margins, brought our core inventory back in line, significantly reduced acquisition and integration-related expenses, and generated record levels of cash flow from operations. Our ability to deliver solid results, despite unexpected challenges, highlights the health of our strategies, as well as the power of your multifaceted business model. More importantly, these strategies along with our business model position us to grow revenue, EPS and cash flow from operations once again in 2017, even in the face of a challenging retail environment.","Now, let me walk you through some specifics for the quarter. Sales increased 12% over last year and like many diversified global companies, we had various puts and takes across our multiple business lines. Acquisitions were once again a strong contributor, adding approximately $240 million of revenue in the quarter. We delivered organic growth in several of our businesses including online, Asia, Champion at mass and Licensed Sports Apparel. This growth was partially offset by declines in our basics business, Champion in the sports specialty channel as well as the exit from our catalog business.","Looking at our segments, Innerwear sales decreased 8% versus last year, driven by declines in basics and hosiery, while intimates was flat in the quarter. Despite easy comps, additional shopping days and more seasonal weather, traffic declines at bricks-and-mortar actually accelerated from the prior year during the holiday period and were below even our bearish expectations. This created two headwinds that weighed heavily our basics business and accounted for the vast majority of the miss relative to our guidance.","First, within the mid-tier and department store channels, the lower than expected traffic trends drove reduced point-of-sale, which resulted in fewer reorders. And second in the mass channel, we had a large retailer aggressively manage their total store level inventory by cutting replenishment orders in the key November and December periods, which brought their basics inventory to record low levels. This destocking alone represented roughly 600 basis points of headwind to Innerwear revenue growth in the quarter.","Having said that, our brands remain strong. For the full-year, our basics revenue is essentially flat, which was better than the 2% decline in the overall category, as we gained share through our focus-on-the-core initiative and the launch of our odor control and innovation, FreshIQ. While Innerwear operating margins remained strong at 22.5%, lower volume and the mix impact from lower basics sales resulted in a 200 basis point decline in the quarter versus last year.","Turning to our Activewear segment, revenue increased 3% over last year in the quarter. Total U.S. Champion revenue growth accelerated, driven by the second straight quarter of double-digit growth in the mass channel. Revenue from our Licensed Sports Apparel business increased double-digits in the quarter, driven by our expansion into the high school channel and organic growth in the college bookstore channel.","As expected, our operating margins rebounded from the third quarter as volume and product mix normalized. For the quarter, Activewear operating margins increased 90 basis points over last year to 16.8%.","Switching to our International segment, revenue increased 78% in the quarter as contributions from acquisitions and organic growth in Asia more than offset the decline from our strategic decision to exit certain unprofitable businesses in Europe. The operating margin increased approximately 370 basis points over last year to 14%, driven by our focus on more profitable revenue in synergies from Hanes Europe. In fact, this was Hanes Europe's second straight quarter with double-digit operating margins.","Touching briefly on margins, gross margin in the quarter increased 20 basis points over last year to 39.6%, as the positive mix from International acquisitions more than offset the volume impact from lower sales. Operating margins increased 90 basis points over last year to 15.9%, as the 130 basis point improvement in our core operating margin more than offset the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. The increase in our core operating margin was driven by synergies from prior acquisitions as well as SG&A cost controls.","Interest and other expense increased over last year due to higher debt balances in the quarter, while our tax rate declined as we generated lower profitability in the U.S. These, combined with strong revenue and operating profit growth, drove a 20% increase in earnings per share for the quarter.","Inventory in the quarter, adjusting for recent acquisitions, declined by roughly $132 million from last year, as our actions to reduce inventory delivered their intended results. This, along with the increased profitability over last year, helped drive nearly $400 million in cash from operations in the quarter and brought full year cash flow to over $600 million.","Now let me speak to our guidance, which calls for another year of growth in revenue, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Beginning with revenue, at the midpoint, our guidance range implies 8% growth for the year and includes approximately $410 million from acquisition wraps in the first half. We expect continued strong double-digit growth in our online business as we expand our product offerings across all channels and continue to aggressively shift resources.","And we're being prudent with respect to U.S. bricks-and-mortar, where we expect additional pressure, as retailers continue to prune stores and tighten inventory. Therefore, on a segment level, we expect Innerwear sales to be essentially flat for the year. In Activewear, we expect modest growth as we overlap bankruptcies, continue our momentum in Champion at mass and expand our Licensed Sports Apparel business.","And in our international segment, we expect solid double-digit growth as organic growth on a constant currency basis, combined with acquisition contributions should more than offset FX headwinds. We expect operating profit to be $935 million to $975 million, which includes roughly $25 million from acquisition contributions in the first half.","At the midpoint, it implies roughly 50 basis points of margin decline due to the short-term dilution from lower margin acquisitions. Over the next two years to three years as the synergies from Pacific Brands and Champion Europe begin to flow through, we expect meaningful improvement in our operating margins.","Our EPS guidance of $1.93 to $2.03 represents 7% growth at the midpoint and includes the following assumptions. Interest and other expense is approximately $175 million, a tax rate that is roughly flat versus last year, and approximately $300 million of share repurchases. Finally, we expect cash flow from operations of $625 million to $725 million, with the growth driven mostly by increased profitability and lower cash based acquisition and integration expenses.","So in summary, despite a challenging environment, we delivered solid results for the year and we're extremely well-positioned to grow revenue, earnings per share and cash flow from operations once again in 2017. Our ability to drive consistent strong returns to shareholders irrespective of the end market environment is the direct result of our powerful, multifaceted business model.","Over the past four years, by using all the various levers of our business model, we've added $1.5 billion dollars of revenue, nearly tripled earnings per share, generated roughly $2 billion in cash flow from operations, made approximately $2 billion in acquisitions, paid over $0.5 billion in dividends, and bought back more than $700 million worth of stock.","And it's this powerful business model that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much. So, it looks like it's been challenging to predict what the sales book is going to look like from your key partners. What are you doing to try and improve visibility to avoid the kind of challenges that you've seen in the last 18 months?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi, Christian, this is Gerald. Let me take that question and let me just sort of breakdown 2016 and really address your question that way. We had a strong year overall. If you look at our sales, they were up 5%, EPS was up 11%. And Q4, by most standards, was very strong, revenue up 12% and EPS up 20%. So, we did come in below our expectations in Q4 and really from that standpoint, U.S. traffic was well below even though weak trends that we had anticipated coming off of last year's very warm period. And as those trends held, our retailers took the steps of curtailing their orders to control their inventory.","When they take steps like that mid-quarter, they really can only cut off the replenishment businesses. And so that weighed particularly heavy on our basics business at that point in time. I mean, generally our accounts reduce their orders in line with their traffic in POS, while one large mass retailer took a more aggressive stance in rightsizing their inventory across the store and actually chose to forgo some of their additional holiday builds and let their inventory drop to levels that we typically wouldn't see into mid to late January.","In fact, that destocking alone was 600 basis points of headwind to our Innerwear business in Q4. Now, while the order flow has normalized out of that one account in particular, as we look to 2017 and to address your question on how we're more aware of what's coming to have a better look at it.","We planned cautiously with our bricks-and-mortar accounts, we expect that the environment will remain challenging in the bricks-and-mortar. And early, in the year, we anticipate some more store closings, as well as some inventory pruning. And that's why, as you look at our organic guidance, you'll see in the Innerwear business it is actually flat for the year.","And the guidance, it's actually down in Q1, as we anticipate those store closings affecting that business. But that's really the great thing about our multifaceted business is while we've planned that flat, we've got a lot of other levers to pull in and we're certainly going to continue to drive our online growth very hard.","We're enjoying double-digit growth, both in the U.S. we're also seeing it in our international markets. We hold leading shares and we're going to drive that very hard across the businesses. Our Activewear momentum is building and as we come out of the overhang of the sporting goods bankruptcies, we feel real solid about the organic growth we'll get there.","And then third, we've diversified our business substantially, and our international business now represents 30% of our business and between the organic growth we're seeing in our \u2013 in sections of that business, particularly in Asia, along with our acquisition wrap, we're going to generate a very strong results there as well as continue to harvest synergies.","And then finally, we're going to deliver record cash flow again that gives us confidence that we can continue to drive our capital allocation model and deliver these solid sales and EPS results for our customer. And so we're really planning it cautiously, but having these other leverage to pull irrespective of our end-market environment, makes us feel that we're well positioned to deliver another good year in 2017.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. My question is on the operating cash flow for 2016. You generated $605 million this year. The guidance was for $750 million to $800 million. Can you just talk about where the difference was between those two numbers and how that played out in 4Q?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. We were actually pretty well on plan as we got through the third quarter. So, Jay, it was really the sales miss in the fourth quarter and as a result not getting those collections that caused us to come up short from the \u2013 on the cash flow. That was the key driver.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just to talk about the shift from brick-and-mortar to online, can you give us maybe just a big picture roadmap of how \u2013 at what point the channel shift gets into balance for your business, where you stop seeing big declines in the brick-and-mortar channels and kind of offsetting with \u2013 or almost offsetting with online growth, where both are pretty stable and collectively you can kind of just deliver positive growth in Innerwear consistently going forward?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, Jay, we are in the midst of a transition, it's one that we've talked about for several years is that, that consumer generally is increasingly shifting online. And we've focused heavily, began to focus heavily. Last year our resources shifting both people and our marketing resources and we're seeing a rapid acceleration in our growth. Overall online reached 8% of our U.S. business last year, but it was up to 11% in Q4. And our growth rate actually went from about mid-teens growth rate in Q1 up to a 28% growth rate in Q4 and we saw similar rates to that 28% around our international businesses.","And so, we see it is an opportunity to continue to broaden our assortments and shift our resources across the various online channels. So, we're working with our brick-and-mortar retailers as well as our own sites and certainly our peer players and continue to drive that. And we think that over the next few years, you'll see that go to a mid-teens rate and when you get to that level and you're driving that kind of growth at that rate, it will really help balance out the pressures in the bricks-and-mortar level. And we believe in time, our share can be higher online than it is in bricks-and-mortar market shares.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up really quick one on the Innerwear guidance. Assuming brick-and-mortar down, are you guys assuming it's down next year? And then that's kind of offset by online and Amazon?","And then also on your inventory front, it looks like it's pretty clean, down excluding the acquisitions. Is there anywhere that you guys feel heavy that you're going to still have to clear through? And then I'm assuming that, given the replenishment issues, you're not going to have to take time out of production?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","So, let me talk about the inventory question first. As we came out of the year with a really clean inventory position. I think we're very pleased to be where we were, especially given the softness of the quarter and softness of retail. So, we feel like we're in really good shape on the inventory front.","In terms of the Innerwear business, basically what we're saying is, that in the first quarter we expect Innerwear sales to be down as a result, as that segment of the business continues to digest the announced store closings at retail and this inventory tightening that we've seen taken place. And so, then we should see it normalize, the Innerwear business normalize in Q2. And then, again, for the full year, should be about flat.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. And then just given the lower replenishment for this quarter and I guess maybe first quarter, that's not going to cause any production time taken out either, is it?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, I think our manufacturing group did a great job of balancing the inventories as we came through the end of the year. And we're in good shape to run the supply chain through the year.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, great. Good luck next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Couple quick questions. Rick, your tax rate has come down steadily over the last several years. How low can it go if current tax law doesn't change? And how do you see it? If it is going to go higher, how do you see that playing out over time? And are you more concerned about changes in tax laws pertaining to transfer pricing or the border adjustment tax? And then, I had a follow-up on cash flow. Thank you.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Well, on the tax rate, we're seeing it flat this year. Dave, as you well know, it's a function of what percentage of profitability is coming from where in the system. And so we're looking at some similar dynamics in 2017 as we saw in 2016. So, it was always said that over time we expect the tax rate to go up and as profitability in the U.S. over time continues to improve, and that's obviously in the context of the current tax code. So, that's why we pegged it kind of where it is for this year.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Let me pick up on that, David. Just from the standpoint of \u2013 look, the U.S. Corporate Tax Reform has got many elements that they are being discussed at this time and they're likely to evolve over 2017. And we're engaged in that process, working with our advisors and our industry groups and reps, and we'll stay involved in that throughout.","Specific to your question about border adjustability, there are elements such as border adjustability that are being discussed that would impact imports and they would impact the entire apparel industry as well as U.S. retailers and would ultimately need to be offset by a price increase.","Now, we're advantaged in this situation because we own our own supply chain and there is a substantial amount of U.S. content that's in that supply chain and the production we do within our supply chain, while most of our apparel competitors and our retailers import and it's predominantly imported content.","So, as we begin to look at this, and certainly the proposals are still in development, but as we look at it relative to what it might mean in pricing, it's in no means in any similar size. It's much smaller than the cotton bubble that we worked through that we would be putting in place.","And as we look at it, what we saw during that cotton bubble was that brands in particular perform well in periods of rising prices. So we'll stay involved in it, but we understand the shape of it. And once again, we view that our supply chain advantages us because it allows us flexibility in U.S. content to respond.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I mean, do you see how you saw product, i.e., multiple units in a package, as an advantage in terms of how you respond in that kind of environment? Whether you put five in a pack instead of six or something like that? Is that how you think about the business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, we perceive it more that in a branded business that your brand can carry the required increase to offset any cost increase.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then, if I could follow-up, Rick, on the cash flow from operation. So, basically, what you're saying is the shortfall in sales translated to higher inventory, which translated to the divergence in cash flow from operations versus your projection. Is that pretty much it?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, actually, it affected us more on the accounts receivables side or the flow through accounts receivable. If you think about it, with the churns we have in inventory, once we get into the fourth quarter, the key driver is really collecting sales because the \u2013 we've already, in essence from a cash standpoint, paid for all the expenses associated with those sales. So, with as quickly as our receivables turn, it becomes really very much like a sales driven quarter in terms of cash flow. Does that make sense?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking our question. I guess, I was hoping to follow-up on Innerwear. We weren't clear, but what's driving the recovery in this segment starting the second quarter? Are you guys expecting better replenishment either at mass or at department stores? I think you mentioned in mass the large partner has stabilized now. And how much are the store closures alone expected to impact this category? And then secondly, so inventories look clean, you have easy gross margin compares here in the first half. How should we think about gross margins for the year and any color on the cadence first half versus back half?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me start with the question about the cadence of the Innerwear business. The business does pick up as we overlap some of the store closings and so forth that we do anticipate being the heaviest in the first quarter and then we overlap that as we go forward.","In addition, we will continue to push our innovations, such as FreshIQ, behind the business and, of course, with a double-digit growth rate that we're experiencing online, that also gives us some additional acceleration as we go down through the year.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me kind of walk you through, how we view the year, unfolding from the cadence standpoint, let me do it by business line. We were talked about the Innerwear business from a top-line standpoint being down for the reasons we talked about in Q1, normalizing in Q2 and that would then imply, being a little bit in the back half of the year to come back to flat for the full-year.","With the TSA bankruptcy behind us now we expect the Activewear business to be pretty consistently, modestly up during the course of the year. We see in the DTC business, as you know that has struggled a little bit because of our exit of our catalog business and a couple of other things.","And so, that's going to continue to be a headwind through the first two quarters, so we expect DTC \u2013 pardon me, DTC sales to be down in the first half. But in the second half, you'll see better how our online business is growing.","And so you'll see growth in the second half and should be basically flat for the full-year for DTC. So the growth in the second half offsetting the down in the first half. In our international business, you're going to see growth in the first half from the acquisitions of Pac Brands and Champion Europe.","And then you should in the second half as we wrap those acquisitions in the second half, you should see some organic growth in the international business, that's going to be moderated by we think, by strengthening dollar in the back half of the year.","So, we're thinking about $30 million to $40 million of FX impact mostly in the back half of the year. And so that will take a little bit of a bite out of the organic growth from those businesses. But we still think that will be \u2013 especially how we see the top line flowing out in terms of gross profit, our expectation is that, that it should be up year-over-year. And generally, it should be up each quarter.","Now operating profit, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to be down about 50 basis points. As I said in my prepared remarks, that's going to be a function of the impact of these lower margin acquisitions, primarily in the first half of the year. So about 50 basis points at the midpoint for the full-year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys, afternoon. So, Gerald, can I just ask you quickly? Can you help us with a little more \u2013 related to your comment earlier about M&A and that the first half would be more focused on integration? I'm assuming that what's behind that comment is that that's more the focus than looking for new acquisitions at this time. And maybe just any of your thinking on what you meant by that and how the first half of the year look?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. I'd be happy to do that Michael. First of all, we're going to continue to follow our disciplined approach through returning capital to our shareholders, we had strong cash flow. And over time, that's been a mix through dividends, acquisitions and share purchases. And our focus over time has really been for that to be a balance. And we've increased our dividend, we've got \u2013 by 36%, we've got confidence in our ability to consistently grow EPS and cash flow and we indicated that, certainly with the delivery of that dividend.","We also see our stock is a value at this point in time. And so as we noted, we're planning to buy back stock during the year. And then finally, acquisitions are still a very important part of our strategy going forward. And I want to be clear on that. We did make $1 billion in acquisitions. So in the first part of the year, we've got our hands full finalizing those integration plans.","But at the same time, as we've always said, we're out talking to people, we're assessing opportunities and we'll let you know when the next one is ready to be discussed. But clearly, there will be more acquisitions in the future.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I think, if I could for a minute, I know this has come up a couple times in Q&A. But I think what people are struggling with is the organic guidance here with \u2013 I know you said your number five retailer is a large online play, but I have to guess at least half of your other 10 retailers have some door closures coming this year that they haven't told us about it yet.","And within those, the ones that have spoken, for example, Macy's, obviously a bellwethers, one that is on top of those door closures negative compares. So I'm trying to get more comfortable with how we get to even the low end of your organic growth rate, given what you guys have baked into your forecast for \u2013 we don't have official door closures, we don't have official negative comp guidance from a lot of the channel in the U.S. yet. But I think it's fairly generally accepted that that's the direction we're going to head.","And then you mix that in with a mass retailer that you mentioned in a couple times over the last year we've seen that retailers are perhaps willing to take their days inventory to lower places than they've been historically. Can you help us think about how you thought about that kind of a negative bias to the market as you planned out the year?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me take a crack at it. And again I think it's back to business by business. We've tried to be prudent in our approach to the bricks-and-mortar channel \u2013 various channels in this upcoming year in our guidance. So we do have, I would just remind you that we do have confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong online growth. And so we think that there is an opportunity there for us to offset \u2013 we do understand that there are door closures coming this year and we've tried to factor that into through our thought process on the Innerwear business.","The Activewear business has good momentum right now. It's particularly in the Champion business and in the Licensed Sports Apparel businesses, those businesses are doing really well. And again have some really good momentum and again the TSA bankruptcy is behind us and so we feel really good about that, the ability of that business to continue to drive growth.","And then the international business which is now 30% of our business, we're not only getting the acquisition piece, but with those acquisitions that we made last year are really more growth oriented acquisitions, top line growth oriented acquisitions. We expect to see those businesses give \u2013 those \u2013 that resulted in international having a higher growth rate than our domestic businesses, higher organic growth rate than our domestic businesses.","So, Michael I hope that's helpful to kind of give you a sense of where we think that \u2013 and thus you put all that together we have a \u2013 at the low end of our guidance, we're talking zero organic growth for the top end, we're talking about 2%, actually a little less than 2%. Organic growth, we think that given all those factors that's a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask \u2013 a lot of the shifts and channel disruptions and the store closures and negative traffic and choppy traffic \u2013 as it relates to the categories that are really important to you guys, how do you feel or do you feel consumer behavior is changing in terms of how they buy these categories?","Is there any evidence in terms of the basket sizes people buy in your categories when they're buying online directly from your website? Or what the basket sizes within \u2013 and average price points and types of categories they're buying \u2013 if they're buying from Amazon or in your traditional wholesale channels?","Just trying to understand. It feels like there's something bigger here going on in terms of the shift around the consumer behavior in these categories. And maybe there is some evidence of that in some of those things like basket sizes?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Omar, when we look at sort of the per capita consumption, so far we \u2013 that we tend to look at on our categories. We don't see any indication there that there is a change in consumption from that standpoint. Certainly the disruption of retail stores closing and adjusting inventory changes the cycle of some of those shipments and it's a little harder from quarter-to-quarter, we get some volatility in there. What we've seen actually in some of the online accounts is that we can actually sell larger packages and they'll consume bigger packages in some of our packaged goods than we can sell at retail.","So, we don't have a clear indication that there is a basket size effect. We do see that the holiday periods are sort of changing and focus in the key promotion periods and the consumers are buying closer to that promotion event. If you take a holiday period that we just went through for example, there didn't seem to be nearly that build that you would normally get running up at retail, it \u2013 just sort of flat, right up to the week before Christmas.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then quickly on FreshIQ, it doesn't feel like there may be as much buzz as we had been hoping for. But we don't see the numbers, and you guys have your expectations. Maybe help us understand where that is and what's going right with it and where there's room for improvement around FreshIQ?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Basics revenue was flat for the year, and while the overall basics category was down 2%, and that was really driven \u2013 our strength was driven by our focus-on-the-core initiative, and the key component of that was our FreshIQ innovation that we drove.","Now, you'll probably remember that it was a flow-in. And so there was sort of a mixed inventory out there as we went into the fourth quarter, but we did have a few stores where we actually completely swapped out the inventories as well as a couple of online sites. And there we can make a like-for-like comparison and we see a nice lift from one to the other that shows us that \u2013 what the research told us is what's happening, that consumers prefer it and they buy it.","So, we'll continue to build it. This is one that we expected to build over time. And as you know, we get behind innovation platforms and we drive them for 5 years to 10 years. And this is one we'll be heavily behind as we get into 2017. And a lot of that, as we've quoted in our comments, we'll do in a digital world with our media as we focus more on driving online as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from C.L. King & Associates.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good evening, everyone. Gerald, just reiterating your answer from the first question, you mentioned that the destocking experience in the mass channel in the fourth quarter abated in first quarter and order patterns have normalized. Is that accurate?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes, what we saw is that it normalized with the pace that we had seen in a year prior period, yes.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Follow-up question is why is Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, why are those synergies beginning in 2018? Why not sooner?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, a couple of things. One is that the nature of those two businesses are such that most of the synergies that are coming are on the supply chain side and it'll just take longer to get to. There aren't as many SG&A synergies. So, for example, Hanes Australia, the Pac Brands acquisition, very lean, well-run company where there really isn't much of a need to cut a lot of overhead there. And it's a long way away. It's very difficult to manage it from here. Just as an example.","So there aren't a lot of SG&A \u2013 aren't as many SG&A synergies there as we've seen in other acquisitions. And the cadence of cost sales synergies, supply chain synergies has always been a couple of years after the acquisition. And that's probably going to hold true for both of those acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Nancy Hilliker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. This is Nancy Hilliker on for Ike Boruchow. So, we are wondering, are you able to give us any color in terms of AUC, just based on cotton and oil and labor? Any color you can give us there. And then also, is the focus for this year on building up FreshIQ or is there more innovation in the pipeline for this year?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","First question was cotton, labor (45:23)","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Oh, sorry, I'm sorry that I couldn't hear you. No, on cotton, we are pretty well hedged already for 2017, so we got good visibility there. So, we're sort of in good shape there. Cotton is now less than 6% of our cost to sales. We're seeing the normal types of labor increases around the world. And so we've planned all of that into our guidance. So nothing out of the ordinary though.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","And the follow-up to the last half of your question on FreshIQ is our primary basics focus for the year and we will support that with media as well as promotions throughout the year. And this year, as we've spoke about in our comments, we'll shift more and more of that media to the digital world. What we've seen with consumers is just as they're increasingly buying online, they go online to get their information as well and we want to make sure we're engaging with the consumer where they are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura\/Instinet.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. As e-comm just grows as a percent of the mix, how do you adjust for that typically add-on nature of an in-store purchase?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, what we're doing with the online as well is we are working to identify the ways to drive that same incremental purchase that you get in your peak periods and we do that through several ways.","One is, as I commented earlier, in our large pack programs, we've actually found we can sell even larger packs online. The other is that the consumers do come online more heavily at certain times of the year, such as holiday, and to make sure you're prepared to capture those consumers online just as you would at retail with the appropriate advertisements, as well as offers to make sure that you capture that purchase. Very similar to how we would do it in bricks-and-mortar.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen & Co.","David Buckley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. This is David Buckley on for John Kernan. Thanks for taking our questions. How does the margin profile of your e-commerce business compared to brick-and-mortar? And then, just a follow-up question, with the sporting good bankruptcies behind us moving into 2017, how much operating margin recovery is achievable for Activewear next year? Thank you.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, in terms of margins on e-commerce versus bricks-and-mortar, they are very similar for us, given the way we manage it. So, we see a \u2013 we don't see \u2013 we're pretty indifferent as to where the consumer wants to buy something, whether he want to buy it in the store or online. In terms of the second half of your question...","David Buckley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Operating margin.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","On operating margins in Activewear, we actually saw nice recovery and a normalization of the margin in Activewear in the fourth quarter. And so, I would expect to see, margin expansion in the Activewear business next year as they continue to \u2013 operating profit margin expansion next years they continue to grow that business and leverage their cost base.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, one housekeeping on the pension. What do you expect the pension contribution to be next year?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Carla, we're not required to make any contributions next year, because we're funding status, and we're not planning on making any contributions.","Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then did you give the magnitude of the catalog and other -- the other businesses that you exited for either this quarter or for what it would have been for \u2013 the magnitude for this year?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","You're asking about the \u2013 relatively small direct-to-consumer business, we have. Let me address what we did, and I'll let Rick to comment on the financial impact of that.","From the standpoint of what we've done, it's a relatively small business, and we proactively shifted that business to what we view is a growth strategy, where we're exiting our legacy catalog business and focusing in on our online piece. That catalog business had been declining for some period of time and had really been masking our double-digit growth in our online side and certainly as we focus on online, we want that to be very apparent.","At the same time, we have a group of outlet stores in that business and we have been selling some non-core product there and we exited that non-core product to make room for products we make, particularly Activewear, which had been underrepresented there and given the growth in that category, we think that's very important to pick that up.","So as you can see, we've taken the steps that began last year of winding down the sales impact and that's been a headwind and it'll be a headwind through the first half of this year to focus that business on a growth strategy that will take it to a different level more aligned with where the consumers' trends are moving over time. And so, it'll be our first half headwind to our sales, which will then pick up in the second half of the year.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","In terms of the businesses that we exited, there were really two that, that I would call your attention to, one was, as you'd pointed out the catalog business and some ancillary things in the DTC world, that was about $18 million. And then we did discontinue, we exited some unprofitable businesses in Europe that costs us about $14 million or $15 million in Europe.","Operator","Thank you.

For today\u2019s call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in our businesses, and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thank you, T.C. Q2 was another great quarter for Hanesbrands. We expanded operating margins 210 basis points and grow our earnings 44% to $1.71 per share, providing further evidence that when you combine our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, our self-owned supply chain and strategic acquisitions, we have a great formula for creating shareholder value. The fact that we were able to deliver strong profit growth despite a challenging retail environment also demonstrates that we have the right set of strategies and that we are executing extremely well.","Let me give you my perspective on the overall retail environment. Coming into the year, we expected that consumer spending would remain challenging and that is certainly turning out to be the case. Retailers saw bad winter followed by a tough spring and this only reinforces our view that we need to remain prudent with our sales guidance. But even in spite of our view of the retail environment, we are confident that the benefits of our Innovate-to-Elevate and acquisition strategies can continue. We are reflecting that confidence by raising our full year earnings guidance to $0.40 to a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share. Investors are finally able to see the true earnings power of our business model and we expect DBApparel to add nicely to our current momentum.","Turning briefly to DBA, the more I learn about their business, the more it reinforces my belief that this is a great acquisition for Hanesbrands. We are making good progress towards preparing for closing, which we continue to believe could be as early as the third quarter. We are working through the various deal requirements, including consultation with the European and French Works Councils. We are also organizing ourselves so we are in position to begin to develop our integration plans shortly after our anticipated close.","So, in summary, our business continues to perform extremely well. We have been able to deliver consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past several years by driving our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, leveraging our low-cost global supply chain and effectively deploying our cash flow. Add the Maidenform and DBA synergies to this formula as well as the benefits from deploying future cash flows and we believe we are well-positioned for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","With that, I will turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thanks Rich. We feel really good about the momentum in our business. Innovate-to-Elevate is cascading through the organization. Our supply chain continues to deliver efficiencies and the synergies from Maidenform are beginning to flow through our P&L. This combination delivered strong profit growth as each segment grew operating profit and delivered double-digit operating margins during the quarter.","Let me start with a brief update on Maidenform which continues to perform very well. The brand positioning is resonating with retailers and we are on track to deliver $500 million in sales this year. The vast majority of the integration is complete and we began to recognize some of the SG&A synergies in the quarter. Two weeks ago we reached another milestone when the first Maidenform bra came off the manufacturing line at our facility in Thailand putting us on track to begin to recognize cost of goods synergies in the first half of 2015.","Turning to our segments, Innerwear had a solid quarter given the overall retail environment. Operating margins increased 80 basis points to 23%, a testament to our strong brands and the ongoing success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. Sales for the quarter excluding Maidenform declined roughly 2% from last year as retailers continued to tightly manage their overall inventory levels. We saw this in April and in May when our shipments fell behind point of sale trends, but our shipments recovered in June as retailers prepared for back-to-school. This is the great thing about being in replenishment categories. Over time, our shipments tend to equal our sell-through. Looking at our inventory at retail we believe we are in a great position in terms of weeks of supply heading into the key back-to-school selling season.","Switching to Activewear, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy drove continued improvement in both sales and operating profit. Sales increased 8% driven by strength in Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels as well as solid double-digit growth in both our branded printwear and Gear for Sports businesses. Operating profit increased 23% in the quarter, while operating margins expanded 180 basis points to 14.4%, a second quarter record for the segment.","Turning to international, sales were up 5% over last year. Our operating profit increased 26%, while our operating margin improved 200 basis points to 12.2% as we continue to make solid progress in our regionalization strategy. And lastly I would like to take a moment to comment on our supply chain, which continues to be a strong contributor to our performance and our increased guidance. One of the many benefits of owning our supply chain is that we retain all of the efficiency gains we generate through our continued optimization efforts. We are capturing benefits from a variety of areas including better material usage which means less waste and increased purchasing power with our supplier, higher equipment utilization, and increased labor efficiencies.","So to sum up, we are executing very well and this is evident in our results. Innovate-to-Elevate continues to drive margin improvement and Maidenform is quickly becoming a solid profit contributor, add this to our excitement about DBApparel and it\u2019s easy to see why we are optimistic about our outlook over the next several years.","I will now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Moss","Thanks Gerald. We had another quarter of strong results as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our operating profit increased 27% driven by the same three factors we saw in the first quarter. The first is that Innovate-to-Elevate drove continued margin improvement in our core business with Activewear leading the way. The second was better than expected supply chain efficiencies. And the third was the addition of Maidenform. We are confident that the momentum in our business can continue and we have \u2013 and we reflected that confidence by increasing our full year guidance for operating profit, EPS and cash flow from operations.","For the quarter revenue grew 12% to over $1.3 billion, currency which took roughly 60 basis points of growth of total company sales in the quarter was once again a headwind, but to a smaller degree than we have seen over the past few quarters. On a constant currency basis, core sales were up almost 1% versus the prior year, which is reflective of the current retail environment. Our gross profit margin increased 160 basis points to 37.9% driven by the benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and the outstanding performance of our supply chain.","We continued to lever SG&A in the quarter despite the addition of Maidenform and approximately $2 million in incremental media spend. As a percent of sales, SG&A declined 60 basis points for 20.6%, continuing a trend we have seen over the last several years. Operating profit increased 27% from last year to $231 million, while our operating margin increased 210 basis points to 17.2%. Interest and other expense as well as our tax expense were in line with our previously stated guidance resulting in EPS for the quarter of $1.71, a 34% increase over last year.","Turning to our guidance, let me start by reminding everyone that our guidance does not include any contribution associated with our pending acquisition of DBApparel. Also inherent in our 2014 guidance are the following assumptions. One, we remain prudent in our expectation that the challenging consumer spending environment will persist. Two, cotton costs in the second half will be higher than they were last year. Three, Q2 is expected to be our peak margin quarter as is typically the case. And four, we expect to spend an incremental $5 million to $10 million in media in the second half relative to last year. With that as the backdrop, we have refined our full year sales guidance to approximately $5.75 billion with approximately $500 million coming from Maidenform.","We have increased our operating profit guidance by $45 million to a range of $710 million to $730 million. The midpoint implies an operating profit margin of 14.2% or 130 basis points above last year. We now expect Maidenform\u2019s profit contribution to be approximately $35 million to $40 million. We continue to expect roughly $85 million in interest and other expense and full year tax rate in the low-teens. Given our performance year-to-date as well as our confidence that the momentum in our business can continue, we have raised our EPS guidance $0.40 to a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share. The midpoint represents an EPS increase of roughly 35%, which would come on top of last year\u2019s 49% increase. Finally, we have also increased our cash flow from operations guidance by $25 million to a range of $500 million to $600 million.","So, in closing, we had another strong quarter despite the challenging consumer environment. Innovate-to-Elevate and our supply chain continue to drive margin improvement in our core business and Maidenform is beginning to contribute nicely to profits. And when you add in the remaining synergies from Maidenform, the synergies we expect from DBApparel, the benefits from deploying future cash flows, we believe we are very well-positioned to continue to drive solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the second quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Great execution.","Rich Noll","Thanks a lot, Eric.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","So, Rich, I guess if I could get you to start kind of big picture another quarter here of sort of challenges on the core innerwear business and you are prudently sort of reflecting that in the guide as well. Maybe just talk to what exactly you feel like is going on? First quarter, it seemed like it was sort of weather and calendar shifts, but maybe just speak to what you are seeing on the consumer, particularly in the mass channel?","Rich Noll","Yes. So, let me give you the overview and I will turn it over to Gerald for a little bit more specifics. Coming into the year, we actually said our expectation was that the consumer spending environment would probably be a little bit muted and a little bit choppy. We have seen that last year and expected it to continue and that\u2019s certainly turning out to be the case. At first in Q1, everybody was saying well, it was really cold and it\u2019s weather, but then you came right into Q2 and spring seemed to be relatively lackluster. And you have heard us from a lot of different retailers this isn\u2019t just isolated to any channel. The great thing about our categories though is they are big, they are relatively stable and well, it can put a little bit of pressure on an overall it\u2019s a replenishment business and our sell-throughs tends to match our overall shipments. You did see a little bit of retailers getting somewhat concerned about inventories. And earlier in the year I think you have heard them talk about that. They seem to have replenished that. And I will let Gerald talk a little bit about our sell-through and retail inventory levels.","Gerald Evans","Yes. Eric, picking up on Rich\u2019s comments certainly we did find the retail environment to be very choppy in Q2 just as we had seen in Q1. But while it was choppy, our overall POS trends did improve from Q1 to Q2. And broadly speaking our POS trends were better than our shipment trends in the quarter, which I think really does reflect the careful manner in which our retailers are managing their inventories in this sort of unsettled retail environment. While they did order cautiously early in the quarter, we did see a pickup as we moved towards the back-to-school period which gives us confidence that we are well positioned as we enter that back-to-school period. We know that our share positions are strong and expanding in our key categories. And we are certainly positioned well with a strong array of promotions and so forth going to that long back-to-school period and of course we running a nice load of advertising behind our key platforms as well, so we are optimistic about as we look forward.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And then if I could switch gears on second question, just tremendous execution here on Maidenform and you have got DBApparel in the pipeline here, Rich and\/or Gerald I mean as you think about the potential challenges of integration, one question I get quite a bit from investors is just the potential for capacity constraints, fortunately I have seen the Nanjing facility and sort of feel like there massive ability to scale, but maybe just sort of talk through that, do you feel like there is any capacity constraints on the near-term and how you sort of build out that capacity as you continue to layer in acquisitions?","Rich Noll","So I think it\u2019s important to put the size of these acquisitions in perspective relative to our current global supply chain. As you well know we have recapitalized that supply chain over the last number of years. We feel that it\u2019s running really, really well. And I will say it is a clear contributor over and above Innovate-to-Elevate. The supply chain, the raw efficiencies how well they are executing has really helped us outperform in this first half and is also a contributor to our overall full year raise in our overall guidance. In terms of expanding capacity Maidenform was around 10% of our overall size of our production, you are going to find DBApparel in a similar size, so we are not talking about huge ramp ups in an overall capacity.","In fact on the margin what we are doing is using the supply chain\u2019s efficiency gains and ability to drive more throughput through the same footprint by moving dryers and adding incremental places to eliminate bottlenecks. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we are able to continually drive our cost down as you put more and more volume through it. I think from a capital perspective we have talked about we hit some low marks a couple of years ago right after we had sort of built everything out. We said capital would increase over time from that $50 million, up to the depreciation level around $90 million to $100 million and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s hitting about $70 million or so this year. And that\u2019s more than enough to keep our supply chain competitive, continue to drive cost savings and incrementally add capacity for these types of bolt-on acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Andrew Schmidt - FBR Capital Markets","Hi guys, this is Andrew Schmidt on for Susan. Congrats on a great quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Andrew Schmidt - FBR Capital Markets","On the gross margin, clearly a good job of driving Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, but if you can provide some more color on sort of the MFB margins relative to the core margins. And then also some more color on what drove the MFB guidance increase for the year that would be great?","Rich Noll","Sure. First, how MFB performed in the quarter, we saw MFB perform a little better in a couple of places. Number one was the gross margin on that business was a little higher than we expected at this point. The team has done a great job of focusing that business on profitable core probably a little more quickly than we had expected them to be able to do that. And second was we have been able to achieve the SG&A synergies a little faster than we had expected to get there. So those both drove profitability \u2013 improve profitability for Maidenform versus what we had thought. When you look at those things we expect those trends to generally continue through the balance of the year. And that\u2019s what gave us the confidence to give guidance to a higher profitability level at Maidenform for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Hi, good afternoon, everyone and outstanding quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks Matt.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","So, Rich I was wondering, within Innerwear specifically, I understand the challenging retail environment, but I am really encouraged by the strong growth that you continue to see in your more innovation-related product categories and I was just wondering as we think longer-term, we continue to see strength in innovation type categories and you talk a lot about megatrends, but just what levers do you have at your disposal to maybe accelerate the adoption \u2013 the consumer adoption of these categories versus your maybe more traditional product offerings?","Rich Noll","I think at the end of the day, we are doing all the right things. We got great product. We are generating trial. We will continue, as Gerald said ramping up advertising in the back half of the year to get that message out to a broader set of consumers. And then we find a lot of these innovations when people try them, they substantially convert a large portion of their drawer, if you will to these kind of products. So we feel good about the overall momentum that these products have and that\u2019s across all of the platforms, wouldn\u2019t you say, Gerald?","Gerald Evans","Yes, I would. And what I would add to that is, as we are very disciplined now in treating these as true platforms. Something like ComfortBlend that started as underwear has been pushed very quickly now into women\u2019s and men\u2019s basic such as socks and panties. And in fact in ComfortBlend\u2019s case, we are now pushing it into Activewear T-shirts in which we had a very \u2013 a lot of success this year in the mass channel with that T-shirt as well. So we think there is a lot of legs, X-TEMP is the other one we are pushing out very fast, as well as our flexible fit platform across Intimate Apparel. So there is a great deal of room yet to extend these innovations.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","And then if I may ask a follow-up on Maidenform as well, now that you are starting to layer Maidenform on to your supply chain specifically, if I could ask about the next level of integration with Maidenform Innovate-to-Elevate, can you just update us on how you are thinking about Innovate-to-Elevate specifically with Maidenform and perhaps should we see that coming sooner down the pipeline, as some of these synergies and the acquisition integration has clearly come a little sooner than initially expected?","Gerald Evans","Well, in the case of Maidenform we have always said that the supply chain synergies would begin to come in \u201915 and as you have heard in the comments \u2013 in my comments we have just began to make those bras and bring them into the supply chain. And you will certainly begin to see that, right on schedule in 2015. We have also said it would take a little longer to begin to get our hands around the design element of the line and bring our true Innovate-to-Elevate concepts to it. And now we will begin to comment in the fall of \u201815 line that we are beginning to work on now and we are pretty excited to be able to bring that same discipline that we brought across out other businesses there to that. So we are really right on schedule and you will see really the most benefit out of Innovate-to-Elevate in 2016 which again is right on schedule with what we had said it will be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you and my congrats on the quarter.","Rich Noll","Thank you.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","A couple of questions, one on Champion, if you can give us an update in terms of the traction you are getting there. Obviously, the Outerwear business was one of your stronger segments this quarter and some of the Stay schemes that you might be seeing, given that retailers are kind of in a spring \u201815 decision making mode. And then secondly, how should we expect the core Innerwear trends to be in the second half of this year, you made some positive comments as the quarter was ending heading into back-to-school, can we see that business maybe flattening out versus last year in terms of what\u2019s baked into your outlook? Thank you.","Gerald Evans","Let me start with the comment on the Activewear segment. Activewear segment had a very strong quarter, as you heard in my prepared remarks. Certainly, Champion performed very well, as well as Gear for sports and our printwear businesses as well. For the half, the Champion business is up about 9% and it continues to be driven by strength particularly in the sporting goods channel in the mid-tier and department store channels, both a combination of new distribution, but also expanded distribution in our current accounts. And we remain very bullish on that business and believe it will certainly deliver that 10% growth range for the year that we had spoken about before and that brand is really firing on all cylinders right now, doing very well.","Rich Noll","On the Innerwear side, Gerald, we have seen the trends, let me just go ahead in touch on that David. We saw the \u2013 when we are looking at sell-through at retail across all of our accounts, we actually did see sell-through pick up a little bit better in Q2 than we did from Q1. In this environment, inventory moves by retailers. I think I have said this over the last couple of years, retailers seemed to have their finger on a hair-trigger when it comes to managing their inventories, as they face sort of a tough challenging environment. And what ends up happening even though it may not be impacting our sell-through since we are ordered at once, if they feel inventories are getting a little high, they tend to go to the places they can impact in the shortest term and that tends to be replenishment businesses. Nice thing is they are quick to respond and pull them back up going into a key selling period. So, I think retailers are cautious. They are a little nervous. We do see slightly better trends in Q2 than we saw in Q1 and that\u2019s why we want to be prudent about the rest of the year neither pessimistic nor overly optimistic. And I think we have incorporated that into our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Kevin Heenan - Nomura","Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on the nice quarter. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob. I was hoping that you could maybe offer some more color on Champion kind of from an international perspective in some of the markets outside the U.S., where it\u2019s performing well and maybe some areas where you might be able to generate some more business or enter into going forward? Thanks.","Rich Noll","So, yes, I will take that. Overall, the business that we have with Champion, the lion\u2019s share of it is in the United States. The business for the rights to Champion Europe actually is by a different company that we don\u2019t own. The only pieces that we have internationally are really in the Japanese business, which is a portion of that business. And I think overall the trends there are fairly good and a little bit in Australia.","Kevin Heenan - Nomura","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rich Noll","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Couple of questions for you guys. Just looking at the seasonally adjusted run rate of Maidenform, it seems to be running pretty comfortably ahead of the $500 million annual pace outlined in the guidance. Am I missing something there with the $500 million guidance or is there room for that to go higher?","Rich Noll","No, I think we have always said from a sales perspective, Maidenform\u2019s run rate as we sort of focused their business on their more profitable quarter would be about $500 million. That was actually the guidance that we had coming into the year and it\u2019s the guidance that we still from a sales perspective maintain for the full year. So, I think we are tracking right there. As Rick said earlier, Maiden, we have taken the operating profit guidance from Maidenform, up from originally I think it was $25 million coming into the year to now $35 million to $40 million. And as Rick said, the beat is in a little bit of two places, their gross margin in their core business is a little bit better and we are running a little bit ahead of schedule on realizing some of the SG&A synergies.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","So, does that change your ultimate accretion potential as you think about it for Maidenform, I think it was $0.60 and $65 million of free cash flow or do you think of this as just earlier realization of that potential?","Rich Noll","Yes. So, I \u2013 and I will just turn it to operating profit. So, we talked about $80 million of operating profit by year three. I think we are still on track in terms of the synergies. We might be running a little bit ahead on SG&A that\u2019s not necessarily that will ultimately recognize them higher. And as Gerald said a little bit earlier, we are tracking exactly right to the supply chain savings, so we just started internalizing their production on track of this month. And then you will start to see the Innovate-to-Elevate begin showing up in fall of 2015. So, we feel really good about it and we feel there is a great acquisition. Most of the integration actions are behind us and you will start to see it play out on the P&L over the next couple of quarters and years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs","Nice job guys.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs","Rich, earlier this year, you had spoken about taking some price at retail, I think you quantified it as low to mid single-digits, I am curious to see how you think halfway through the year, the retailers and consumers are responding to that action?","Rich Noll","Yes, that was in selected categories, it wasn\u2019t across the board as remember the world is now in I believe a secular inflationary trend from a wage perspective as the developing world is seeing high single to low double-digit wage increases. And it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to abate anytime soon. And so there is just sort of a general background of sort of a cost push inflation working its way through the apparel chain. And I think that\u2019s going to be a long-term trend. At the end of the day, we had over a decade of deflation and I think that \u2013 those times are now over. We\u2019re talking about very small modest price increase, not across the board and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really impacting the consumer or the retail environment at all, would you say, Gerald?","Gerald Evans","No, I think that they were put in place in February. And in many cases, we saw competitors following, yes, it\u2019s just, really we haven\u2019t seen any major impact one way or the other.","Rich Noll","And then you put that in perspective a couple of percent or few percent on some of the core products, what we\u2019re seeing a lot of traction with those trade-up products that we\u2019ve discussed that are 30% to 50% higher. So, you get the right value equation with the right brand, consumers respond. And I think that was driving our business.","Taposh Bari \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And the other question I had was just on cotton prices rolling over lately. Can you help \u2013 could you just remind us how that flows through to your P&L? I know you said that cotton would be a headwind \u2013 I guess marginal headwind in the back half of the year. But if you could remind us what kind of exposure you have to cotton, and what the timing is like in terms of flow-through.","Rich Noll","Sure. We generally hedge our cotton position out about 6, 9 months ahead of delivery and then we \u2013 and then the cotton goes through \u2013 it takes about six months for the cotton to go through the production process and inventory. So it\u2019s usually around a year or so for it to really take effect so for example, today you\u2019re seeing cotton prices in the upper 60s, you will see those lower price to start to flow through our P&L probably somewhere around the second quarter of next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Burns from D.A. Davidson.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","Good afternoon. Truly impressive margin performance in the first half, so congratulations.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","With the Maidenform and the pending DBApparel acquisition, you will have more than doubled your Intimate Apparel business in just over a year. Can you speak to the long-term benefits of this type of scale, not necessarily from a supply chain side, but from a broader category perspective? Do you think this type of scale changes the competitive environment in any sort of way making it more difficult for smaller brands or brings the potential for greater pricing discipline, just looking for a sort of a big picture view of the category, given your new scale. Thanks.","Rich Noll","Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that first in U.S., and then I\u2019ll talk about in terms of Europe, although, obviously those plans are in as well formulated. In the U.S., I think there is an overabundance of brand fragmentation in the Intimate Apparel segment. This gives us the ability to drive Innovate-to-Elevate through a couple of big, strong key brands, bring innovation that consumers are looking for and if you can come with great brands, with great product, with innovation that consumers are looking for, your business is going to grow. And I think that will be good for us and for our overall retailers. And that\u2019s \u2013 and you can only get that with that kind of scale and scope that we\u2019re talking about in our disciplined Innovate-to-Elevate process. When you look at DBApparel, they\u2019ve got great brands and good shares, strong shares in number one or number two in key categories and key geographies and so it will be opened for the same type of Innovate-to-Elevate discipline to help drive their business and drive their margins in the future. So, we feel really good about our expertise in this category and our ability to continue to drive success growth.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","Thanks and good luck in the second half.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Paul Simenauer - JPMorgan","This is Paul Simenauer on the line for Carla Casella. My questions have all been answered. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Steve Marotta from CLK & Associates.","Steve Marotta - CLK & Associates","Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one tonight. I know that you guys have already commented on cotton as well as labor inflation, but just to put a finer point on it, do you intend to increase unit pricing in the second half and beyond to the same extent that your costing is going up on a linear basis?","Rich Noll","Yes. We don\u2019t look at exactly what our cost is, other than I will say in 2011 when things are going rapidly changing. We generally don\u2019t price on a quarter or a half basis. We look at what we believe is sort of the longer term run rate on cost and price accordingly. So, in terms of the back half, most of the price increases we talked about before, Gerald, weren\u2019t they put in earlier in the year.","Gerald Evans","Yes, we had seen a number of these input costs coming before we ended the year and certainly took that into account to maintain our margins as these costs came through and we put those prices in place in February. And we think we are well positioned.","Steve Marotta - CLK & Associates","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to T.C. Robillard for any closing comments.","T.C. Robillard","We\u2019d like to thank everyone for attending our call today and we look forward to speaking with you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Charlie Stack, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Charlie Stack","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands Quarterly Investor Conference Call and Webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the first quarter of 2013. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the Investors section of our hanesbrands.com website.","I want to remind everyone that we may make forward-looking statements on the call today, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC, such as our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and may be found on our website and in our news releases and other communications. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made.","Please also note, in May 2012, Hanesbrands announced exiting certain international and domestic Imagewear categories that are now classified as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, today's speakers will be discussing our performance from our continuing operations. Additional information, including reconciliation to GAAP performance measures, can be found in today's press release and in the Investors sections of our hanesbrands.com website.","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nictakis, one of our 2 Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is T.C. Robillard, who will be assuming the Vice President of Investor Relations role beginning May 1.","For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes. Bill will provide a sense of what is happening in a few of our businesses, and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results. I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll","Thank you, Charlie. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted 3 aspects of our company that should allow us to drive superior shareholder returns for many years to come. All 3 of these aspects are evident in our first quarter results. Let me recap them for you.","First, we have a strong consumer franchise, a hallmark of any good CPG company and is reflected in the stability of our financial performance even in very volatile times. For us, short-term volatility within a quarter or 2 tends to revert to the mean, delivering the annual consistency more typical of a CPG company. In Q1, while sales were somewhat soft due to macro issues that we discussed at our recent Investor Meeting, due to the consistent replenishment nature of our categories, sell-through at retail has already rebounded and is back on track.","Second, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy allows us to leverage our most precious assets; our strong brands, our approach to consumer-driven innovation and our great global supply chain, all of which combined to allow us to increase operating margins towards our 12% to 14% goal. In Q1, our margins expanded considerably, allowing us to deliver excellent profit results with an operating margin of 9% and record first quarter EPS of $0.51. And we are just beginning. Many of our current new products are just being rolled out nationally this quarter, and with our robust pipeline, we should enjoy the benefits for many years to come.","And third, our strong free cash flow. With a price to free cash flow ratio of approximately 10, our cash flow is substantial relative to our valuation. And that by itself creates many opportunities for materially increasing shareholder returns. This month's initiation of a regularly quarterly dividend is a great example. And as we said, we envision a dividend payout of around 20% to 25% of free cash flow. We're starting at the lower end of the range with the intent to increase our dividend over time. And we are not done. At some point, we plan to also employ bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our strategy to maximize the value of our strong cash flows. As you can see from our first quarter results, our strategies are working, and they give us great confidence in our guidance for 2013.","So that's today's simple message, leveraging our enduring consumer franchise, driving our margin enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and being goods stewards of your cash, which should allow us to drive results for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William J. Nictakis","Thanks, Rich. As we've been doing for some time now, our organization executed really well in the first quarter, and we're pleased that our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working. This strategy is delivering improvement in our profitability while at the same time, driving performance at our retail partners.","But before I talk about the results, let me share our perspective on the macro environment since I know this is top of mind for many of you. For the quarter, there were 2 headwinds that impacted both our business, and from what we hear, the business of many retailers.","First, the delay in the timing of federal income tax refunds, which had a measurable impact in the 3 to 4 weeks from late January until mid-February. And second, the unseasonably cool March, which overlapped last year's unseasonably early warm weather.","When we look at our point-of-sale trends, we estimate the delayed tax refunds dampened sales by about $20 million, while the cooler weather in March impacted sales by another $5 million to $10 million. When we look at our point-of-sale trends over the past 4 weeks including Easter, we see that business is rebounding and is now running ahead of last year. So we believe the short-term impact of the first quarter are now behind us. Remember that consumers tend to purchase the same numbers of pairs of basic apparel over the course of any given year. So eventually, we expect to see the sales come back. When you couple that fact with the shelf space we're gaining this quarter, our increase in media and current retailer inventory positions that are at or below last year's levels, we feel good about delivering our sales guidance for the full year.","Now let me turn to our specific results for Q1, and let's start with Innerwear where we've been executing against our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy for some time. This strategy helped drive significant margin improvement during the quarter as our Innerwear operating profit increased 69%. While Innerwear sales were down 2% for the quarter, men's underwear, socks and bras all grew as hosiery and panties declined. We're seeing great results in our 3 large innovation platforms, TAGLESS, ComfortBlend and Smart Sizes. During Q2, we'll be setting significant incremental space for our ComfortBlend products as this platform continues to exceed both our plans and the productivity goals of our retailers.","We increased our media in Q1, and many of you probably saw our ComfortBlend and TAGLESS ads featuring Michael Jordan that ran during the NCAA basketball tournament. And as a reminder, we still plan to spend an incremental $30 million to $40 million on media this year. And that should only enhance the performance of these platforms.","Our sock category also posted strong results with sales up mid-single digits. As with underwear, the ComfortBlend platform continues to exceed expectations. And our overall Hanes sock innovation strategy that focuses on comfort and color is performing very well. We're using this same approach innovation on our C9 by Champion portfolio of socks, which delivered strong double-digit sales growth during the first quarter.","The bra category was also up mid-single digits, logging the second consecutive quarter of growth. The Smart Size platform continues to resonate with consumers, with sales of Smart Size bras across all of our brands up over 30%. Another highlight was our Bali brand, which posted double-digit growth in the quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with our Innerwear profit results and how our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working to deliver products that delight consumers, grow our retailers categories and improve our margins.","Let me now move to our next segment, Activewear. As a reminder, effective March 1, we renamed our Outerwear segment to Activewear to better reflect how consumers use these products. This segment posted a strong improvement in operating profits in Q1, delivering an 8% operating margin as we recovered from last year's cotton inflation. While sales were down 2% in the quarter, when you exclude the branded printwear decline, the core business was up 4%. In fact, retail sales of Hanes, Champion and Just My Size posted a combined 6% increase in the quarter, led by strong growth in core Champion and Hanes branded products.","Finally, International sales declined 5% but were up 1% on a constant-currency basis. We continued to execute against our regionalization strategy while we're aligning our International businesses into 4 key regions to leverage both our regional expertise and global supply chain. The results are unfolding as we expected.","To wrap up, I'm happy with our profit performance in the first quarter, and we're on track to deliver our sales and profit guidance for the full year. The margin results indicate that our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working as we combine our market-leading brands, consumer-driven innovation and low-cost global supply chain to deliver strong results for both us and our retailers. I'll now turn the call over to Rick Moss to discuss our financial performance.","Richard D. Moss","Thank you, Bill. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I'd like to comment on how pleased we are to return cash to shareholders with the recent initiation of a regular quarterly dividend. The $0.20 per share dividend represents an annualized dividend yield of just under 2% and about 20% of our normalized annual free cash flow of $400 million, a great start.","Now let me talk about our first quarter results. Sales were $945 million, down about 3% versus prior year but roughly flat when you adjust for the planned decline in branded printwear of $15 million and the currency headwind of $7 million. Sales were still below our expectations, however, due to the macro factors Bill mentioned.","Our gross profit margin for the quarter was 34.6%, slightly ahead of our expectations. This 840-basis-point improvement was mainly due to a more stable cotton cost and product pricing environment, and we also benefited from our ongoing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which is designed to increase price per unit and lower cost per unit, particularly on new products.","SG&A was down about $2 million in the quarter versus last year. Media was up approximately $3 million or 50% higher than last year as we continue to restore spending to support our product innovations. Our plan is to spend an additional $30 million to $40 million on media this year, with more than 2\/3 of the increase coming in the back half of the year. I also want to note that about $6 million of the SG&A spending, primarily marketing and selling related, that we had planned for the first quarter will likely now occur in the second quarter. So I encourage you to adjust your models accordingly.","As a result of the improved gross profit margin and lower SG&A spending, operating profit increased by nearly $75 million versus last year, with improvement in 3 of our 4 operating segments. This resulted in an operating profit margin of 9%, a 790-basis-point improvement over last year's first quarter.","Interest expense for the quarter declined $11 million versus prior year. And our tax rate was 13%, including a onetime favorable impact of tax law changes signed into law on January 2 of this year.","EPS for the first quarter came in at $0.51. Even adjusting for about $0.05 of SG&A expense timing, our results were still about $0.05 to $0.06 ahead of our expectations for the quarter, a great result especially in a difficult macro environment.","Moving to the balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital improvement and generating strong cash flow as we move through the rest of the year. Our inventories are in line with our expectations as we begin to build for our key selling periods later this year.","Now let me talk about the progress we're making towards achieving our guidance for 2013. Our sales guidance for the full year is approximately $4.6 billion. We remain confident that our strong consumer franchise and the replenishment nature of our categories will enable us to achieve our guidance. The recent POS data that Bill shared with you seems to bear this out.","We're off to a very good start in reaching our operating profit guidance for the year of $500 million to $550 million. Our strong gross profit margin in the quarter and our continued commitment to cost management put us ahead of plan coming out of the first quarter. And pricing is largely in place, and our input costs are basically set for the balance of the year. As we continue to drive our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, we expect operating margin expansion to move us closer to our 12% to 14% long-term goal.","Interest and other related expense is expected to be $120 million. This includes approximately $15 million in prepayment expense anticipated in the fourth quarter to retire the remaining $250 million of 8% senior notes.","The full year tax rate is expected to be in the teens, with the second and fourth quarter rate at the higher end of the range and the third and fourth quarter rate at the lower end of the range due to the timing of anticipated discrete tax items.","EPS for the full year is expected to range from $3.25 to $3.40, with more pronounced earnings growth from the first half of the year as we overlap cotton inflation from 2012.","Free cash flow is expected to be $350 million to $450 million, including expected pension contributions of approximately $38 million and net capital expenditures of approximately $50 million.","In closing, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Instituting a regular dividend represents another major milestone for us and highlights our commitment to increasing shareholder returns. The combination of our margin enhancing strategy, our execution and our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in achieving the full year guidance we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Charlie.","Charlie Stack","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the first quarter. Now we'll begin taking can your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First, Bill, you mentioned that the current retailer inventory positions are at or below last year, and I was wondering if you could give more color on that. Is that on a dollar basis or a unit basis? And how should we think about replenishment building as we proceed throughout the year?","William J. Nictakis","Yes. I think as we look at our weeks of supply across our categories, across our customer base, we feel really good. We're either parity or actually below where we were last year in terms of average weeks of supply. So we get into the second quarter and again towards back-to-school. We feel really good that inventories are clean and there's not going to be any impediment to the normal shipping flow.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then Rick, you talked about gross margin, and I'm sorry if I actually missed this, but I was wondering if you could break out the gross margin improvement this quarter into the 2 buckets that were provided in terms of how much was that cotton driven and how much of that was driven by the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy.","Richard D. Moss","The Innovate-to-Elevate was about 100 basis points, and the rest was cotton.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, if I could shift gears to International real fast, I see the constant currency sales were down about roughly 1%. I was wondering if perhaps there were anything that you guys could share with us or opportunities that might drive near-term improvement in that business. And perhaps Canada, if you could focus on Canada and the opportunities that you see in that market in the short and near term.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. Short term, the Canada business is real simple. It's Zellers coming out and Target not yet being in there. They just opened their 24th door 3 weeks ago. So that's a big drain. Long term, it bodes real well for us. We have a great business relationship in the U.S. with Target and are already on track to have that same type of relationship on basics, as well as C9 by Champion up in Canada. So long term, it's a real positive for us there. But certainly, it has a big impact in the first quarter, and through the second quarter, that will be a pretty hefty drain.","Richard D. Moss","And Matt, can I just make one correction? On a constant-currency basis, our International sales were actually up 1%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question on just the macro color. Last quarter, you had mentioned that retailers -- or you were seeing a more cautious position out of retailers for the first time in quite some time, the first quarter a little bit weaker than you would hope. Has that changed? Are retailers being a little bit more aggressive now with sell-throughs kind of snapping back into place? Or what are you seeing in terms of the way retailers are acting?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, I think -- this is Rich. Let me sort of put it in sort of a broad perspective. So when retailers were starting to see some of these tactical issues in the first quarter in terms of the declines because of the income tax delays and then weather, to be honest, nobody really overreacted. I think everybody understood that there is these tactical issues out there that will correct themselves. I mean, when you look at the weather, it was crystal clear throughout the country. You could see where there was big swath of bad weather and snowstorms especially on weekends. Comp there was really, really down. In other places where there wasn't bad weather, comp sales were fine. So I don't think anybody really overreacted. It was more like, look, we're having these set of issues. This, too, shall pass. Every single spring eventually comes and it gets warm. So I don't think there was a real overreaction, and therefore, nobody is really saying, \"Okay, great, things are better. Let's go ahead and change our tactics.\" I really think that it sort of was as expected.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then going back to the original comment of sell-throughs returning, I guess 2 parts to that. Did that happen at a point in time in April? And did it happen on a national level? So are you seeing the Northeast revert back to -- the Northeast and the Midwest revert back to more normal sell-through patterns?","William J. Nictakis","Yes. The answer is it really is a switch being flipped. In terms of the income tax refund, you could see exactly when that started. You could see the cooler weather in March. And as the weather is warmed up, you can see a real clear delineation. All of a sudden, the trend line's moving up. So it is night and day. And yes, we see that Midwest and North doing better, snowstorm now. It will have a couple of soft days probably by the -- clearly, it's very clear to see what's going on with that.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then last question I have is the Innerwear business adjusted for the $15 million branded printwear shift. 4% is pretty good, especially considering that, that category or that part of your business is probably more weather sensitive than Innerwear. So can you just talk about that business, the health of that business perhaps in some more color? And have you seen evidence of that category improve as well over the past 4 weeks?","Richard D. Moss","Yes. The answer is yes, we're seeing the exact same weather-related trends happening. Our Innerwear business has spiked over the last 4 weeks and our Activewear business has spiked in the exact same manner. So it is a macro phenomena there. And I think if you look at the solid branded results in the first quarter on Activewear, it's back to our brands resonate. I mean, the Hanes programs are working well, the combination of brand and innovation. And Champion has -- continues to do well across all classes and trade for us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Citi.","Susan K. Anderson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I thought the intimate sales were pretty good. I was wondering if maybe you could give us some color on what's driving that. Is it the Smart Sizes? And do you expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year? Because it seems like other players are kind of struggling in that category. And also maybe if you could just touch on the inventory at the retailers and then to intimate's specifically because I thought I heard that it was starting to build up a little bit.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. If you look at our intimate business, as we said, the bra business is growing nicely. I think that really is innovation driven. Smart Sizes across Hanes, Barely There and Bali is doing exceptionally well for us and really lifting our whole portfolio there. So innovation is working on that. Our panty business was down. That's a lot of promotional overlap more than anything because we didn't overlap some of last year's promotions. We've been growing that business. We feel good about our panty business and innovation we have coming in place that will start showing up Q2 and Q3. And our hosiery business lagged, and it's been lagging as the category declines and we sure are following suit with the overall category softness there. Your second question in terms of inventory levels, it really is going to vary by account when you look at intimates. Overall, again, we're at or below when you look at it on a macro basis. We're in good shape. And of course, some retailers may be heavy some others lighter. But overall, we're in good position.","Susan K. Anderson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good. And then one more question on the Hanes Outerwear. It seemed like that performed really well also in the quarter. Was that driven by space gains? Or are those coming later in the year?","Richard A. Noll","The majority of the growth on Hanes Activewear businesses were just productivity -- new programs that were outperforming prior year's programs. So it really wasn't big space gains in the first quarter. It was just productivity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So I guess, Rich, for you, just first in terms of the top line, again, you went through sort of the macro issues. I know we've got some programs that are coming up, starting here in May and June and selling in terms of Macy's, as well as the men's underwear at Wal-Mart. Can you just maybe remind us again sort of the timing, magnitude of those? And then are there any other sort of -- you're obviously having success with these innovation platforms. Any other type of program wins or shelf space gains that we can be thinking about in the back half?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. Eric, in terms of the program and the space gains, most of those are going to come Q2 as we speak. And the biggest gains are going to be on our basics businesses. So ComfortBlend has delivered extremely strong results across all customers. We're being rewarded and recognized by a significant incremental space on that. That will start setting next month, and it should continue to drive our business. We're seeing the same kind of opportunity on socks. That ComfortBlend socks has done very well. Some of our just basic color innovations have done well, and we're being recognized with incremental space there. Macy's sets in June, and that -- we're just very proud that Macy's wants to put the Hanes brand in their shops, have America's leading brand being -- the opportunity to buy that at Macy's now.","Richard D. Moss","Yes. And Eric, in terms of the additional space gains that we may get later in the year, the fall -- there's the opportunity for a little bit, but really, that's not the big reset time. It's usually in the January through May timeframe, especially a lot of retailers have been moving those later and later. So the opportunity for additional space gains that we don't already have line of sight to, which we do for some of the rest of the year, really comes to 2014. And as these new programs continue to work, Bill, wouldn't you agree that, that opens up more opportunities for further expansions?","William J. Nictakis","Yes. We deliver the kind of productivity we deliver. We get recognized and rewarded with more space, and they make more money with our products.","Richard D. Moss","Absolutely.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Rick, maybe switching gears, I know there was a big move on the Activewear business to continue to enhance and drive profitability there. Maybe give us an update in the quarter. And then maybe the timing of another -- the intention to internalize some of the source product, maybe just the timing and how we should think about the cadence of that improving profitability?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. I'll speak to that and Bill can add in as well. But we're very pleased with the progress that, that group has made. Their goal is to increase their operating profit, margin, double digits. And I think the margin in the first quarter of 8% is a good step in that -- in the right direction there. So it's significantly better than it was last year. I think it's -- owes to 2 things: number one, the switch -- the decline of the -- the shrinking of the branded printwear business; and the fact that, that group is very focused on improving profitability.","William J. Nictakis","And in terms of internalization, I'd say that is a continuous process. It's not an event or an episodic activity here. We are always looking at opportunities to internalize things. And frankly, what we do is we tend to take things and test them. And once they become big and scalable, then we put them into our supply chain and leverage our low cost, leverage our scale.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could, just one more. Rich, for you, kind of strategic question on uses of cash. You've obviously initiated dividend, laid out the potential for acquisitions and a potential buyback. How does the International piece work into that? And I mean, specifically really Asia and leveraging the supply chain that's set up there and being able to sell into the region. I know it's a longer-term sort of -- but maybe just kind of give us an update on thoughts there, what level of investment needs to be made relative to the opportunity? Because it certainly does seem sizable and could be sort of that next layer of organic growth.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. In terms of acquisition strategy -- I think let me start by just putting once again the entire usage of cash strategy in a framework. Obviously, debt paydown is done this year. Dividend is clearly a priority. We started at the lower end of our range. Over time, you will see that increase into the higher end of our range, of that 20% to 25% of free cash flow. After that, share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions. There's no one priority. It's really going to be more opportunistic on exactly what's available at any particular time. Both domestic and international acquisitions within the Americas and Asia would be part of that strategy. And we clearly have had a demonstrated track record where we could make an acquisition to get us -- build a little bit of critical mass internationally and build upon that platform over time. And that strategy has worked in the past. It can work in the future. Great example of that is we're #1 in men's underwear in Brazil. We made a small acquisition there about a decade or so ago, and we've been able to grow the brand that we acquired with that company and also use them as a way to leverage the Hanesbrands into Brazil. Making the acquisition in intimate apparel space in some more countries or further expanding like we've done recently in Australia are all part of that strategy. In terms of priority of international versus domestic, we don't really prioritize one over the other. We look at -- we are actually keeping abreast of everything that's going on in those marketplaces, and we'll take advantage of any new opportunity that comes our way when the time is right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, a question for you with respect to gross margins. We should see some further improvement when cotton costs fall into the P&L. Higher-volume quarters are still ahead. Looking forward, is the gross margin better than 35% achievable this year?","Richard D. Moss","Well, Jim, I really don't want to give guidance per se on gross profit margin. I will say that you are right, that we should continue to see improvement in cotton costs year-over-year as the year progresses, though that gap, year-over-year gap, will narrow as the year goes on. And it will become less of an issue as we get into the back half of the year.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the Innerwear operating margin was certainly a standout in the first quarter. Looking forward, maybe on a full year rate, as you work towards that corporate objective for 12% to 14%, how would we think about the blend of margin by segment?","Richard D. Moss","I think from a longer-term perspective, the Activewear group probably has, relatively speaking, the most opportunity for operating profit margin growth because they have historically been below double digits and can get -- I would believe, can get into double digits. It doesn't mean that the Innerwear group doesn't have opportunities for margin growth as well. It's just a little more pronounced in the Activewear group.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. At the end of the day, when you look -- as you just said Jim, when you look at the operating margins for Innerwear, they're already pretty sizable. Our goal there is to grow units and grow the top line, not trying to further expand margins, make sure we are investing in our brands so that we have a healthy business not only today but next year, the year after and many years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a follow-up, Rick, on the P&L just so that  given that you have quarterly guidance that directionally we're modeling it correctly, those helpful comment on gross margin, it sounds like -- you had said the first half earnings would be up, obviously higher than the second half. Are the second half earnings -- can they be flattish? Or are you assuming they're going to be down? And then as far as sales growth, given the shelf space gains in Q2, should that be the highest growth rate quarter of the year so that we're thinking about the model correctly as the year unfolds?","Richard D. Moss","I just really don't want to get into quarterly guidance like that. I think -- like I said, it's first half of the year, we'll see much greater improvement in terms of year-over-year comparisons than in the back half of the year.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And as far as one of your larger customers was -- Penney's was 100-basis-point headwind or so for you on the top line, they're certainly making noises about focusing on basics, which I'd like to think while may not be material overall, there certainly could be another small tailwind. Is it your sense that you're going to see them more aggressively pursue brands like yours without tending to be more inventory and size intensive and more basic oriented? And are you feeling more optimistic on that front?","Richard A. Noll","So clearly, there's been a big change at Penney's. If you remember, it used to be 2% of our business. It's now a little bit over 1.25% is about -- is what it is. There's no question that as they've now overlapped their promotional changes of last year, we started to see their sell-through go up and down, looking more in line with what the rest of the retail world does. So it's been improving. They've -- since the change at the top, they really haven't communicated exactly what changes in direction that they're going to undertake as a company. The good thing is there's a lot of stability of management, believe it or not, in terms of the head merchant. We know a number of those people, one of the women that runs it. She was a strong player when Mr. Ullman was there before, under there, same thing. She was there under Mr. Johnson and will be going forward as far as we know. So I think there is going to be a lot of stability. They're focusing on national brands. Basics will probably be a part of it. So there could be some upside. Yet at this point, they've got a lot to figure out. We need to wait to hear from them before we make our own conclusions about how it will impact our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Rich, you talked a little bit at the beginning about kind of capital allocation, dividend, M&A, repurchase. And it seemed to me -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, it seemed to me you're emphasizing probably dividend growth from the lower part of that 20 to 25, maybe up towards the higher end over time, then M&A, then share repurchases. Is that the right order of priority? Or am I misinterpreting?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, you're misinterpreting a little bit. I would say there's probably a slight preference on the dividend payout, getting it towards the higher end of the range. Yet from a dollars perspective, that's a relatively small dollar amount. So you don't really need to think of it as eating up a lot of overall free cash flow. In terms of M&A and share repurchases, you shouldn't think about it as a priority, one as a priority over the other. I really think about it as over time, you're going to see us use a mixture of dividends, share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions to maximize value. In any given year, you may favor one over the other just because of the tactical timing of what's going on. But when you look at it over a number of years, you're going to see a mixture of all 3 of those things. So we don't necessarily think of it as it's in this order, A, B and C, rather than as they're all things that we'll employ to create value.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's very helpful. And then you talked a lot about the timing of tax refunds and some of the impacts you saw there. Have you been able to discern from some of the trends and the sell-throughs and switching your replenishment business -- replenishment businesses and there's obviously been -- at the beginning of the year, there was a lot talk about the tax increases that the American consumer was going to be facing for the first time in a long time. Have you seen that at all have an impact or discussions with retailers? Or has it really been more weather and timing of tax refunds?","Richard A. Noll","It's really more of the timing of tax refunds than the weather. The data is crystal clear when we look at it. The tax refunds, when they were delayed a couple of weeks, the sell-through implications on those couple of weeks, I think, Bill, wasn't it down almost double digits for like 2 weeks? And then as soon as the tax refunds started to flow again and matched last year's numbers, you see that, that's correct. And then on weather, you could see it area by area across the country. Whether or not there's a broader macro issue on the payroll tax increase and those things, that data isn't quite that clear yet.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, Rich, I wanted to circle back again to one of your initial comments. You talked about CPG companies and the consistency of those businesses. I think what jumps out probably most substantially in terms of -- and I agree there's a lot of similarities, but maybe some of the differentials there between Hanesbrands at least from a cursory review versus some of the CPG guys, one might be -- the global exposure, and I know that's an area you're focused on, but another is probably the margin level. You look at some of these CPG companies, they've been able to sustain pretty robust margins over very long periods of time. I know your margins are moving in the right direction and keep expanding.","Richard A. Noll","Yes. In terms of the global footprint, clearly, in the Americas and Asia, that's one of our priorities for growth long term. I think from a margin perspective though, if I focus on operating margin, not growth versus SG&A because that's business model dependent. But when you look at operating margins and you look at the operating margins of Innerwear, I think that they -- you could stack those up to virtually any CPG company and feel good about that. Clearly, we've got a little bit of corporate unallocated. That's always going to reduce that a little bit. And Activewear is one of the areas where we've got margin opportunity. So when you look at the categories that are most like CPG companies, measure on an operating margin basis, I think you see even a lot of similarities there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kelly L. Halsor - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","This is Kelly for Scott. Just following up on Jim's question about gross margins, when you look back on a historical basis, gross margins tend to be higher in Q2 than Q1, barring any significant changes in cotton costs. Is there anything that I'm not considering that would make it -- this pattern not being the same in this year?","Richard D. Moss","I think what we've seen historically is that while that's -- what you're saying is true more often than not. It also -- there's also a lot of years where it isn't. Last year, for example, granted there were a lot of cotton movements. Actually 2 years ago, the highest margin of the year was in our first quarter. So it's not universally true. But that's the case.","Kelly L. Halsor - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. But there's nothing that I'm missing here that would be a major impact in how I'm doing that on a sequential basis?","Richard D. Moss","Our history is our history. So no, you're not missing anything.","Kelly L. Halsor - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just my second question is just with general corporate expenses. How should we be viewing that? I know that your media spend is obviously growing, but in terms of any major buckets there that we should be modeling out that I'm not considering?","Richard D. Moss","Well, obviously, from an SG&A standpoint, the biggest mover this year is the increase in media spending, the $30 million to $40 million increase in media spending which will come primarily in the back half of the year, I think some 2\/3 of it in the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Marotta with KL (sic) [CL] King and Associates.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you speak to the proportion of revenue dedicated to pre-books versus replenishment in the first quarter and the second quarter?","Richard D. Moss","Well, we're -- I could tell you broad we're not going to get into it on a quarterly basis. But if you look at our Innerwear business, it is replenishment other than a promotional order, which we booked -- we have back-to-school and holiday. The rest of that is just replenishment, and about 70% of our Activewear business is pre-book.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And as it relates -- just more or less a reiteration. As it relates to the $15 million prepayment, can we think of interest expense as within that $25 million to $27 million in each quarter? Or was that incremental $15 million in the fourth quarter bucket?","Richard D. Moss","The incremental $15 million is in the fourth quarter bucket. The rest of it should be fairly even through the year.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And that equates to roughly $0.12 a share, which is included in your current EPS guidance range, correct?","Richard D. Moss","That is correct, Steve.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Though it is a onetime item?","Richard D. Moss","It is a onetime item that we are including in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Burns with D.A. Davidson.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on the C9 program. It was low single digits in the quarter likely impacted by external factors. Could you talk about the growth opportunity going forward? And is it primarily a function of improving sell-through at this point? Or are there some categories you see for that C9 program that it could extend into to accelerate the growth?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. I think there is 3 ways we're going to continue partner with Target to grow C9. You have their Internet opportunity where we're working with them. You have Canada. And then you have continuing to drive within North America stores. And as we look at North America, there's opportunities both to improve productivity of the existing programs, and then we'll work with as other categories that are brand right for C9 and where their own brands maybe aren't delivering the kind of productivity that they'd expect to have or would like to see. So there's a lot of opportunity for us across multiple geographies, channels and categories still with C9.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And at the Analyst Day, we heard about the X-TEMP product getting into stores, getting to Kohl's. it seems to really have grabbed some great shelf space. Can you talk about the success of that product and really the climate control product category, ability to expand that beyond Kohl's?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. We've been in at Kohl's for a couple of months. They are very pleased with the results. We're pleased with the results. They're ahead of plan. We haven't set the product in any other account yet. It will start getting set in another 6 to 8 weeks. We did a promotion with one account. So it's way too early to make a call, but all signs are positive for X-TEMP. And we think it's just another example of us being able to Innovate-to-Elevate in terms of it's a higher ring for our customers, they make more money and we do as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Beder with Brean Capital.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","When you look at this innovation, this very aggressive rollout of innovation product, what kind of is the shelf life of these products in terms of how long you before you have to, I guess, come up with the next innovation? I know [indiscernible] pretty much throughout the entire chain. You've got the offerings eventually. But kind of how do you look at the rollout and the shelf life of these products?","Richard A. Noll","You really need to step back and think about our categories as really what we're really doing is driving innovation in the core. And while some of these products will start out relatively small, our goal is to actually build them into a substantial portion of the overall market. I think of TAGLESS as an innovation, right? That wasn't some niche product that had a short shelf life that then had to be replaced. Basically, it's over the last 10 years we've been able to drive that from T-shirts to bottoms to panties to a whole host of product categories. And it's become the new innovative core. ComfortBlend may be another product that becomes -- that's similar. I think over the next 5 or 10 years, you're going to see that kind of performance-oriented fabric be in a much larger portion of the core market. So you shouldn't think about these as niche products that have to come in and out. It's really about driving innovation with consumers for the products that they want to solve their needs that are going to have a lot of staying power.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.","William M. Reuter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but in terms of the decrease in inventory, did you break out what was price versus units?","Richard D. Moss","No, we didn't do that, but I can give it to you now. The -- versus first quarter and last year, inventory is down $272 million. $81 million is due to lower units, $121 million due to lower input cost and $70 million is the discontinued operations.","William M. Reuter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then only other one for me. You mentioned bolt-on acquisitions. Last quarter, you guys had said you were targeting leverage of 1.5 to 2.5. I mean, are there any companies that will be larger that would be on a kind of wish list basis that if you guys -- if they became up for sale, that you wouldn't be interested in that are much larger than bolt-ons?","William J. Nictakis","We've talked about what our acquisition criteria is. What we're really trying to communicate is we have strong free cash flows and we want to deploy those free cash flows to maximize value. So when you think of acquisitions, think of it in the context of how to maximize the value you get out of free cash flow. Don't think of it as an acquisition strategy by itself.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.","Paul Simenauer","This is Paul Simenauer on for Carla Casella. Just one quick question. Did you guys say what percent of your sales growth target is from space gains?","Richard A. Noll","Can you repeat the question? You cut out.","Paul Simenauer","Did you guys say what percent of your sales growth target is from space gains? I may have missed that.","Richard D.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce our first speaker for today, Mr. T.C. Robillard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","T.C. Robillard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the HanesBrands Quarterly Investor Conference Call and Webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the third quarter of 2013. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.

Additional information, including a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP, can be found in today's press release, which is available on the Investors section of our hanes.com website.","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer; Gerald Evans, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in our businesses and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll","Thank you, T.C. Let me start by saying we had another great quarter. We saw margins expand 200 basis points. We achieved record earnings for the second quarter in a row, and we gained share during the back-to-school selling period. Our strong performance is driven by our ability to execute on the things we can control, as well as the success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which is delivering results better and faster than we anticipated.","Even though we gained share, the overall retail environment during back-to-school was weak, ultimately impacting our Q3 sales. This retail weakness is causing many retailers to feel cautious about the upcoming holiday season. Therefore, we are going to be prudent and take a very conservative sales view in the fourth quarter. But even in spite of this prudent macro view, we are raising our operating profit and earnings guidance for the second consecutive quarter based on the improved profitability and the continued momentum in our business.","The success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy gives us the confidence to take the high end of our EPS range up by $0.20, with about half of the increase coming from an improved profit outlook in the fourth quarter.","When you add Maidenform to this momentum, we feel very good about the remainder of 2013 and for 2014. In fact, we are also increasing 2014's target EPS range to $4.25 to $4.50.","I'm going to focus the remainder of my comments on the Maidenform acquisition, and let Gerald and Rick talk about the near-term performance of our business. We closed the acquisition on October 7 and, just as we expected, their business continued to deteriorate all year long with a current projection for this year's revenue of approximately $550 million and operating profit in the low $30 million range, which is very much in line with our assumptions and was already incorporated into the guidance we gave you last July.","But don't focus on these current trends, it's what we can do with the business that counts. And the closer I get to their business, the more confident I feel about achieving our long-term profit goal. We knew exactly what needs to be done to cut costs and to drive profitable sales.","We made tremendous progress on the integration in the 90 days since signing the deal and in the past 3 weeks since closing. By the end of the first week, we were already selling Maidenform's products on our e-commerce sites and in over 100 of our own outlet stores. By the second week, we finalized the vast majority of the organizational decisions and communicated them to all of the Maidenform employees. The simplest way to conceptualize this integration is that we bought the brand and the business, but we're going to close the company. We will keep the things they do well, particularly intimate sales, design and merchandising, but we will rationalize where we have a competitive advantage. Therefore, the majority of the synergies will come from the elimination of their corporate overhead and the absorption of their distribution supply chain functions into our existing low-cost global network.","We have tremendous experience managing large-scale cost reduction and supply chain integration projects, experience that we developed during the many transformation projects we have undertaken over the past few years. We are leveraging these capabilities to complete this integration quickly, with much of it being done by mid-2014 and all of it being complete by the end of 2014, at which time both their headquarters and their distribution center will both be closed.","Looking to the front end, we heard directly from our retail partners that they're overwhelmingly supportive of this acquisition. To that point, within 10 days of closing, we completed combining our respective sales organization, communicating to each individual internally and, as importantly, communicating it to our retail partners. This fast combination ensures that everyone is settled, allowing both our sales teams and our retail partners to focus on driving this new combined business.","As we have continued to investigate the brand positioning, Maidenform's brands remain highly complementary, fitting right in the heart of our contemporary younger brands. They also form a nice balance against our classic brands of Bali and Playtex. Looking at the overall Intimates business, we now have a stronger #2 position in bras and a #1 position in shapewear.","Most importantly, we are beginning to see the opportunities to drive our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy through the entire Maidenform portfolio. The major driving themes would be focusing their innovation on fewer, but bigger platform initiatives, beginning to advertise these platforms to build brand power and, lastly, as these platforms gain scale, internalizing them into our supply chain to substantially improve margins. This strategy is working well for us. It will work equally well for Maidenform.","As you can see, our integration plans are in place. We're developing great ideas, and we're executing aggressively. We remain very confident that Maidenform can add $0.60 a share to our earnings within 3 years. And in terms of seeing the benefit on the P&L, we should first see the corporate SG&A savings beginning in mid-2014, the supply chain and distribution savings in 2015 and 2016 and the complementary revenue growth from Innovate-to-Elevate in late 2015 and fully in 2016.","So to wrap up, our business performed extremely well in the quarter in spite of a challenging retail environment during back-to-school. But even with being prudently cautious with our sales outlook for the upcoming holiday season, the momentum from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy gives us confidence to once again raise our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and for 2014. Add Maidenform on top of the strength in our core business, and we feel optimistic about the remainder of this year and throughout 2014.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich. As we have done all year, we are successfully executing our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy by controlling the things we can control and by making the necessary investments to keep our brands strong for the future, and this is showing through in our performance. In the quarter, we gained share during back-to-school. We expanded our margins with all 4 segments reaching double-digit levels, and we raised our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is not just about new platforms, it is about leveraging our strong brands, our global supply chain and our innovation platforms to drive margins across our entire product portfolio. Having strong brands allows us to gain share even in a tough environment.","The supply chain allows us to leverage our scale to lower cost and improve margins, like what you were seeing in Activewear. And of course, leveraging our innovation platforms has led to some great results for both us and our retail partners.","X-TEMP underwear and socks, for example, exceeded plan at both mass and mid-tier, while Smart Size's bras continued their strong performance, with sales at retail up double digits through the third quarter.","Next, I'd like to provide some color on our revenue trends. As you have heard, retailers saw negative sell-through in August during the key back-to-school selling period. Our point of sale saw a similar trend before rebounding in September. Unfortunately, the rebound was not enough to offset the critical month of August and resulted in a sales decline of roughly 70 basis points on a constant currency basis.","We are encouraged to see that September's positive point of sales trends continued through October, and that our inventory at retail in terms of weeks of supply is in line with last year's level.","Listening to retailers, back-to-school is clearly making them cautious about the upcoming holiday season. Couple this with the fact that retailers are much quicker to adjust the inventories since the recession, and we believe it makes sense to be prudent with our own sales expectations for the fourth quarter. Therefore, the midpoint of our guidance assumes flat sales for the fourth quarter.","However, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is clearly continuing to work and is increasing our operating margin and is one of the major factors for raising our guidance in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our segments. I'd like to start with Innerwear, where our operating margins improved over the prior year driven by a strong profit improvement in our Basics group. Men's underwear and socks were the key drivers with double-digit operating profit growth.","For Intimates, we continued to see strength in our Classic Bra business, with sales up double digits, driven by Bali, Playtex and Just My Size. Our Bali brand was up double digits in both bras and panties, while our Hanes bras grew low single digits in the quarter.","At the beginning of the year, we communicated our plan to invest to incremental media to support our brands. Year-to-date, we have spent $16 million of this amount, with $8 million coming in the third quarter to support campaigns for Hanes underwear and panties, as well as Playtex bras. In the fourth quarter, we plan to invest an incremental $18 million on media.","Now turning to Activewear, our quality of revenue continues to improve, and that drove another quarter of significant margin improvement. Our operating margins increased 500 basis points over last year to 16.9%, bringing its year-to-date operating margin to over 13%. The strong results in the quarter were driven by profit improvement in our retail Activewear group, which includes Champion and Hanes, as well as the deemphasis of the less profitable elements of our Branded Printwear business.","Gear For Sports also had a good quarter with sales up low single digits and operating profit up double digits.","Now switching to International. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 10% and operating margin was over 12% as we continue to make progress on our regionalization strategy. Currency, however, remains a strong headwind. Currency took 10 points of growth off of the segment and a full percentage point of growth off total company sales for the third quarter. We expect a similar impact in the fourth quarter.","So to wrap up, I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, our momentum for the fourth quarter and our opportunities for 2014. Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continues to work well, and you are clearly seeing the benefits in our bottom line results. We feel very good about 2014, including our brand power and continued ability to take price to offset inflation, the continued momentum of our successful innovation platforms and the savings we can achieve through our global supply chain.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss","Thanks, Gerald. Our strong third quarter results were driven by a familiar theme, the success of Innovate-to-Elevate and our ability to execute our plans. Earnings per share of $1.23 was a new record, while our 14.8% operating margin and $230 million of free cash flow were both at near-record levels. With cotton volatility behind us, you're seeing a higher level of base earnings in our business that's being driven by higher quality revenue and our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy.","Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, down 1.8% versus the prior year. Adjusting for currency headwinds of approximately $13 million, sales were down 70 basis points.","Operating profit increased 13% from last year to $177 million, driven by a 240-basis-point improvement in our gross margin, with the majority coming from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which drove a higher price per unit and a lower cost per unit in both our Innerwear and our Activewear segments. We continued to deliver SG&A leverage in the quarter, as SG&A in dollar terms was essentially flat from last year, despite an incremental $8 million in planned media spend.","Interest expense in the quarter declined roughly $8 million due to lower debt balances and a lower average interest rate.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continued to drive improvements in our inventory turns. During the quarter, our inventory decreased by $27 million from last year, with the majority of the decline coming from lower units.","I'd now like to spend some time on our updated guidance for 2013. The momentum from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is driving a better profitability outlook for the fourth quarter and gives us confidence to raise our operating profit and earnings guidance once again. We now expect our 2013 full year sales to be slightly more than $4.6 billion, including about $120 million in the fourth quarter from Maidenform.","Operating profit is now expected to be $580 million to $590 million, up from our prior range of $550 million to $575 million and includes $6 million to $8 million from Maidenform and the planned increase in media spend that Gerald mentioned.","Interest and other related expense is expected to be $118 million, which includes $15 million in prepayment expense to retire the remaining $250 million of 8% senior notes and $3 million for the amount borrowed on our revolver for the purchase of Maidenform.","We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 17%, which implies a rate in the low double digits for the fourth quarter.","We raised our EPS range to $3.75 to $3.85 from our previous range of $3.50 to $3.65. Of the $0.20 to $0.25 increase, about $0.10 is from the upside in the third quarter, about $0.02 to $0.03 is from Maidenform, with the remainder coming from an improved outlook for the fourth quarter.","Next, I'd like to touch on the acquisition and integration expenses related to Maidenform, which were excluded from the guidance I just provided. By the end of 2014, we expect total acquisition-related expenses of $120 million to $140 million, with $50 million to $60 million expected this year and the remainder spread through 2014. Of the total acquisition-related expenses, we estimate that approximately half will be noncash.","Turning to our cash flow guidance. We narrowed our guidance range to $475 million to $525 million, but we retained the same midpoint of guidance, despite $30 million to $40 million in acquisition-related cash expenses that were not in our original plan. Our free cash flow guidance continues to include approximately $38 million in pension contributions and approximately $50 million in net capital expenditures.","With respect to debt, adjusting for the pay-down of the $250 million and 8% senior notes and the increased borrowings on our revolver from the acquisition of Maidenform, we should end the year with long-term debt of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This implies a long-term debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.1x, well within our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x.","In closing, we're thrilled that our year-to-date operating margin is just over 13%, right at the midpoint of our margin goal. This is a testament to our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and our ability to execute on the things we can control. And it feels great to be able to raise our guidance for the second time this year. You're now seeing what we believe is a sustainably higher level of earnings for our business. And with the addition of Maidenform and the continued reinvestment of our significant levels of free cash flow, we believe that we are very well positioned to deliver growth for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the third quarter. We will now begin taking your questions, and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions]","I would now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question is on the guidance for 2014, the $4.25 to $4.50, the update, the increase there, how much of that -- can you just actually help us understand where the increased expectations are? Is that from the revenue, the top line? Is that from operating margin? And if it's from operating margin, can you help us localize what the vision is for Activewear, Innerwear, et cetera, where you have a better outlook?","Richard A. Noll","So let me just give you the broader overview because it's a little too early to get into some of that level of detail. But we're feeling really great about our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. It's working. It's driving our results. You've been seeing it all year. You saw it last quarter. You're seeing it in results this quarter, and it's what's encouraging us to raise our full year guidance with an improved profit outlook for Q4. And that momentum in our current business is going to continue into 2014. And so we felt that it was important to call that momentum out in our business and make sure that you understand that it's sort of elevating our target EPS ranges for next year. In terms of the overall specifics, how much is coming from operating margin and sales and Maidenform and this, that and the other thing, we're right in the midst of our detailed planning process, so we don't have those kind of answers for you yet. But I think what's safe to say is our strategies are working. It's driving our near-term business, and we see that cascading into 2014 and beyond.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And if I could follow up on that. Activewear this quarter, you called out that it was a record level. In fact, it was an outstanding record level. It seems to be 300 basis points -- the operating margin 300 basis points better than any operating margin as a public company, as you are a public company. Can you talk about what's driving the improvement there? Have you -- is that the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy in its infancy, too, now as you start translating that strategy over to Activewear? And then now that it's at this level, which you could consider to be a best improvement level across all of Activewear companies, how should we think about that structurally being able to stay in the high-teens?","Richard A. Noll","Let me just give the broader overview. I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk about some of those specifics. And look, we are thrilled with the progress that Activewear is making in terms of hitting the double-digit operating margin. You've always heard me talk about be cautious about 1 quarter. And whether it's good or bad news, it's -- I think the trend is the right direction when you look at the overall increases. Year-to-date, they're doing extremely well, and we expect those kind of trends to continue. And Gerald, you can talk a little bit about the specifics of what's driving Activewear.","Gerald W. Evans","Matt, it's just a great example of Innovate-to-Elevate at work. We've focused on the core Activewear business and our strong brands in both Champion and Hanes, paired it up with great innovation in the product line and so forth, and it's driving much better margin within the segment. In addition, as we've continued to deemphasize the unprofitable commodity segments of the Imagewear business, we've refocused that business back on a more profitable mix of business. And it's performing very well and the category, as you know, that's a very successful and fast-growing category right now. So we're pleased.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So Rich, I guess maybe if we can start off maybe just talking about the tough retail environment. What you're seeing as it relates to sort of pricing. This Innovate-to-Elevate, you're clearly able to get the pricing, yet it appears it's just a traffic issue. Kind of with the things that are in your control, be it trade spends, you're obviously increasing marketing to $18 million here in 4Q. But what are sort of in your control to try to continue to drive share gains? And is it just simply a macro traffic issue?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, let me give you a little bit more color on sort of the macro environment, and I'll turn it over then to Gerald to talk a little bit about some of the tactics in pricing and the advertising spend. When you look back at the third quarter, our sales were down 1.8%. 1.1 points of that was actually currency, which has been a big headwind for us all year. But the core business was down 70 basis points. However, in our Innerwear categories, we gained share during back-to-school. So it is indicative of the macro trend. August is the second biggest month behind December, and all retailers talked about how it was a soft back-to-school. And we saw the same types of results, so a slightly negative sell-through because of it. Now fortunately, September and October has actually been coming back fairly nicely, but they're smaller months. So you can't make up the gap with -- when the peak is a little bit soft and the trough is strong, you'd rather look the other way. So as we looked into the fourth quarter, we said, \"All right. Well, which do you want to use for the trend? Do you want to use the near-term stronger trend, or do you want to be a little bit more conservative given what happened to back-to-school?\" And given the strength of our margins and how well Innovate-to-Elevate is doing, we thought it would be more prudent to be a little bit more conservative and even with that taking up our guidance because of how well Innovate-to-Elevate is working. Gerald, do you want to talk about some of the specifics?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes. As we looked at the fourth quarter, clearly, we entered the fourth quarter with retail inventories in line. And from the standpoint of executing our plan, we're absolutely executing our plan. We've got an excellent promotion plan in place for the holiday period, and we're investing more behind our brands, certainly, by far, $18 million more than we did the prior year, heavily behind our -- both our Hanes and men's and women's programs to keep driving our brands, our innovations at work. And we want to keep driving what we know that works, and that's our brands and our innovation.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then I guess, so I could switch gears, Rich, to the Maidenform. Appreciate all the color in terms of sort of timing and cadence of how this should play out, maybe just a bit more. You spoke to trying to overlay the Innovate-to-Elevate on Maidenform, maybe rationalizing some of the SKUs and focusing on sort of bigger key platforms, maybe touch on what those are, sort of the timing of how that plays out. And then again, maybe a little bit more just in terms of the cost savings. It seems to me the opportunity would be a little bit sooner than sort of back half '14 as with the in-sourcing of some of the production in '15, but maybe just sort of walk us through those elements.","Richard A. Noll","Sure. We've talked about over the years, we've got a lot of demonstrated competence in managing large transformation integration projects. We did it here when we spun off, bringing 8 divisions into 1 operating company and moving our supply chain around the world. We've been successful with Gear, and now we're applying those same skills to Maidenform. And one of the best way is to try and mitigate any risk with integration, is do it fast as you can in a very methodical -- from a very methodical process, and that's what our focus is. And that's why we came out of the blocks running and make sure that we are communicating to people up at Maidenform on what was going to happen over the -- and the timeframe that's going to happen. In terms of sort of the speed, while we want to do it fast, I really want you to think about 3 separate components because the time frames are different for each one. And SG&A savings will start to show up by mid-'14. We've actually communicated that a lot of the duplicative corporate functions, we intend to close and exit those by mid '14 out of New Jersey and absorb them in here. And you'll start to see the benefits on the P&L after that. While the supply chain, it sounds as easy as that, it's really not. You've got to wrap up some production. You've got to remember, they've got POS that are out there for 4 to 6 months. So you really won't start to see that internalization happen until late '14, and it doesn't really start to show up on your P&L until '15 and '16. And the longest lead time, unfortunately, is the driving the Innovate-to-Elevate, the product development cycles, the shelf space that's already sold then has about 1 year, 1.5 year lead time. And so it will really be a '15 to '16 perspective from that. So don't take this as we're being slow, it's just we're being realistic that you can do cost reduction in SG&A fast; supply chain, medium; and some of the Innovate-to-Elevate a little bit more slowly. That said, you know we love to have a plan and beat the speed of that plan. And so we want to get to that $0.60 as soon as we can. And right now, we think 3 years makes a lot of sense.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the -- just wanted to touch quickly on the top line again. The skeptic might say you guys are kind of going through this premiumization process. It's working. Consumers are responding to the products. But given the macro environment or for whatever other reason, it's having an impact on the volumes. Are you -- how do you identify kind of the sales drivers here? What's macro? What's the retailer ordering last in managing their inventories? How much of it is that versus maybe there's some price sensitivity for some of the consumers in those channels?","Richard A. Noll","When -- I think there's 2 pieces of the data that you want to look at to try and figure out is this -- is it systemic and macro or is it specific to us, and one is share any other -- is our retail -- what are the retailers' experience. And I think all of the data suggests that it was a tough back-to-school. I haven't heard 1 retailer say that it wasn't, and they're all talking about traffic issues. And there is no ifs, ands or buts about it. And so at the end of the day, that's going to impact you in the short term. We feel really good about our overall share position, but these things ebb and flow. I think -- you talk about the skeptics. Let me slip to the optimists. Think about the operating margin and the profit that we're driving in this sort of lackluster macro environment, things always come back. We're going to have a lot of opportunity as that tail -- that headwind goes to a tailwind, continue to drive this into the future.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, Rich. And then just switching to the Maidenform again. You talked about applying the same sort of premiumization, Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to their brands. Can you talk about, based on the work that you've done and analysis you did leading up to the deal and since the deal, that gives you comfort that those brands have that kind of power behind them, and they have the ability to kind of reach up a little bit and insert some more innovation into their products? And how do you see the consumer respond?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, Omar. This is Gerald. Certainly, we feel even better as we've gotten into the business and look at the brand and so forth. We see the -- how the Maidenform brand really complements where we're weaker and so we have a very strong classic position with our brands, Bali and Playtex and so forth in the Bra business. The Maidenform brand is younger. It's more -- a little more contemporary that really gives us a better portfolio to work with. We see our innovations working very well, and we're very excited about applying those across this additional brand group and levering our strengths and then investing in those innovations to drive the brand, ultimately driving the scale and levering our global supply chain to have the full effect of the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. So we're really excited about what we can do with this going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just looking at the EBIT margins. You're already running about 13% year-to-date. So barring any catastrophes in fourth quarter, it seems like you're going to be getting to the high end of your 12% to 14% goal. So just curious, does this push the goal up after this year, or how are you guys thinking about that?","Richard A. Noll","I think our operating margins today are a testament to how well Innovate-to-Elevate is working. It's working better and faster than we expected. We've had that 12% to 14% operating margin goal out there for a little while, and we've gotten there sooner than we had hoped, and that's great. And I think that we're now in there on a sustainable basis. In terms of how high up is up, let's get through this year. Let's do it 1 year fully. Let's get into next year. And as we start to bring in Maidenform and start to see those things, we can talk about where else we can go. But I am thrilled, and I want to celebrate the fact that we've gotten here as quickly as we did.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Great. Yes, I agree. Good job. And then on the gross margin front, I think you said 1\/2 was driven by Innovate-to-Elevate, so maybe if you could just touch on what the other 1\/2 was driven by. And then last question, just on replenishments, I think you said they were shut off in the third quarter. Are you guys still seeing that or expecting that for the fourth quarter?","Richard D. Moss","Yes, Susan. This is Rick. Let me address the gross margin question for you. I think the best way to think about it is to actually go back to the pre-cotton bubble, where for several years we averaged at about 33.6% gross profit margins. And that was in an environment with cotton prices generally averaging about $0.55 to $0.65 a pound. Then you fast-forward to post-cotton bubble, really beginning the fourth quarter of last year when our P&L really started to normalize from that. You've been seeing gross profit margins slightly above 35% on average, and that in an environment where you had cotton prices averaging about $0.80 to $0.90 a pound. So the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy has really been driving pretty consistently about 150 basis points of improvement in our gross profit margin, which we believe is sustainable and is a great base for us to build on going forward.","Gerald W. Evans","And as far as the -- your question about inventories at retail. Going through the quarter, what we've really noticed is, and frankly, since the recession, is retailers can react now, and they react very quickly when they see a downturn in their POS sales to adjust their inventories. And they did that in the quarter. So when they saw the softness in that August period, they adjusted within the quarter. And so we came out of the quarter with inventories in line with prior year, which makes us feel like we're well positioned going into the fourth quarter to satisfy demand. And orders are flowing as we see sales.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a few questions on the incremental media spend. Firstly, in the third quarter, I don't know if you quantified how much the incremental was year-over-year, but it looks like, excluding whatever that amount would be, your SG&A would have been down in dollars, if I'm looking at this correctly. So could you talk about maybe the kind of drivers of the disciplined SG&A in the quarter? And then secondly, looking at the fourth quarter now, the media spend. As we're modeling, where should we see -- which segments should we see more of the pressure from the incremental media? Is it more Innerwear or Activewear? And lastly, when do you -- when should we expect to see maybe the benefit from the incremental spend? Is it the kind of spend that should immediately impact sales in Q4, or is more of brand building longer term?","Richard D. Moss","So let me start off with the bridge for the SG&A. You're right, it was actually up $1 million year-over-year. But $8 million -- we did incrementally spend $8 million in media. We saw reductions in both our distribution costs and our general and administrative overhead costs.","Gerald W. Evans","In regard to the spending itself and what it was invested in, in the third quarter, we invested behind our Hanes Men's business and the innovations in that line, as well as we launched the Hanes women's panties campaign, and we invested in the Playtex brand. In the fourth quarter, we'll continue to invest predominately behind the Hanes men's and women's campaigns, so you would expect the majority of that spending to be in the Innerwear portion of our business.","Richard A. Noll","And this is Rich. I'll just take the benefits question. You want to think about media as not giving you an immediately -- an impact on sales. It's a cumulative effect about building brand power and talking to consumers about the platform innovations that you have. And so you want to think about it more as a longer-term or midterm investment rather than something that's going to impact sales in the short term. But it's one of the major reasons our Innovate-to-Elevate is working.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik from BB&T Capital Markets.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Couple of questions on Maidenform and then one on cotton. First, on cotton, Rick, any reason not to think of the next 3 quarters just based on where you buy and use cotton should still be a tailwind year-over-year? I have it sort of through Q2 of next year. And then on Maidenform, the sale that you projected about $550 million is a little lower than where they thought it was going come out for this year. So are you already starting to rationalize that business? If so, where? And then Rich, you talked about selling Maidenform products in your outlet stores. So that again begs the question, why keep their stores opened? Because I don't think that's part of your accretion guidance.","Richard D. Moss","Hello, Scott. This is Rick. I'll start off with the cotton question. The answer is yes, we do, for the next -- at least the next couple of quarters, we should see favorability though I would caution you that the favorability won't be nearly what we've seen in the past. It's -- we've been in a much more stable cotton environment for the last, really, several months. And so it won't be as big -- nearly as big an impact as we've seen in recent quarters.","Richard A. Noll","And then, Scott, this is Rich. In terms of the Maidenform, basically, their year is unfolding pretty much how we had assumed it was built into our assumptions, actually, when we announced the acquisition in July. They were, I think, about $600 million in sales last year. Their earlier projections for the full year were in that $560 million, $570 million range. We're now calling it about $550 million for the year. And that was driven by a number -- the competitive pressures they had already called out. We were already mindful of in building into our overall assumptions. We talked about it continuing to go down from there. That's why we've talked about it adding in slightly over $500 million of good core quality profitable sales. Because at the end of the day, they were driving the top line at the expense of the bottom line. And so their quality of revenue wasn't that superb, and one of our goals will be to continually remix that quality so that we're able to mix sustainable profits and great returns over time. We've talked about exiting some of the private label that they have, which hasn't happened yet, but will upcoming. And we intend to get all of those types of things done pretty quickly, so it's not a drag on our top line, so just in line with how we expect. In terms of the outlet stores, do you want to talk about that, Gerald?","Gerald W. Evans","In terms of the outlet stores, they have just around 66 outlet stores, I believe it is, that we'll add to our group, and they operate their outlet stores in very much the same manner we do. They manage it for a 4-wall profitability. So in effect, they're profitable sales generators that we will add to our portfolio. In the malls, where we don't both have a store, we'll actually cross-sell their products in our stores and then get incremental sales as well. So it's a profitable sales generator for us.","Operator","And our next question from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Rick, just a clarification on the revenue guidance. I'm just having trouble understanding exactly what's slightly more than the $4.6 billion and slightly more than the $1.2 billion means. I mean, if you take your year-to-date sales and add $1.2 billion, you certainly don't get over $4.6 billion. So is the Q4 revenue guidance closer to like $1.26 billion to $1.27 billion? And as another way to think about it, you're planning the business flat x Maidenform, is that how we should approach it?","Richard D. Moss","Yes, David, exactly, and I apologize for the confusion on that. The -- yes, the way we're looking at revenue for the fourth quarter and then for the full year is -- the midpoint of our guidance assumes revenue's flat last year. Our revenues in the quarter were $1.153 billion. Then you add $120 million on for Maidenform, which gets you into the range that you were talking about somewhere north of $1.250 billion. When you add to the $3 billion, $3.42 billion year-to-date sales, you come up with a number slightly above $4.6 billion.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So it sounds like the adjustment to your original guidance x Maidenform it's -- Q3 shortfall is the majority of it, and then a slight adjustment to Q4 in the core Hanes business based on, I guess, what you're forecasting more on average trend similar to Q3 as opposed to your run rate over the last 8 or 9 weeks.","Richard D. Moss","You're spot on, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question just about your -- just a follow-up on the fourth quarter guidance. Just trying to kind of back into the margin assumptions. I know that there's some marketing shifts and there's some negative mix from Maidenform. And Rick, if you could provide some more clarity around, either it's vis-\u00e0-vis legacy or consolidated, how to think about gross margin versus SG&A.","Richard D. Moss","Well, we try to give you a gross margin on a quarterly basis. But let me give you some things to think about. We walked you through the sales guidance for Q4. I pointed out a couple of other things. Taposh, you're right, the Maidenform in the fourth quarter will have the effect of averaging us down on an operating profit margin basis by about 50 basis points. If you look then at the $16 million of incremental media -- pardon me, $18 million of incremental media that Gerald talked about in the fourth quarter, that's going to be about 1.5 points of margin. So you want to factor those in to get to the operating profit. The implied operating profit range in the quarter is about $137 million to $147 million. And we'll have about $6 million to $8 million of operating profit from Maidenform, is our guess right now.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then Rich, just, again, on Maidenform, at the time of the announcement, you described some competitive issues, particularly within the Shapewear business. I know you're planning pretty conservatively on the top line. But I guess, the question is how confident are you that you could stabilize those issues longer term? I think Hanes has historically spent 4% of marketing -- or 4% of sales on marketing. Maidenform, I think, has spent 1\/2 of that. I know they're different categories. You have a lot of Michael Jordan and Charlie Sheen expenses, so to speak. Do you feel like they were underspending when it comes to marketing?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. So let me hit some of the tactical things, but then talk about it sort of more broadly. When you look at what we define as media and marketing and what they define as media and marketing, it's 2 totally different things. It was much more of a retail-push type of business rather than a consumer-driven pull business, which is what we run. So from our perspective, they didn't really spend any money on media or platform innovation to communicate to consumers in a big way, and that will be part of what we change in Innovate-to-Elevate. There is no question about it. You need brand power, big meaningful innovation to consumers, and you need to be able to take those big meaningful innovations and internalize them into a supply chain. And all 3 of those things can work synergistically to drive your margins up. And part of that will be an investment in media, which will be self-funding. In terms of the -- I think the other part of your question was the competitive environment in shapewear and things like that. This was pretty crystal clear where you actually had a couple of competitors, where there wasn't a lot of cross-selling within different retail accounts. And when you would have -- Maidenform might have a high share in an account and another competitor would come in, over time you would see exactly how those shares would short of shake out. It's very predictable. We know exactly what was happening, and it's unfolding just as we had thought, as they had thought. And we can see where it's going to sort of settle out in the next year or so. So we feel very good about their strong position in shapewear combined with the Hanes business and the Maidenform business. We'll have a leading share in shapewear, and I'm confident in our ability to drive Innovate-to-Elevate through that and continue to improve the overall business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One quick one on Maidenform. You mentioned there's a couple of facilities you'll be exiting. Are there any expected proceeds from asset sales?","Richard D. Moss","We're still working through a lot of that, Carla, at this point. I think as we give our further guidance for 2014, I think we'll be able to give you a better sense of how some of that sort of thing will shake out.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to T.C. Robillard for any concluding remarks.","T.C. Robillard","Thank you.

For today' call, Gerald and Scott will provide some brief remarks, and then, we'll open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thank you, TC. Hanesbrands delivered a solid fourth quarter with record cash flow. Over our results we are once again right in line with our guidance and demonstrate that our multiyear strategy to improve our business is working.","Key highlights in the quarter include operating cash flow that exceeded the high end of our guidance for both the quarter and the full year. We delivered on our commitment to bring our leverage back within our target range. We saw continued strong performances in International, Consumer-Direct and Champion.","And adjusted gross margin improved 130 basis points over prior year driven by increases in both our U.S. Innerwear and U.S. Activewear segments. And U.S. innerwear's operating profit and operating margin increased over prior year, with both metrics exceeding our guidance in the quarter despite lower than expected revenue. We believe this is an indication that U.S. Innerwear's profit has begun to stabilize.","In addition to U.S. innerwear's fourth quarter profit performance, we saw two additional developments that point to improving revenue and profit trends in 2020. First, our intimates business improved sequentially and was in line with our expectations for the quarter. The strong performance was driven by our Bra business which increased over the prior year as our revitalization efforts and product innovations such as EasyLite and DreamWire continued to gain traction.","And second, while early store resets by a major retailer had a short-term impact on basic sales in the quarter, we're pleased with the longer term potential this reset holds for our business. Within the stores that have been reset, we're gaining shelf space and we're gaining market share. Once completed, we believe this reset should have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year.","Over the past several years we have executed a strategy to diversify our business and position the company for increased earnings growth and shareholder returns. To accomplish this we set five specific goals and we've delivered on each as highlighted by our fourth quarter and full-year results.","First, we have diversified our revenue. International revenue now accounts for 36% of sales, up from 11% in 2013. Consumer-Direct revenue which represented 30% of fourth quarter sales and 25% of full-year sales is up from 9% in 2013. And on a constant currency basis, global Champion excluding C9 generated more than $1.9 billion of revenue in 2019, an increase of more than $1.1 billion in just three years.","Second, we've consistently delivered organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth and we accomplished this despite challenges in our U.S. business that included a muted holiday and a $46 million headwind from exited programs.","Third, we've positioned the business for higher levels of profitability over the next several years by exiting unprofitable businesses and restructuring our supply chain to lower cost. We believe our supply chain restructuring initiatives have positioned U.S. innerwear and the company for improving margins over the next two years. We also believe this represents an important milestone for U.S. innerwear as it remains a critical driver of our strong cash flow.","Fourth, we're generating higher levels of operating cash flow and 2019 operating cash flow increased 25% over the prior year to more than $800 million. This is approximately $200 million higher than our cash flow from just three years ago. And fifth, we have reduced our net debt by more than $1.1 billion in less than two years. We ended the year at 2.9 times levered on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis which is a full turn lower than our peak. Now that we're back within our long-term range of 2 to 3 times our priority for 2020 is to use our excess free cash to buy back stock.","The focus of our entire organization for the past several years has been on strengthening our business to return to a model that is able to magnify sales growth into faster operating profit growth and ultimately even faster EPS growth. With a lot of heavy lifting done and our program exits behind us, we believe 2020 represents an inflection point for our company, one that reveals the underlying strength of our ongoing business and unleashes the full potential of our capital allocation model to drive accelerated shareholder returns.","Turning to our 2020 guidance, through the remainder of my remarks and for comparison purposes, I'll be referencing our rebased 2019 results, which adjust for the exits of C9 and Target and our DKNY Intimates license. This will provide a clear view of the underlying trends within our business.","Using the midpoint, our 2020 guidance implies approximately 3% revenue growth. This is driven by strong performances in International, Consumer-Direct, and Champion. And while we continue to plan conservatively with respect to our U.S. innerwear business, we expect improved revenue trends in 2020 in both basics and intimates.","Our guidance for U.S. innerwear assumes revenue growth ranging from down 1% to up 1% for the full year. And for the total company, we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 7% as our investment spending normalizes and cost savings from our supply chain restructuring flow through, particularly within our U.S. innerwear segment where we expect operating profit to be up over prior year.","With lower interest expense and lower share count, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to accelerate to 15%. Embedded in our guidance is $200 million of share repurchases and we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of operating cash flow.","So in closing, we delivered solid performances for the quarter and the full year and as our 2020 outlook suggest we believe we have reached an inflection point in our business model. With our exited programs behind us and all of our capital allocation tools at our disposal, we believe we are well positioned for accelerating earnings growth and shareholder returns over the next several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Lewis, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is serving as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Scott has held leading roles in our strong global finance organization since the company went public and is providing us with a seamless leadership transition to support our goals and strategies. Scott?","Scott Lewis","Thanks, Gerald. Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a supplemental document on our IR website that reflects revisions to our prior period results. These revisions primarily relate to adjustments to our income tax balances. The revisions had minor cumulative earnings per share impact of $0.01 over the three-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additional information can be found in our FAQ document as well as in our 10-K.","Now let me discuss the quarter. Overall we reported solid fourth quarter results. Revenue, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were in line with our guidance. While cash flow from operations exceeded the high end of our range for the quarter shows a $1.75 billion on a constant currency basis, as well as increased slightly over prior year. Our [indiscernible] results reflect $46 million with expected headwinds in our activewear segment from the exited or commodity programs and the mass channel as well as a planned wind down of C9 and Target.","Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points over the last year to 41.4% driven by higher margins in both our innerwear and activewear segments. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $263 million and included $3 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% increased approximately 40 basis points over the prior year as our strong gross margin performance more than offset higher distribution costs and an unexpected bad debt charge of $3 million related to a retailer bankruptcy in Australia. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.51, an increase over the prior year of 13% and 24% respectively.","In the quarter we generated $559 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $57 million compared to prior year. For the full-year we generated a record $803 million dollars in cash flows from operations. With respect to the balance sheet, as compared to last year, we reduced our inventory balance by more than $150 million and we paid down over $600 million of debt.","Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.9 times on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down one full-term from our peak in the first quarter of 2018 and brings us back within our target range of 2 to 3 times.","With that summary, let me take through our fourth quarter segment performance. As compared to last year, U.S. innerwear sales declined 4%. However, operating profit increased 5% as our operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.6%. The operating profit and margin exceeded our forecast in the quarter as the benefits from earlier price increases and lower distribution expenses more than offset higher commodity cost and lower unit volume.","For the quarter basics revenue declined 5% due to the impact of door closings and an earlier than planned disruption from store resets at a large mass retailer. While these resets are causing short term fluctuations, we believe once completed this will have a positive impact on our basics business beginning in the second half of this year.","And with respect to our Intimates business, as expected, our trends improved sequentially driven by our bra business. For the quarter, bra revenue increased slightly and operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points over the last year as our revitalization efforts and new product innovations gained traction.","Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment, sales declined nearly 7% over the last year and were slightly better than our forecast. [indiscernible] result was $46 million of expected year-over-year headwinds I referenced earlier. As compared to prior year, Champion activewear sales, excluding C9 increased 14%. C9 revenue declined 26% or $26 million. And sales in the remainder of our Activewear segment declined approximately $30 million, which was better than our forecast.","Activewear's operating margin of 15.8% declined 30 basis points over the prior year. Activewear's gross margin increased in the quarter driven by the benefits of our remixing activity including a higher mix of Champion sales. This was more than offset by higher SG&A expense including higher distribution cost.","In our International segment, revenue increased nearly 7% and was above our forecast driven by stronger than expected results in better activewear and innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis international sales increased 10% or $60 million over the prior year with mid single-digit growth in innerwear and 22% growth in Champion.","International's operating margin of 14.9% declined 130 basis points over the last year as the benefits from higher sales were more than offset as short-term FX transaction cost pressures, as well as the $3 million Australia bad debt expense I referenced earlier. Touching briefly on our global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 22% over the last year and were in line with our expectation. This consisted of 22% growth in both our domestic and international Champion businesses.","And now turning to guidance, representative comparison of our ongoing business between 2020 and 2019, we've provided a supplemental table on our IR website. This table provides a rebased financial information for 2019 that adjusts for the exits of C9 and Target and the DKNY Intimates license. During my guidance discussion, all year-over-year comparisons were referenced our rebased 2019 results. I'll also point you to our press release and FAQ document for additional guidance details.","However, I would like to share a few thoughts to frame our 2020 outlook. We expect solid growth with enhanced profitability even as the first quarter is expected to see difficult comparisons. With a strong balance sheet our capital allocation strategy is expected to drive accelerating earnings per share growth and we've identified additional cost reduction actions those we've begun last year is to generate further profit improvements in 2021 and beyond.","Our 2020 guidance demonstrates accelerating growth rates as we move down the P&L. At the midpoint our full year guidance implies revenue growth that is approaching 3% and adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 7%. With expected benefits from lower interest expense and $200 million dollars of share repurchase planned early in the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 15%.","We expect to generate $700 million to $800 million in cash flows from operations. After any additional capital allocation initiatives this year, we expect our leverage to decline 2.7 times by year end. With respect to our restructuring and other actions, we expect approximately $50 million of charges in 2020. Approximately $10 million of these charges are costs related to the exits of C9 and the DKNY license.","Approximately $10 million related to our 2019 supply chain restructuring which were previously planned. The remainder of the charges are focused on additional actions to further reduce costs primarily within our supply chain. In isolation we expect these restructuring actions to deliver approximately $40 million of incremental profit with $30 million coming in 2021 and remaining $10 million coming in 2022.","Touching on the first quarter, we expect [indiscernible] revenue and operating profit growth due to transitory and timing issues in the International and U.S. innerwear segments. Within U.S. innerwear we are facing headwinds from a large socks shipment at last year's first quarter as we displaced a competitor and a large value retailer.","We also expect continued short term disruption in our basics business when I previously discussed store reset at a large mass retailer. International constant currency revenue growth is expected to slow to 2% in the quarter before returning to mid single-digit in the second quarter due to the timing of the Asia expansion this year compared to last year. And International's first quarter operating profit is expected to decline due to the increased investments to support our Asia expansion as well as short-term FX transactional cost pressures.","For the rest of the year we expect revenue and operating profit growth as we benefit from the continued momentum in our intimates business, the completion of store resets in the mass channel, expanded distribution in Asia, cost savings from our supply chain restructuring, and price increases in certain international markets to offset the cost pressures and foreign exchange rates.","In closing, we delivered solid results for both the quarter and full-year. We delivered on a number of initiatives to improve our business model. And as our outlook suggests, we believe we've reached an inflection point now, as our program exits are behind us and we've brought back our leverage within our targeted range. We believe the combination of our strength and business model, our strong balance sheet, and all of our capital allocation tools, position us for accelerating earnings growth and total shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to TC.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Scott. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and we will continue as time allows. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask - nice quarter guys, I wanted to ask for a little bit more color around the basics reset, what's happening in kind of core basics business? I think it sounds like something is going on at the mass retailer, sounds like an opportunity for shelf space, but may be you can give us a little bit more color on what's happening there, how to expect it to kind of flow through the P&L and timing of when that part of the business might reaccelerate again? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Hi Omar, it's Gerald. Thanks for the question and we are pleased with the fourth quarter, our record cash flow and double-digit EPS growth and our inline guidance really speaks to what we've been doing to improve our business model. We really do look to 2020 as an inflection point for this business and an important part of that is the underlying strength of our ongoing businesses. And then part of that is innerwear and we did see improvement from a profitability standpoint certainly at the end of 2019.","As we look to 2020 we do expect the revenue to improve as we work through the store resets in the large retailer. The large retailer started their reset at the end of last year in 2019 a little earlier than we had expected and as you see with resets you sell off of exited SKUs and businesses and so forth that can create some short-term interruption. But what we do see and what we like is our space is expanding and with that space expansion we're seeing our share expand.","So the balance of the chain resets to the first part of 2020, but we expect as we get past that and then as we get to the second half we will pick up the tailwind of that on our innerwear business and the benefit we saw from share expansion in the initial reset along with the improving trends we're seeing out of our intimates business on the revenue side we expect to offset and pick up the additional restructure - cost restructure benefits that we implemented in 2019 towards the second half.","So we really do expect a stabilization of our revenue line as we work through the balance of 2020 and we expect the operating profit to be up. And so we're very encouraged by that and that's an important punctuation on our strong cash flow as well and we see our profit growing within innerwear.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay sole","Great, thank you so much. So I have a two part question, number one is, Scott can you may be give us a little bit of a direction on how do you expect gross margin to play out for this year? And then secondly, the press release mentioned something about identify controlled efficiencies that comes through the material weakness in internal control, can you just give us an idea of what that means and what some of the actions you've already taken and say we're continuing to take over the year to address that situation? Thank you.","Gerald Evans","Yes, hi. This is Gerald. Let me take the gross margin part and I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the revision part of the question. From a gross margins standpoint we would expect our gross margins to strengthen as we work through the year and we've got a number of restructure initiatives that we undertook in 2019 that will flow through in 2020 as it works its way up the balance sheet into the second half of the year. So you would expect that to ramp along with our revenue is ramping in the first, as we get - overlap some of headwinds in the first quarter of 2020. So Scott, would you, do you want to take shot?","Scott Lewis","Yes, thanks Gerald, and good morning, and thanks for your question. About the revision just to put some context around this item, the impact of the revision adjustment had a minor cumulative earnings per share impact to us of $0.01 over the three-year period of 2017 to 2019. And I think it is important to understand as we look forward this tax issue will not impact our tax rate. As we move forward we continue to expect the tax rate in the mid teens.","We discovered the issue as we were preparing our year-end financial statements this year and the issue revolves around or relates to the tax treatment of intercompany inventory transactions and ultimately impacted our prior period of tax balances. Now when we identified this, we've quantified it and we revised prior period financial statements to correct for these errors. We also addressed it for other immaterial outer period and for the same time.","And you mentioned the controls, and from a controls perspective, we already are making some process improvements in this area. We actually, when the process improvements that we were working through helped identify this issue. We ultimately did conclude that this was a material weakness. We have and we will continue to refine and enhance controls in this area and we're taking this very seriously and we intend to implement these enhancements over the course of 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Anderson with B Riley, FBR. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson","Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe quantify a bit how much the Innerwear business is impacted next year by C9, DKNY and then the door closures? And then also, how you're thinking about the growth of Champion sales in 2020 as we go throughout the year, both domestically and internationally, and the impacts of the Asia distribution expansion? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Sure. Let me look at - let me start with the C9 portion of your question. It's in the rebased numbers that we looked at on the basics or the Innerwear side of things, and it was approximately $42 million of sales that was in Innerwear basics. We have recovered the vast majority of that, but it's a bit masked in the rebased numbers because as we plan for 2020, we also assumed there would be the impact of door closures of about $35 million to $40 million.","So they offset in the numbers, but I think you should take solace in knowing that we have planned conservatively on the Innerwear side and as we begin to hear about door closures in other places we have those covered in our guidance as we look toward 2020.","So, we feel we've appropriately planned the Innerwear business from the standpoint of being conservative yet, and the phasing of that business as we also see the revenue and profitability ramp throughout the year. So we feel good about that business and where it's positioned and appropriately planned from a conservative standpoint. On the Asia...?","T.C. Robillard","Champion just kind of how the year maybe unfolds for growth?","Gerald Evans","Yes, from the Champion business, first of all let me just say, last year Champion had another - we finished really well in the fourth quarter. Champion was up 22% in the fourth quarter again, and it was 22% domestically and 22% internationally. And just to give you a sense of how big that business is becoming it's about $460 million globally in the quarter and it finished up 40% for the year.","So as we look at 2020, we expect to surpass the $2 billion mark. We expect to do another year of double-digit growth for Champion. We are overlapping some very large comps in the first part of the year. So we've planned to mid- to high-single digit growth rate for Champion in the first half of the year and a double-digit growth in the second half of the year - low-double digit growth in the second half of the year.","So we're continuing to be very bullish on Champion and its ability to continue to grow. We've seen strong POS. We saw strong POS through the holiday periods around the world as well and we are well on our way obviously to reach our $2 billion goal in 2020 two years early, and we believe we can add the next billion in the next four to five years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, good morning, everyone. Gerald, two questions. In the FAQ, there is some commentary about finding a new C9 partner and something new revenue stream in the second half, but it sounds like it should be minimal. Just any more color on that would be really helpful. It's interesting that you guys are able to get a partner for the brand.","And then secondarily, there was a big department store that talked about a 3-year store closing program. Just curious if you could let us know how that impacts your multi-year view of Innerwear? How tied to those 125 doors you are? Just anything there over the next 3 years would be helpful as well.","Gerald Evans","Sure. Let me start Ike with this C9 part of the question. C9 has continued to perform well right through the balance of 2019, really exceeded our expectations through the balance of 2019. And it's clear to us that there is a strong consumer base out there that's very loyal to that brand. We are in the final stages of discussions with a new partner and we expect to launch that program - initial program in the second half of this year.","Relatively small to start with, and as you noted, it is in our guidance at this point in time, but it has the potential to ramp nicely over time as we get the program going. So we'll provide some more specifics on that in the coming months, but we're very pleased to have the opportunity to keep that brand in the market and satisfy those consumers.","From the standpoint of the department store information, the vast majority of the business we do in Macy's is it on macys.com and in their largest stores and that's where all of our really growth comes from on that account. As noted in the announcement, the stores targeted for closure are a small part of their total business, and while the closure list has not yet been fully communicated, we believe the doors targeted for closure do not represent a material part of our business.","In regards to 2020 as I noted in my earlier comments, we had planned the possibility of additional door closures in the market and we feel that we have the initial 30 covered in our guidance, and as the list develops, we'll continue to assess that, but we feel we've got it covered in our guidance for 2020.","I think, once again, it reinforces what we've been focused on for a while is the consumers choice of where they shop and their shopping habits continues to evolve and we've been focusing over the last few years on diversifying our revenue base and where we sell and particularly developing our consumer direct piece of the business, which is - as we noted in our comments was 25% of our business in the last year.","And so, macys.com is part of that, as well as pure plays, and as well as our own site. So we'll continue to diversify, where we sell to meet the shifting needs of the consumer. So we feel good about where we have Innerwear going and that will continue and the Innerwear is one of our fastest growing Consumer-Direct businesses.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy","Thanks, good morning, guys. Nice job with the cash flows and the balance sheet. So this gives you some newfound balance sheet flexibility into 2020, you're looking at the implied cash flow outlook for '20 well in excess of the dividend obligation and the $200 million in planned repurchases. Does the balance go to debt reduction or could you see repurchases beyond that $200 million?","Gerald Evans","Hi Jim. It's Gerald, and thanks for that. We have definitely focused on delevering as you know, and we're very proud to have achieved that goal. It gives us a lot of flexibility and we are very disciplined on our capital allocation approach. We have noted that our intent is to use the $200 million of excess cash to repurchase shares. That will allow us to continue to delever. We'll assess as we work through the year, but certainly getting solidly back in our range gives us significant amount of flexibility and in exercising our full capital allocation. So we'll work through the year, but we are very pleased to be back within our range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather Balsky","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First, with regards to your Champion guidance for next year, can you just talk about the different components in terms of Activewear and International and how you're thinking about the growth there? And then also in terms of your cash flow guidance, if you could just help with a little more color, how do we think about some of the moving pieces especially working capital? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Sure. Let me take the first half of that and I'll let Scott take the second half of that. From the standpoint of Champion, we expect to continue to see the balanced growth really between International and the domestic piece, it is growing nicely. Actually the Innerwear piece of our Champion is growing at a very rapid rate as well, and it's helping drive that total strong growth that we're seeing around the world. So we expect both the Activewear and Innerwear elements of our Champion business to grow.","As we've said before, we've been very successful in the men's business. We still have room to grow as we develop a greater share in the women's business as well as the kids business and outerwear represents a new category for us as well. So we see multiple areas that we can continue to expand the business as well as continue to grow of course, where we have distribution today. Scott?","Scott Lewis","Yes, excellent. I appreciate your question, and good morning. We are very proud of the record level of cash flow that we had in 2019. The team did a fantastic job this year. We had a good improvement in our cash cycle days. We felt this takes us to a new level. From my brief and reinforces our ability to generate cash flows. Our operating cash flows in '19, we accomplished that through strong GAAP net income and working capital management.","And as you think about 2020 cash flow levels, our guidance is $700 million to $800 million. You can arrive at that in a couple of ways and one way is looking at our 2020 GAAP net income at the midpoint is around $585 million. If you add back our non-cash items like depreciation and amortization and stock compensation, which is typically around $180 million to $190 million. You may arrive at the mid-point within that guidance range.","Another way of thinking about it is if you look at our 2019 cash flow level of $803 million. Our 2020 GAAP net income is at the midpoint is around $20 million lower than '19 as we talked about the program exits, and just using the same working capital assumption that we had in '19, which is actually flat for that year, we arrive right within that guidance range again.","So, we thought this is a prudent way of looking at cash flows in 2020 and we like again, we're in a really good position to drive strong cash flows in 2020 and beyond. And this is helping with strong returns and again like Gerald mentioned earlier, this gives us opportunities to continue to lever for share repurchases and really drive shareholder return.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Would you please help us understand a bit better what drove the bra revenue increase in the fourth quarter? And if you anticipate that carrying forward as part of the flattish rebased full-year guidance for Innerwear, despite retailer door closures? Or put another way, would you quantify what level of bra growth is baked into your 2020 plans?","Gerald Evans","Sure. From the standpoint of what drove that growth, it was - we certainly have been working on a revitalization program for some time now within the intimates business and one of our key elements of our bra expansion was innovation and we've seen both our DreamWire and our EasyLite innovations performed very well. And as you may recall we paired that with both online, our digital support as well as TV support in the case of Bali, EasyLite.","So we saw a nice traction from the standpoint of those launches and we've seen it ramp and we expect it will continue to ramp, particularly as we get through the - into the later quarters of the year. So we are expecting actually growth out of our intimates business next year in the guidance that we gave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. It seems like you took some price on the Innerwear side did help margins in that segment. Can you just maybe talk about how your retail partners have adjusted their pricing, what sort of sell-throughs that they are seeing just basically what's the consumer reception to the price increases? And also I just wanted to make sure on the international side, you mentioned some bad debt that negatively hurt your profits this past quarter. Was that a one-time thing or do you expect any more of that to continue in F\u201920? Thanks.","Scott Lewis","Sure, from the pricing question, we've implemented our pricing in Innerwear really last February, so February of 2019. You may recall at the time we were pricing because commodity is it peaked ahead of that pricing and we put that pricing in place. So it's been in place a long time. We've generally seen that the pricing in the market is settled out around it and so forth. What we're seeing now though is the pricing continues to lap itself that the peak of the commodities is passed, and we're actually seeing margin improvement as the commodity costs begin to ramp down and the pricing overlaps and so we're seeing that now.","As we look to Innerwear in the second half of 2020, we get the added benefit of the supply chain restructurings that we had executed in 2019 will work their way out the balance sheet and give us added improvement in our operating margins and profit within Innerwear in particular. From the standpoint of the international bad debt, that was a bankruptcy in Australia and we would expect that to be an individual event not something that's ongoing there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Swartz with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","David Swartz","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on the new distribution agreements for Champion in South Korea and China? And also do you think that the health crisis in China will affect store openings this year? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Sure. From the standpoint of the distribution agreements we have two new partners, one in Korea and one in China, as you noted. From the standpoint of their - how they will flow, they are planned for later in the year. So at this point in time, we do not see the current issue having an impact on that business.","You may recall that our Chinese commercial businesses is fairly small today, less than 1%. From the standpoint of that overall issue, we're taking it very seriously and it's an evolving issue. We have stopped our own travel of our employees as well as we're watching very carefully from the standpoint of our vendors and we will keep that travel stopped until we see that the illnesses is stopped or ceased.","From the standpoint of our business, we don't see it having any meaningful impact on our business at this time and we certainly are working on contingency plans, either from a sourcing standpoint or business standpoint. But back to your original question, we feel good about those distributors and they'll have more of a second half impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gerald, you mentioned and called out Champion hitting your Target earlier than you had anticipated and you mentioned $1 billion in incremental top line that you thought the brand could generate. Can you walk us through how you're getting there and just the bridge between distribution growth in North America and International kind of how we should think about that $1 billion in revenue opportunity you're talking to?","Gerald Evans","Sure, as we began to look at it from the standpoint of the next billion, we see it has continued to be a global expansion. And in many ways some of the categories I touched on earlier, important elements of that, the drive from simply being predominantly a men's brand to one that becomes across genders and includes a kid's business as well, it would obviously include an important ramping in markets like Asia where we think there's tremendous opportunity for further expansion in our Europe markets. And within the U.S. market, for example, we have pretty solid distribution that's where you would expect certainly us to build a bigger business across women and kids as well.","And then there are categories out there that we really don't play in such as outerwear and we also are in the midst of partnering with a company on some initial shoe offerings as well. So we see lots of avenues to grow and we would say it sort of being consistent growth over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Carla Casella","Hi, you talked about both the shelf space gains and losses and I think you gave us some nice clarity on the intimates in Korea and in China. But can you just give a timing of, was that the only major change in shelf space this year or was there something else that was embedded in one of the other categories that I missed?","Gerald Evans","No, I think at this time shelf space, we're fairly stable from a shelf space and when I speak to you about that and the shelf space, I'm speaking more on the Innerwear side of things. Shelf space is fairly stable. We do see the solidification of the basics space within the mass channels as we referred to earlier. But we feel good about our shelf space and our innovations behind it, of course on the Activewear side and Champion in particular, we're continuing to drive distribution expansion in the U.S. as well as globally. So we have a nice trend there as well.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to T.C.

Noll","Thank you, T.C. Let me start off by saying how pleased we are to report strong second quarter results that include record operating margins and earnings. When you consider the current soft retail environment, this is a significant accomplishment and one that underscores a very simple message. Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working very well. We had a record 15% operating margin in the quarter and our success is broad-based. We saw all 4 segments improve versus last year and our 3 largest segments: Innerwear, Activewear and International produced double-digit operating margins.","The core tenant of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is straightforward, expand our margins by leveraging our strong brands, innovation platforms and our global supply chain. And we are seeing it work across all of our innovation platforms: Smart Sizes; TAGLESS; ComfortBlend and now, X-TEMP. And these platforms are not only benefiting our financial performance, they are also helping our retail partners, as our innovative products drive higher consumer demand, higher average unit selling prices and higher productivity levels.","The momentum we are seeing from Innovate-to-Elevate, along with our strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise our 2013 guidance. We're taking up our EPS range $0.25 and our free cash flow range, $100 million. This updated guidance places us firmly within our target operating margin range of 12% to 14%, a year earlier than anticipated. And we are just getting started. The true earnings power of our business is only beginning to shine through. Significant earnings potential remains as we push to the higher end of our operating margin goal.","When you combine the current momentum in our business, coupled with a $0.10 to $0.15 contribution from Maidenform, a reasonable goal for 2014 EPS is in the low $4 range.","So to wrap up, our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is working, our margins are expanding, our cash flow is increasing and when you couple all that with Maidenform, we see significant earnings potential that could drive performance for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich. We're very excited about the improvement we've seen in the second quarter across all of our businesses, as our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continues to demonstrate the power of combining our great brands, meaningful innovation and global supply chain. Before we look at the highlights in the quarter, I'd like to share our perspective on the retail environment.","If you remember, sell-through at retail was particularly weak in Q1 due to traffic disruptions and weather. It improved somewhat in Q2, but is still choppy overall. This retail softness negatively impacted our shipments in Innerwear basics in Q1 and in intimate apparel mainly in Q2. Retail inventories are now on the right levels and have normalized to where we feel good about retailers' weeks of supply heading into the back-to-school selling period.","Now I'd like to give you an update on our innovation platforms and their growing success as we push these platforms across Innerwear and Activewear. First, our Smart Sizes platform, which represents nearly 1\/3 of our bras, continued to build momentum across our Bra and Sportswear business with sales at retail increasing by 30% in the quarter. Our TAGLESS platform also continue to expand in the quarter. Shipments of our new TAGLESS bottoms are strong and we continue to leverage this platform across many different categories. Our third platform, ComfortBlend, continues to expand as well. It now encompasses socks, male and women's underwear and is rolling out in our Activewear business.","I'd also like to update you on a new innovation we previewed at Investor Day, it's called X-TEMP and it leverages temperature-regulating technology to keep you comfortable all day. X-TEMP carries a meaningful price premium at retail of over 50% compared to our core cotton products and nearly 20% over our ComfortBlend products. It has gained a tremendous amount of traction right out of the gate and we are very excited about the results. While X-TEMP started as a product innovation, it has now been elevated to become our fourth innovation platform, which we will use to gain incremental shelf space, as we expand it into other categories.","Turning to our segments. I'd like to start today with Activewear where our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy has lifted operating margins to over 12% in the quarter, driving innovation in Champion and deemphasizing the commodity product and branded printwear were the key components for the profit improvement. For the first half, Activewear margins were just over 10%, a first for this segment. And I believe we should see margins continue in the low double digits on a consistent basis.","In Innerwear, we saw very strong profitability, driven by improvements across both Basics and Intimates. Men's Underwear and Socks led the way with double-digit sales increases and strong margin expansion. In Intimates, despite the inventory adjustment at retail in the quarter, our full figure bra business, which includes Bali, Playtex and Just My Size, was up about 4%.","Media continued to run ahead of last year in the quarter, as our ComfortBlend and TAGLESS ads featuring Michael Jordan were aired around Father's Day. While our media spending has increased approximately $10 million year-to-date, we are on track to spend the full incremental $30 million to $40 million for the year. In Q3, we will begin to substantially increase our media spending as we launch new campaigns featuring Hanes panties and Playtex bras. We will also continue to support our Basics categories through the balance of the year.","Finally, in our International segment, sales for the quarter declined 1%, but were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit increased 7% and our operating margin was back in the low double digits. We continue to execute our regionalization strategy, where we are aligning our international businesses into 4 key regions in order to leverage both our regional expertise and global supply chain and to more quickly introduce our innovation platforms across geographies. However, currency is shaping up to be a bigger headwind in the second half and is expected to knock 10 full percentage points off sales growth in our International segment, because approximately half of our business is weighted to countries that have rapidly depreciating currencies such as Brazil, Argentina, Japan and Australia.","On a constant currency basis, we actually expect sales to continue to increase in the low to mid single digits. So to wrap up, I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As Rich said, we are seeing the results of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. It's great to see Activewear with a year-to-date operating margin above 10% and focused on delivering profitable growth. As we turn our attention to executing back-to-school with our retail partners, we are cautiously optimistic about the consumer, but feel our strong brands are well positioned going into this key selling period.","I will now turn the call over to Rick to discuss our financial performance.","Richard D. Moss","Thanks, Gerald. Let me start by discussing our record earnings, as this illustrates the success of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and our ability to execute our plans and highlights just how much the recession and the hyperinflation in cotton mask the true earnings power of our business model.","EPS for the quarter was $1.19, an increase of 78% from last year. Let me talk to you about how we were able to achieve those record earnings for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up about 2% versus prior year. Adjusting for the planned decline in branded printwear of $5 million and a currency headwind of $7 million, sales were up closer to 3% in the quarter.","Operating profit increased 51% from last year to $181 million, representing a record margin of 15.1%. The key driver of this improvement was our gross profit margin, which was 36.3%, an increase of 520 basis points from last year's rate, with about 100 to 150 basis points coming from Innovate-to-Elevate. While you haven't seen it for a few years because of cotton, this year, we expect a more normal seasonal pattern for gross margins with Q2 being the high watermark for the year.","SG&A in the quarter increased $7 million from last year, of which $6 million was from planned increases in media spending. And interest expense declined $11 million from last year, as a result of paying down long-term debt.","Moving to the balance sheet where we continue to drive improvements, inventories declined $99 million from the same period last year with about half of the decline coming from lower units in inventory.","I'd now like to spend some time on our updated 2013 guidance. With respect to sales, we slightly lowered our full year guidance to approximately $4.55 billion from our prior level of approximately $4.6 billion, due to the sales softness in the first half and the currency headwinds Gerald highlighted in his earlier remarks. To help with the currency impact in the context of total company sales, it's expected to lower the second half growth rate by a full percentage point. We raised our operating profit guidance to $550 million to $575 million from our prior range of $500 million to $550 million, implying an operating margin between 12% and 13%. Looking at the second half, we continue to expect an additional $20 million to $30 million in incremental media spend when compared with the second half of last year.","Interest and other related expense is expected to be $120 million, which includes $15 million in prepayment expense to retire the remaining $250 million of 8% senior notes. This expense is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. The full year tax rate is expected to be in the teens.","We increased our EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.65, from our previous range of $3.25 to $3.40. The increase is driven by our year-to-date performance, which was ahead of our expectations, as well as the slightly improved outlook for the second half.","With respect to our cash flow guidance, we now expect to generate $450 million to $550 million in free cash flow, up from our prior range of $350 million to $450 million. This includes expected pension contributions of approximately $38 million and net capital expenditures of approximately $50 million.","Now turning to our debt. Assuming the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance of $500 million, we plan to use $250 million to pay off the remainder of our 8% senior notes and $60 million to pay dividends, leaving us around $200 million to help pay for the Maidenform acquisition. So we should exit the year with long-term debt of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, implying a long-term debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2 1\/4 times, excluding any earnings impact from Maidenform.","Going forward, we'll no longer talk about specific debt targets, rather we'll focus on where we are in relation to our targeted long-term debt-to-EBITDA range of 1.5x to 2.5x.","In closing, a strong first half results could put us in a great position to be able to raise guidance midway through the year, and we're thrilled to be tracking ahead of schedule in achieving our target margin goal of 12% to 14%. As the financial impact from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and acquisition synergies drive higher levels of sustainable free cash flow, we see a significant amount of opportunity to create further shareholder value for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the second quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to focus on the top line, though, obviously. It know it sounds like there's some currency going on in there and the Innovate-to-Elevate strategy's really working. Can you help us bridge the gap, when you've got all these great new products and platforms coming to the marketplace and how we should kind of bridge that gap to where the sales trends are and think about an algorithm on the sales line longer-term, maybe there's a little bit more low- to mid-single digits, as opposed to what looks like from the pretty low single digits this year?","Richard A. Noll","Sure. So I'll just take you back to our long-term organic growth trend is 2% to 4%, my personal goal is 3% or 4%. We're sort of right in and around there with one sort of -- from an overall standpoint, with the exception that currency, obviously, is weighing in on our business, which I think is a little bit of a surprise given how small International is as a part of our mix. It's unfortunate that a lot of our International business is focused on areas that have rapidly depreciating currencies. And so that's not going to, I think, knock a full point of growth off of our top line. And I think the other anomaly is what we saw in the first quarter, right, which is just sort of overall soft retail environment that's sort of working its way through our shipments first in Q1 in Basics and then in Q2. So when you correct that out, we feel pretty good about our overall trend given that it's a relatively choppy retail environment. So you're talking about a couple of points of growth, excluding currency, back half's probably about 2.5% and that's in our long-term organic growth range.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Are there any specific brands, Rich, or lines or categories that may be are a little bit more disappointing than others, where you think you can internally drive some improvement?","Gerald W. Evans","This is Gerald, just to follow up on that. No, I would say in general, we saw a good -- we're seeing good performance. Our innovations are all performing very well. Certainly, the adjustment in Intimates came this quarter while we felt the adjustment in inventory last quarter in Basics. It came early in the quarter and we certainly saw the inventories rationalize. And we think we're well positioned now moving forward.","Richard A. Noll","And I think it's also important to say, inherent in our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, which is to drive innovation, to leverage our strong brands and help us and our retailers drive average unit ring up, I think it's critical to understand, that's not all about driving units at any price, it is about quality of earnings and going after segments of the market or subsegments of the market that are willing to pay more for innovation where you can ultimately make more money. So we're as much focused, if not more focused, on that operating profit increase as we are in just raw units on driving the top line.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eric Tracy with G&A Capital Market.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, if I could follow-up on that, Rich and\/or Gerald, just in terms of the units moving higher with these new platforms, I mean, talk us through how we should think about the mixing up from a pricing perspective on a go-forward basis. You've got X-TEMP getting layered in. Obviously, scaling of ComfortBlend and Smart Size, just how should we start to think about kind of the unit versus pricing algorithm? Obviously, now relatively stabilized cotton environment right now, but how should we think about that going forward?","Richard A. Noll","I think what's really important is for us to sort of just pull back and make sure that you understand how we focus and it's on driving the top line in dollars within our range, as well as then driving our margins to get to the levels that we think is critical. And while units is obviously on top of our mind, it's not the first and foremost thing on our mind. In our category, these are relatively stable, especially in Innerwear. We've talked about how the pairs purchased per person per year has been relevant -- relatively stable for well over a decade. But the secret is if you've got a great product like X-TEMP, where somebody's willing to pay 30%, or in that case 50% more than the regular stuff, you're going to drive -- you're going to make that consumer happy. You're going to drive improvements for our retailer and you'll ultimately been allow us to make a little bit more money. And that's sort of the overall business model. The bits and pieces of it, I don't want to try and get into, it's really an integrated strategy, to drive those -- Innovate-to-Elevate is drive our big brands with innovation and leverage our global supply chain. And all 3 of those things work synergistically to help us improve our margins. When you look at our inherent guidance for the year, I think that's really the story to take away, which this we came into this year thinking of operating margins in that 11% to 12%. We're now sitting here saying they're going to be between 12% and 13% because those 3 components of Innovate-to-Elevate are working synergistically and we feel really good about our results and that's why we're taking our full year guidance up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask just -- you operate in different tiers or price strategy, just curious to see if you saw any kind the difference between mass or department stores or other channels during the quarter?","Richard A. Noll","No, I wouldn't say that we saw a significant difference between channels in the quarter. They generally behave the same and we saw the adjustments in Basics, predominantly in Q1 and Intimates in Q2 and across the channels.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Rich, on the capital allocation theme that I think you've laid out and executed pretty well on, I guess, the next potential piece of the puzzle could be share buybacks. How do we think about that? When can that potentially start to materialize?","Richard A. Noll","I've always talked about uses of free cash flow now in 3 buckets: Dividends, bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases. And I think if -- as I said, if we zoom ahead 5 or 7 years and look back, I think you're going to see a balance between those 3 things. But in any given year, you're not going to see a balance, it's always going to be weighted more heavily one towards the other. On a go-forward basis, we don't really have a strong predisposition between those 3 things, but we have had a clear near-term priority. With the first priority being to institute a dividend. The second opportunity obviously as we talked about last week of being able to take advantage of the Maidenform acquisition. At some point, share buybacks will come in to that mix, I'm firmly convinced of that. Exactly when, it remains to be seen. But I do think over time, you'll see sort of more of a balanced mixture of all of those things.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just last one, if I may. Just looking at your implied guidance, looks lack back -- kind of back of the envelope math, EBIT, you're modeling down about 2% in the back half, but there's an increase in ad spend or marketing spend so I think it's up about mid singles on a 1% type of sales growth gain in the back half of the year adjusted for marketing spend. Does that sound right, Rick?","Richard D. Moss","Yes. The SG&A spend in the back half of the year will be up about $20 million to $30 million, and that's pretty much the marketing spend for the -- the increased marketing spend year-over-year.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So as you anniversary these -- the cotton inflationary benefits from the past year, is that a fair relationship to think about low single digit, rev growth and mid single-digit EBIT growth and then the rest gets made up for vis-a-vis capital allocation. Is that the right way to think about the earnings algorithm here?","Richard A. Noll","I don't think so. I think what's really important is to go back to a slide that Rick talked about on Investor Day. And that was where he showed how our business is relatively when stable on an annualized basis, but is highly volatile within on a quarterly basis. And that's going to be true for a quarter and for 2 quarters. And so we never think of our business on terms of what are those macro trends just driven by what happened in a quarter. For example, we're not taking up the full year guidance because we had a good quarter, nor will we take down the full year guidance if we ever just had 1 bad quarter. We're going to react to what are those major trend changes in our business, what's showing through and what's going to happen on an annualized basis. We have that volatility in the short term, but it all tends to, pun intended, sort of come out in the wash on an annualized basis. So I'd be very cautious to try and extrapolate by a calculation for 1 or 2 quarters to, okay, that's the exact trend that's happening in this business. You need to always look at us on more of an annualized basis.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering, Rich, if you could maybe remind us, I think when you did Gear For Sports, it was accretive in the first year by roughly $0.20. And while it's not specific guidance, you did mention that you think it's reasonable that Maidenform could do, I think $0.10 to $0.15. I was just wondering if you can maybe, just up from a high-level, talk about the differences between the 2 integrations and why you wouldn't think Maidenform could potentially be more accretive given that it's a substantially larger business?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. We feel really good about our long-term guidance that we talked about that Maidenform could add $0.60 to EPS within 3 years when synergies are fully realized. And it is something where you sit there and go, \"Okay, well why don't we expect $0.20 in the first year, grow on to $0.40 and then to $0.60. But at this time, remember, I don't think that would be actually very prudent. Remember, they're going through a trend change with some of their business. We've got to get in there. They're already repositioning some of it. We'll need to reposition a little bit. And given that we haven't fully gotten in and fully developed our integration plans, I think it makes a lot of sense to keep our eye on making sure we deliver that $0.60 as quickly as possible, but let's be mindful of what we don't know in the near term and not get overly bullish and then disappoint ourselves based on what we are absolutely convinced is a great long-term deal. Over the next couple of quarters, we'll have more and more information, as we talked about, we'll have more information on third quarter call. And then finally, on our fourth quarter call, when we give full-blown 2014 guidance, we'll be able to bridge all that for you.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if I -- you kind of highlighted it, you hit up on, on it a little bit, but they do, Maidenform, if I recall correctly, had a lot of innovation that they were launching in the back half of this year. I think they were making entry into full figure bras with the Maidenform brand and there was further innovation going on next year, which I think bodes very well with your Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. I was just wondering if you could talk about that potentially? Is that still on track? Are you still going to launch those products? And within that specifically dialing in on the intimate category, I know there was a little bit of weakness this quarter. Could we potentially see an acceleration from what you say are now more stabilized trends for intimate apparel, bras, panties, given this innovation?","Richard A. Noll","That's pretty easy to answer because it's only been a week since we announced the acquisition so -- and we only have a deal. So right now, we are still competitors. We have to operate at such. We're 2 independent companies. And until close, that will be the case, so we're not involved or will we be involved in any part of what their launch plans are or what their plans are with retail until after the close of the business. So that's all yet to come and be developed and so we've got to take it a step at a time. Pretty soon, we'll be taking the next step, which is filing the antitrust thing. They'll be filing the proxy after that. Once we have closure, we'll be able to give you a lot more line of sight to exactly what those plans are. In terms of the other question, which is sort of macro what's going on with intimate apparel, I think at the end of the day, we've talked, since the great recession, that, that category has never fully recovered, as we've seen some of the men's and other categories in even women's apparel. Intimate apparel's sort of been gone through its ebbs and flows since the recession. We don't anticipate that changing. What I do think we'll be able to do is we'll have a broader platform to drive our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and that will be a good thing for both consumers and retailers, and obviously, our strong financial perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Another great quarter from the Innerwear margins. Within the Innerwear margins, can you speak to the variance you're seeing between the socks and underwear versus the intimates? And then in the context of the long-term 12% to 14% EBIT margin objective, where do you expect the underwear margins to settle?","Richard D. Moss","Well, I don't want to get into the specifics on any of those individual lines other than to say that we're doing very well in all of them. We're making money in all of those lines and feel very good about the margin improvement in those lines.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of where it would settle out long term, I think that, that business is always going to be inherently -- have higher profit characteristics than Activewear, as we've talked about over time just because of the replenishment nature. What I'm really thrilled about is, as we've now started to graft Innovate-to-Elevate onto Activewear, we've made huge strides in getting that segment into double digits. And I think that a lot of credit goes to Gerald and that team in getting us there, so we feel really good about how we're able to translate that strategy into a broader set of our segments. And that's where you're seeing a lot of improvement as well.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So, Rich, if we look at these Innerwear margins in the low-20s as being a femoral or is that something you see as sustainable over the long term and some of the other categories, just closed the gap with that?","Richard A. Noll","And this is where -- I'm going to go back to my comment about -- given the fact that our business, our total business can be fairly volatile in a given quarter, clearly within a segment, you can see things sort of fluctuate up-and-down and I'd be cautious to not extrapolate what you see in a quarter or 2, especially within a segment, as okay, that's the new long-term trend. You want to look at our business always on an annualized basis, rolling 4 quarter basis and that will give you a little bit more insight into sort of what those trends are. So that's -- I think that's enough to say about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Rick, I was actually just going to follow-up on our discussion, again, about the Innovate-to-Elevate, how it's mixing up with the price. Just in the broader scheme of the long-term operating margin target of that 12% to 14%, clearly going to be in that range this year. Between the Activewear business improving profitability, the scaling up and supply chain of the core and then ultimately layering in and integrating Maidenform, it seems like that number might prove to be conservative. I know you want to set an appropriate bar, but, again, how do we just think about that longer term?","Richard D. Moss","Yes. Well, Eric, I've always said that -- because I've been asked this question multiple times and I've always said, hey, I'll address whether or not 12% to 14% is the right goals for us once we hit it. And I guess we just said that we've hit it, so you're asking, right? So that's fair. I think that, one, we're thrilled that we're hitting it this quickly and it's a little bit earlier than we anticipated. I would have expected it, I think originally, we would\u2019ve projected it at being next year. And so that speaks to the strength of our brands, our innovations are working and I don't want us to forget the great global supply chain that helps us keep our cost low. In terms of where we can go from there, I think we do need to step back and think about it from a long-term perspective, start to think through what integration of Maidenform means and then probably reset that bar. I don't want to do it today, the good thing is we're sort of on the lower end of that range and so we've got a lot of potential to move up towards the higher end of the range and clearly that should be a goal. Whether -- where we can go from there, give us a little bit of time to think it through and try and reset that goal appropriately and thoughtfully.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could, just one more, in terms of free cash getting bumped up here another $100 million, is that fair to sort of think about on a go-forward basis annually in that $450 million to $550 million, maybe for you, Rick. And secondly for Rich, just in terms of allocation beyond sort of the buyback dividend and\/or acquisitions. And thinking about maybe the CapEx investments that need to be made at International in developing that organic growth because, again, I think it...","Richard D. Moss","First of all, on the growth for this year, it's driven by, a, the increased profitability that we now expect versus our original guidance. And, b, an improved outlook on our part on where our working capital management is going to go for this year. In terms of longer term, we've always said that as time goes on and profitability increases, that \"normalized\" $400 million would increase. We've said that we expect to generate by year 3, $65 million of free cash flow via Maidenform. So, yes, it will continue to go up over time.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of CapEx, both internationally or if Maidenform's going to have any additional CapEx, we've always talked about -- we've just gone through a few years ago recapitalizing the supply chain so we could actually cut capital a little bit. But then over a couple of years by starting in '14 and '15, that's going to start to move back towards depreciation and amortization. I think that's the right level for us long term to stay competitive and invest in our business and invest for growth. So I don't see any major change from that perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Krasik with BB&T.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Rich, it seems like you turned the corner on International and for a while, you were focusing on domestic because there were just headwinds and macro issues. So is this now more of a sustainably growing business x currency? And now what's the outlook towards both organic growth internationally longer term and potential acquisitions?","Gerald W. Evans","Scott, this is Gerald. Let me address the first part of your question first. Certainly, International had a very solid quarter on a constant currency basis, up 5%. And we are making good progress in executing our regionalization strategy that we laid out. I think the best indication of that is we first focused in Canada. We had very strong results in Canada in the double-digit range. So we feel good about the progress there. As we look forward, yes, we do think we're seeing that on a constant currency basis will be through the back half of this year and the mid- to -- or the low- to mid-single-digit rate and we feel like we have some momentum back in that. Of course we've got to overcome the headwind of currency, but that will pass in time and we think we've got some momentum there.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of long term from an acquisitions standpoint, I've always said that acquisitions that fit in our criteria: Core category, cost synergies, complementary growth synergies and great returns for shareholders. We've never said that geography is off limits. In fact, one of the complementary growth opportunities would be a geographic expansion, somewhere in our core categories. I've used examples of how we may have a strong Men's Underwear business in 1 market and doing a small Intimate apparel acquisition to build critical mass could make sense. So clearly, that can be part of our long-term strategy and it's something that's clearly in our minds.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Maidenform, it's been 5 more days. Maybe you can touch on the selling side. I mean, you're constantly sort of talking down what you're going to have to rationalize, but what are the opportunities to innovate and elevate Maidenform?","Richard A. Noll","I think they've got -- it's only been 5 days, so we really haven't made much progress. And to be honest, we went from that to actually focusing on getting ready for this call. And so we haven't really made any progress. I'll just reiterate what I said last week, which is they've got great brands. It's why it's an attractive acquisition for us. We think they've got a lot of great things that as we grafted on to our overall, more disciplined Innovate-to-Elevate program, leveraging our supply chain, innovation they do and innovation we do and our collective strong brands, we can have complementary growth opportunities and I think more than that would be premature. We'll talk more about it over time, as we develop more specifics.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Burns with D.A. Davidson.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","My question is on the Activewear margins. You had phenomenal improvement in the first half with cotton being the largest driver. Can you provide some color on the non-cotton drivers, such as innovation, mix, in-sourcing of non-cotton programs? What are you benefiting from right now in those terms and where is the bulk of the margin opportunity going forward?","Gerald W. Evans","Sure, Andrew. As you've laid out or asked the question, there's certainly 2 elements to that. One, first was deemphasizing the commodity portions of our printwear business, which we have certainly done. But a large part of the growth in this quarter and as we go forward is coming from really executing our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy against that branded Activewear business that we're focused on. It's leveraging our strong brands both the Champion brand, the C9 brand and the Hanes brand bringing in innovations. We introduced our Vapor products, as well as some new sports bras in the quarter and then, of course, internalizing production into our supply chain. All of which we're doing, all of which is driving that margin improvement. And we expect to continue to hold that sort of double-digit operating margin on an ongoing basis now. So it really is that model coming together. And I should add into that the acquisition of gear gave us a nice platform as well to further enhance margins and build our brand and position in the business. So we feel real good about where that business is going. We've got nice momentum and we think we can certainly continue to see that going forward.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And one quick question, just in terms of Maidenform. In your initial guidance, there was the expectation of for more than $500 million in revenue, that those are year 3 numbers. As we think about our 2014 in building out that initial EPS relative to, I think consensus is for '13 for Maidenform is $580 million, should we be thinking that there'll be the quick exit of some programs so that we should be thinking about a number closer to $500 million in 2014? Or is it going to take perhaps a couple of years to get there, if it indeed ever gets there?","Richard A. Noll","So since we don't have the exact plans yet, I can't answer you specifically, but I can tell you philosophically how we'd want to approach things. And that is -- and remember, they've already started some of their trend change and sort of retrenching and pulling back on some of their areas. But if you're going to do something, you want to do it fast. You want to get it behind you as quickly as possible rather than trying to spill it out over a large number of years. I don't think it's going to be a huge amount of change. We've talked about probably about 10% of the revenue as a good way of thinking of what we use to sort of the long-term model. But it's not something we're going to peel out over slowly over many, many years. It's something you'll more than likely would go in and do and try and do pretty quickly. But it's stuff on the margin. That said, we don't have any plans yet. We've got to get in there, we're going to understand exactly what we need to do and then as time goes on, we'll give you more line of sight, as we know our specific plans.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eric Beder with Brean Capital.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Could you talk about the rollout of Platinum in Macy's and how that's doing? And how should we think about next year in terms of paying down the debt from the Maidenform deal? A, what interest rates should we think about? And how quickly can you do it? Given all that you have, it might feel that it sounds like you can build maybe a little bit quicker than the 1.5 years that you talked about originally?","Gerald W. Evans","This is Gerald. Let me address the Macy's part of the question first and then I'll turn it over for the second half. The Hanes program at Macy's really didn't place at retail until late June, so it's a little early to read the results there. What I can tell you though is that they began selling the product online earlier and it's performed quite well there. And I think, certainly, we see positive results. Macy's is very excited about the launch and we have every reason to believe this program is going to be a big success. And I think it does show once again the ability of Hanes brand to span all those classes at trade. It's truly unique and a testament to the brand's strength.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of the overall cash flow, debt paydown and then the interest expense for debt, I just want to remind you, first, I'll turn it over to Rick, but remind you that remember, our cash flow generation is somewhat lumpy. We're usually using cash in the first quarter first half and generating cash in the back half. So when you think about it, we've sort of think of it almost as sort of year chunks or 6 months chunks and so -- but with that, Rick, you want to answer that specifically?","Richard D. Moss","No, Richard, you're exactly right. Keep in mind that we did increase the size of our revolver last week to $1.1 billion and got a pricing decrease as a result of that. So we'll be funding the Maidenform transaction from free cash flow, as we talked about a little earlier and from revolver outstandings, which will be 2% or slightly less in terms of the effective interest rate on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan.","Paul Simenauer","This is Paul Simenauer on the line for Carla Casella. I just have a few questions. First, what was the cotton benefit in this quarter? And what does the gross margin comparison versus last year look like in the back half?","Richard A. Noll","In terms of cotton, last year, in the second quarter, our average cotton cost was $1.84. This year, it's $0.93 a pound. In terms of comparisons to the back -- in terms of the back half, as we talked about, we believe that the second quarter will be our highest quarter in terms of gross profit margin, primarily because this is Innerwear's -- really their strongest sales quarter and they obviously have the highest margins in the business. As we move through Q3 and 4, you'll see Activewear as a percentage of sales go up and that will have -- that will average the gross margin rate down albeit higher than last year. So we will continue to see year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margins through the balance of this year.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.

These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC such as our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and may be found on our website and in our news releases and other communications. The company does not update -- undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements which speak only to the time at which they are made.","Please also note, in May 2012, Hanesbrands announced exiting certain International and Domestic imagewear businesses that are now classified as discontinued operations and as noted in today\u2019s press release, additional information can be found in our 10-Q\u2019s and in the Investors section of our hanesbrands.com website. Unless otherwise noted, today\u2019s speakers will be discussing our performance from our continuing operations.","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Nictakis, one of our two Co-Chief Operating Officer\u2019s; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. For today\u2019s call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Bill will provide a sense of what is happening in a few of our businesses and Rick will emphasize us some of the financial aspects of our results.","I\u2019ll now like to turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thank you, Charlie. We had a very good quarter with EPS of $1.11, operating margins of 12.8% and free cash flow of $287 million, with all three being at the highest levels in our history.","Sales grew 3% with notable strength in panties which were up mid-single digits, male underwear up nearly double digits and activewear up mid-teens. We also had a great back-to-school at mass, although it was diluted somewhat by softness at mid-tier.","From an operating profits standpoint, Innerwear, direct-to-consumer and International, all grew double digits versus prior year and Outerwear\u2019s profit performance improve sequentially as we cycled through the last of a very high cost cotton.","Gross margins improved as expected and we continue to see substantial SG&A cost savings from efficiency initiatives and distribution.","Lastly, free cash flow was truly exceptional and we\u2019ve already completed our 2012 goal of paying down $300 million of debt.","We not only delivered a great third quarter but I\u2019m also encouraged about the earnings momentum we carry into the fourth quarter and beyond. As we look to Q4, we expect sales growth to sequentially improve, operating margins to expand to another record of over 13%, EPS to exceed a dollar, and free cash flow of another $200 plus million. It is great to finally have the cotton bubble behind us.","Our margin momentum is strong fueled in part by cotton becoming a tailwind but also from the continued benefits of our optimization initiatives that are reducing both supply chain and SG&A cost.","And additionally, as Bill will further detail, our innovate to elevate strategy is beginning to help us new products, such as ComfortBlend, slim fit underwear and Smart Size bras are driving both higher sales and margins, as well as leading to shelf space gains for 2013.","Lastly, free cash flow should continue to build and we expect to exit the year with substantial cash flow in our balance sheet positioning us well to prepay another $500 million of bonds in 2013.","So to wrap up, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter results. Our organization is executing well. Our brands are strong. Our new products are working. And I\u2019m excited about what I see in our innovation pipeline. I\u2019m always watchful of the macro-economic environment. Our current momentum will certainly help us finalize specific plans to achieve 2013 EPS in the low $3 range.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Nictakis","Thanks, Rich. Our core categories continued to strengthen and performed well in the third quarter. We are consumer driven company and our consistent focus against the consumer is paying off.","Our emphasis on delivering best-in-class product quality, developing meaningful value-added innovations and continuing to build our strong brands is working to meet consumer needs. This is evidence not only by the share gains we\u2019re seeing in many of our core categories, but more importantly by the additional space gains our retailers are awarding us for 2013.","Before I talk about specific business performance, I want to talk about how we focus against the consumer, both with our leading brands and our approach to consumer innovation, specifically our ongoing innovate to elevate initiative, designed to drive value-added, higher priced and higher margin items for both us and our retail partners.","While the cotton inflation we experienced over the past 18 months, post some unique challenges. It enabled our core categories to burst through some of the mythical price barriers. In all this timeframe, our retailers came to learn what we knew, that consumers are willing to trade up and pay more for better brands and better products.","This shift in mindset has enabled us to pursue enhancements that are superior to current offerings and that commend a higher price. And we found that we combine innovation with our strong brand equity, consumers really respond favorably and we\u2019re able to grow both our business and that of our retailers.","We have already seen multiple successes with our innovate to elevate strategy. Hanes ComfortBlend underwear has been a tremendous new product success that\u2019s driven share gain for our business and delivered significant growth for our retailers, even though has a premium price. Our Smart Size bra introductions on our Bali and Barely There brands have been widely acclaimed successes, as has our C9 by Champion premium yoga pant.","Again, because these products meet consumer needs in an innovative and elevated way. And we have more new products starting to enter the market, such as our Champion No Show line of Sports Bras and our Hanes slim fit and stretch T-shirts.","Our retailers recognize the power of this innovate to elevate strategy and are rewarding us with shelf space gains for 2013 across many of our core categories. We\u2019ll share more specifics around this strategy during our February Investor Day event.","Now I know another question you have is, what we are seeing from a macro-retail perspective? We really have not seen a significant trend change throughout this year, with good months and some not so good months. Because one pattern we are noticing it\u2019s the performance of brand. Those retailers that are focusing on national brand seem overall to be growing faster than those that are emphasizing their own brands.","Let me now shift the highlights from our third quarter and let\u2019s start with Innerwear, where sales grew 3%, the third quarter of sequential improvement. Our male underwear and panties categories were strong, but raw sales were down in the quarter.","While our new products are performing well ahead of plan, gross overall performance was diluted by softness at J. C. Penney. In fact, Penney was responsible for the entire decline in bras and reduced total Innerwear segment growth by 2 points in the quarter.","Now I know many of you will have questions regarding pricing, given the declining cost of cotton? So let me address that now.","Our wholesale pricing has been implemented is already in the market and a set for the balance of 2012 and 2013. And we are seeing the retail price gaps in our major categories revert to historical norms.","So that issue is behind us and we are now focus on working with our retailers to determine how to best leverage our innovation and brands to drive their categories, sales and profitability.","Looking at Innerwear profitability, we are pleased with the 10% increase in operating profit in the quarter. Gross margins continue to improve versus second quarter as lower cotton cost began to work through the supply chain and this improvement should continue into Q4.","Let\u2019s now shift to International, the one area that is consistently performed below our expectations this year, due to a combination of both external and internal factors. Clearly, there have been some macro issues in certain countries, overseeing economic growth slow substantially.","With that said, there is some executional issues that we\u2019ve identified and that we\u2019re now beginning to address. In the near-term, we do expect a lag behind our goal for double-digit growth for International overall. But remain positive about the long-term prospects for growth in our core international geographies in the Americas and Asia.","Now to our Domestic business and turning to Outerwear, sales were up 5%, driven by mid-teens growth in activewear and high single-digit growth from Gear for Sports. Champion continues to grow with Sports Bras and other performance products leading the way.","With regards to profit, the Outerwear segments suffered the most from the high cost of cotton. With cotton costs declining for the balance of the year and the positive strength of our order book, we anticipate improvement in Outerwear gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter versus last year.","Our final segment is direct-to-consumer, where sales grew 2% and operating profit was up 18% in the quarter. This group has done a nice job of focusing on profitable sales with year-to-date profits improving 13%.","To wrap up, I\u2019m happy with our team\u2019s performance in the third quarter. We\u2019ve accomplished a great deal in the midst of a very challenging environment, in large part because we continue to focus on the consumer.","Our brands remain the clear consumer favorites. We have a proven innovate to elevate process that\u2019s delivering strong results for both us and our retail partners, and we are on track to gain additional shelf space to support those innovations in 2013.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick Moss to discuss our financial performance.","Rick Moss","Thanks, Bill. As both, Rich and Bill mentioned, our team executed extremely well in the third quarter, as we exhibited continue sequential improvement in sales, margin and EPS. Sales in the third quarter were $1.22 billion, up 3% versus last year and earnings per share were $1.11, up 31% from last year. Stronger U.S. dollar has negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by about $7 million or 0.5 point of growth.","Gross margins for the quarter came in at 32.8%, slightly better than our expectations. Gross margins were down about 200 basis points or $14 million from last year\u2019s third quarter, primarily due to cotton costs that were 37% higher than prior year from $0.97 last year to $1.33 per pound this year. Supply chain savings for the quarter were $13 million and stand at $31 million for the year and ahead of our plans.","SG&A continued to perform better than our expectations, driven not only by planned lower media spending, but also by lower distribution in other selling expenses. SG&A decreased $26 million from the prior year period and improved 270 basis points year-over-year to 20% of sales.","Operating profit in the quarter increased 8% or $12 million versus last year, with double-digit increases in three of our four reporting segments. Our operating margin of 12.8% is the highest in our company\u2019s history.","Outerwear, which was impacted the most by higher cotton costs swung from an operating loss in the second quarter to an operating profit of $46 million and an operating margin of 11% in the third quarter. As expected, interest expense for the quarter declined about $5 million and our tax rate was 8%.","Moving to the balance sheet, our focus on working capital improvement and cash generation was evident in the quarter with inventory down $267 million from the end of last year, as we saw declines in both input costs and units. Free cash flow is very strong at $287 million for the quarter. And we expect a strong fourth quarter of cash generation as well.","Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re expecting sales of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion, and earnings per share of a $1 to $1.06. Gross margin should be in the mid 30s with operating margins slightly above 13%.","Interest expense should be about $33 million and we expect the tax rate to be in the mid-teens. This should result in full year sales of approximately $4.52 billion in EPS, $2.54 to $2.50 with the lower end of EPS, now $0.04 sends above our primary guidance. ","We now expect free cash flow of approximately $500 million for the year. Of about 80% of that generated in the U.S. This guidance is at the upper end of our previous range and includes pension contributions of $30 million and lastly $45 million of capital expenditures.","Last week, we complete $300 remaining long-term debt repayment. We should end the year with substantially cash on the balance sheet and have a nice head start on the $500 million needed to pre-pay the 8% fixed rate notes in 2013. As Rich mentioned, we continue to see 2013 EPS potentially in the low $3 range.","All in all, I\u2019m pleased with our results in the third quarter and year-to-date. We\u2019ve successfully navigated the cotton bubble. Improved sales and margins throughout the year and are exceeding the free cash flow expectations we set. We\u2019re executing well and look to continue this as we move into 2013 and beyond.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Charlie.","Charlie Stack","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the third quarter. Before we take your questions today, I\u2019d like to follow up on Bill\u2019s comment regarding your upcoming investor day.","We\u2019re currently planning to host an Investor Day at our headquarters in late February and hope you would join us. Look for more information to come as we finalize the details over the next couple of months.","Now, we begin taking your questions and we will continue as time allows. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question. I\u2019ll ask that you limit your questions to one question plus a follow-up and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back to the operator to begin the question-and-answer Session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Hey guys, good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks Eric.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","So Rich, I guess, if we could may be talk a little bit about the macro and certainly some of the uncertainty out there as we head into holiday season. What you\u2019re seeing from retailers, how they are thinking about their order books. How they planning from a pricing perspective, obviously, you guys have that locked in.","But just may be a little bit of color as we transition from what was a Decent 3Q. You expect sales to continue to accelerate in 4Q. May be just provide a little bit of a color on that backdrop?","Rich Moss","Yeah. So let me just do some of the overall macro consumer stuff and then turn it over to Bill for some of the specific about our holiday. In terms of the overall environment, we haven\u2019t seen a major trend change since the recession. There are some good months followed by some bad months when you look at the overall retailer sell-through data and but fortunately the overall trend has been slightly positive. No real change to that.","One thing we are seeing is mass is actually being little bit stronger, the mass here in department stores, that seems to be a trend change although I would necessarily says it\u2019s a macro consumer trend change. You do have some issues with some mid tier accounts that are just faced with their own technical issues and that may just really be the things that\u2019s driving that.","So overall, in this environment, we\u2019re very watchful but we haven\u2019t actually noted anything other than trends we\u2019ve seen sort of business as usual. In terms of all portfolio, we do expect sequential improvement in sales growth for the fourth quarter. And Bill, do you want to talk about the promotion and pricing and how well set we are?","Bill Nictakis","Sure. For the holiday, we\u2019re set. I mean the promotions are locked with all of our retailers and our innovations been working. It\u2019s going to continue to work. Our promotional offers and consumer events are locked and we\u2019re preparing to service them in a great fashion like we\u2019ve been servicing them all year.","So I think we are poised for a strong holiday. The key is going to be traffic in terms of how people walk into the stores and I think we\u2019ll all know more about that in a couple of months but they walk in the stores. I think they\u2019re going to have a lot of innovation, a lot of great brands and some real good service, which has to borrow products.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. I guess, the follow-up to that, sales seem to be holding a decent visibility there. You\u2019ve now turned the corner on cotton and some really nice tailwind cyclically and I think structurally on margin, consumer gross margin perspective. Rich, I mean, how do you think about investing from a G&A perspective behind marketing dollars to support continued sales based gains in gaining more traction with your retail partners. Both from a 4Q perspective and then as we sort of go into next year?","Rich Noll","Yeah. Clearly, I\u2019ve talked about that before that we did cut media back, for example, this year to navigate some of the issues we had with the cotton inflation and our intent is to restore that in 2013 in terms of tens of millions of dollars. And I\u2019ve also talked about if we\u2019ve got some upside this year, we\u2019ll actually begin that process this year.","In fact, I think our total media spent for the euro be up a couple million more than what we originally plan going into the year. And as the fourth quarter unfolds if we see opportunities where we\u2019ve got some strength to continue to invest behind driving results into 2013, we\u2019ll do that but we\u2019ll clearly be doing it in 2013 and that\u2019s already built into what Rick was talking about as our potential earnings per share for 2013.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, guys. Hey guys, I appreciate it. Best of luck.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Rich Noll","Hello, Omar.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Yeah. Can you hear me?","Rich Noll","Yeah, now.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. How are you?","Rich Noll","Great.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Wanted to follow-up on Bill\u2019s discussion of the retail price gaps, can you talk about reverting the more historical normalization there. Can you talk about where you\u2019ve seen those price gaps at the largest, were they coming for the business and what exactly, how bigger these price gaps that are narrowing?","Bill Nictakis","Let me tackle the subject of pricing and let me put it into context. Our number one priority is to ensure that we\u2019re investing against their consumer. I mean, that\u2019s really the life color of our business. Our first and foremost priority is to make sure that we\u2019re making a proper investments against our great brands, ensure we have terrific product quality and that we continue to prime innovation pump.","And we have to ensure that we have the proper pricing in place to do that and to make sure we\u2019re delivering the proper value to the consumer. We have that pricing right now. I think into our businesses I said the prices are in place and set for the balance of this year and next year. And our customers, I think overall are pleased with how we\u2019re managing the business. We\u2019re growing our sales, growing our profitability, growing the productivity of the space and the best evidence of that is the fact they\u2019re rewarding us with some more space gains for next year.","The gaps seem to be moving back towards historical levels. I can speak to what your competitors are doing or not doing but the retailer has set the prices and our focus is working with them to drive the consumer into the stores, drive the AUR and that\u2019s going up.","Rich Noll","Yeah. And I think you see historically our gaps have been between 5% and 10% versus the number two brand for example in underwear category or socks. And we\u2019re in that range now. Last year at Christmas, those gaps had widened substantially if you remember that we were the -- being the number one brand, we led the price increases and you saw gaps in the order of 20%, 25% that we had at retail.","Now, they are back to that normal historical 5% to 10%. You can see things change from day in and day out as different promotions go in and out but that\u2019s where they seem to have settled out.","To be frank, when they are below that 5% level, the retailers actually start to work towards, saying wait a minute we didn\u2019t get more for Hanes or if competitors are actually below that. They have a tendency and we\u2019ve seen this and did this in past, where they raise those retails to maintain at 5% to 10% GAAP and that\u2019s ideal.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Great. Thanks and then on the factory side, as you guys took some down time this year, can you just give us an update on where you\u2019re standing in terms of the capacity and overhead absorption? Are you running at full capacity? Do you see any need? You know as you look at, given your outlook for the business and revenue side of it to enact some of those measures in the future, what did you learn from that whole experience in terms of having to take down time. Thanks?","Rich Noll","Yeah. So in terms of overall capacity and down time, if we remember when we entered this year, we had two challenges. One we had to restructure overall supply chain to deal with exiting the discontinued ops, the imagewear businesses, private label pieces and so on. So we had to restructure that. We also wanted to take some short time to make sure we\u2019re beginning to bleed off inventories, both of those things we accomplish when we feel real good about where we are.","In Q4, there is a lot of seasonal down time, Christmas holidays and other things as well as regularly scheduled down time, it will take but that\u2019s all built into our guidance. When we entered the year, Rick, I think we\u2019re talking about $20 million.","Rick Moss","$20 million for all those actions.","Rich Noll","\u2026and how much we spent.","Rick Moss","We spent through the third quarter about $19 million.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Got it. And then quick comment, we saw the news of this target C9 store. It\u2019s a test location obviously targeted to a great retailer. What is the store, how is it positioned to the consumer and are there any expansion plans?","Rich Noll","Yeah. What, I think you\u2019ll have to ask the target teams in terms of their expansion plans on that. I mean clearly, we love the fact that they are showcasing our C9 by Champion brand, and we are continuing to help them drive that category, is performing very well for them. And we hope that they add more of those stores.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Anderson from Citi. Your line is open.","Susan Anderson - Citi","Good evening, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Susan.","Susan Anderson - Citi","I guess I wanted to drill down little bit on the guidance and maybe the different moving parts, I guess starting with topline first. Like why the lower topline, particularly since it seems like the third quarter was in line and then sequentially better in the fourth quarter?","And then for earnings, raising it to the top end was great but, why not raise it further and also particularly, since it seems like the tax rate coming in a little bit lower?","Rich Noll","Now, let me give you sort of big picture on it and then I will turn it over to Rick for some more of the specifics. Overall, we are forecasting, if you look at your sales growth for the fourth quarter, the midpoint is about 4% to 5% growth, the top end of the sales ranges about 6%.","And we\u2019ve got a wide range there because you never know, how retailers are going to act -- react in terms of pulling down their inventory, whether it\u2019s going to be in that December timeframe, which we saw last year or normally as they do in January, which would be in 2013.","So we widened the range a little bit. When we came into the year, we were forecasting sales growth of 2% to 4%, but however as sort of the year played out, pennies was actually a big drive on that topline and we\u2019ve already talk about International underperforming a little bit. When you add those two things up, we sort of flow through the lower end of our sales range rather than the high end.","In terms of some of the specifics, Rick, I will turn it over to you.","Rick Moss","Yeah. If you look at, as Rich said, if you look at the quarter from a top-down, we -- as a result of J. C. Penney and the fact that our International business isn\u2019t delivering the growth that we had originally expected, we\u2019ve adjusted our sales guidance accordingly.","I would say this and we\u2019ve been cautious all year along, and I think in an uncertain environment that it continues to be that way. But when we kind of, maybe contrast Q4 and Q3 for you a little bit, Susan, they may give you a little bit of insight into the guidance.","Our operating margins are going to be higher in Q4 than in Q3 is our expectation. But sales will be lower from Q3 to Q4 and that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s normal seasonality of our business. So you have higher margins and a little bit lower sales versus Q3.","At the same time, our tax rate will go to the mid-teens versus 8% in Q3. So those dynamics would drive us to an EPS number of about a $1 to $1.06. Again, for our cash flow, we do expect to be at the top end of the range at about $500 million.","Susan Anderson - Citi","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess a follow-on on that. From your perspective, how is inventory or retail right now from what could tell, like you said last year we have that destocking in December? Is there anything right now that you think would cause that to happen again at this point in the fourth quarter?","Bill Nictakis","Yeah. I think, reaching our inventory levels seem to be in line overall. They are not over inventoried, they are not under inventoried. And as Rich said, they ultimately will adjust to inventory levels coming out of the holidays whether they do it in December or do they do it in January.","Last year was a dramatic reduction in our inventories in December, that was the second biggest we\u2019ve seen in two decades. So the guidance that Rick talked about, as soon as they are gong to be some of the normal reduction in retail inventories, does not assume it go to the huge levels we saw last year. But we expect them to pull down a little bit, because that\u2019s typically what they do.","Rich Noll","Yeah. And actually that\u2019s a good point because that\u2019s probably a little bit of a change from when we were originally talking that we assume that there wouldn\u2019t be any destocking in the fourth quarter, we actually do have a little bit built into that guidance. Not a major change but it is a small change, and I don\u2019t want to miss that point.","Susan Anderson - Citi","Okay. Got it. And then one last question on the pricing and units. In the quarter, maybe if you are able to give some color on that in terms of the driver of the total sales growth? For instance, where price is still up year-over-year and then units down or how should I think about that?","Rich Noll","Yeah. I think when we went into this big double-digit price increase, we wanted to start to get away from talking about exactly how units were going to go relative to prices and so on. So, I don\u2019t want to give that specific.","We are now overlapping the price increases as we go into the fourth quarter. We have most of them fully in place last year. And so while there was some price in the third quarter, by the time it gets to the fourth quarter, there\u2019s going to be very little price in those numbers.","Susan Anderson - Citi","Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks a lot, guys.","Rich Noll","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","So question on some comments. During the call, you alluded to new programs for 2013, are you prepared to talk about those in size and scope? And then you also talked about pricing being secured for 2013, what if anything do you see is the risk to that?","Rich Noll","So, I\u2019ll just start. It\u2019s a little early to talk about sizes and scope for 2013 with all these new products. We do have a great innovation pipeline. The ComfortBlend underwear, for example, we can see them back in 2010. We actually ship this year. However, with all of the pricing and changes in all of that stuff, plus and our retailers were focused on getting through the cotton bubble. You are going to see a lot more of this innovation start to launch going in 2013.","We will give more specifics around that on our fourth quarter call in terms of the dollars and sense of it. And it\u2019s our intent on the February Investor Day to profile a lot of these new products and actually talk about how they\u2019re doing. You will actually be able to see them at retail and so on, so that will need to wait for February. In terms of the other, what was the other part of your question, Jim?","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","Are the pricing into 2013 or any of the risk factors set? I\u2019m surprised that you can, I guess have that locked in for the full year at this juncture, maybe just a little?","Rich Noll","Yeah. Well, certainly they are lot more stable than they were over the last 18 months, that\u2019s for sure. Go ahead.","Rick Moss","I think when you look at the Innerwear business and I will talk about Outerwear. Innerwear is done. The prices are in the marketplace. Today, those were the prices that we expect to continue into \u201813, throughout \u201813. And then again the conversation with our customers has been our strategy of innovation, brand building, quality and price is working really well for them.","They are having strong sales growth, strong profit growth, strong productivity growth. So they are pleased with it, and I think that they are just pleased. On the Outerwear side, we had the first half for the year lock down and again, Outerwear tends to be program-by-program, season-by-season.","So we have great visibility for the first half of the year. All those programs are locked prices. For the second half of the year, about 50% of that business is committed and locked and then the other part of that is still to be, just to be finalized and everything. But that\u2019s sort of where we are and we feel good about it and feel real good about how our innovations work there.","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s great to hear. Thank you, guys.","Rick Moss","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Glick from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you. Good afternoon. Rich, just -- it sounds to me like there is a bit of a change in tone, on the part of the management team toward topline opportunities and you\u2019re coming off a 12 to 18-month period before you had to be a little more defensive in terms of point back marketing, raising prices, managing elasticity, kind of finding the right retails to satisfy demand.","And it sounds like as you go into 2013, you have an opportunity given breaking through some of those price barriers you talked about where you can perhaps be more on the offensive in terms of investing in marketing, perhaps more aggressive with trade and advertising allowances and move more on the offensive, and perhaps continue this trend of improving sales that should carry into 2013. Is that the right way to think about it, maybe a change in mindset going into next year?","Rich Noll","Yeah. And I think I will preface it just a little bit differently. If you remember, we came out of the recession heading into 2010 with 5% growth from shelf space gains. A lot of which was driven by innovation and but you are right, we had to take a pause as we have to deal with the cotton bubble, where all of our attention started to focus on raising prices and it ended up raising prices three times in 12 months, unheard of in our industry prior to that.","And so, but now we are back to that. So, I do think as a total change but we had it there before, we are now going to reemphasis and focus on it a lot more going forward. I do think there is one change in it, though not that -- it\u2019s the first time we are doing innovation.","But I do think the price, changing prices so much proved to both us and our retailers that those artificial price barriers that people had in mind like in some accounts would be $10 and another accounts it was $20. As we had to blow through those because of cotton inflation, it created the license and the opportunity for us to invest even more in better innovation because if everybody started to understand, the consumers willing to pay for it.","And I do think there is sort of an inflection point change there, and so it allows us to bring a lot more innovations to the marketplace than we would\u2019ve even conceived before. And we are going to unveil a lot of that stuff I think you will see it helping us driving into \u201813, but actually even importantly into \u201814 and \u201815 as well.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Great. Thanks. And if I can just ask about the intimates business, I mean we just anniversary a major destocking in that category a year ago and it was a tough business again. It sounds like really more so, on the product side of the business.","If you pull out that what\u2019s going on at J. C. Penney, which I assume is all of your mid-tier commentary. Are you starting to see the business turn in your other accounts and is that obfuscating, maybe a turn in the business?","Rich Noll","Yeah. Look, J. C. Penney was four points of growth in our bra business for the quarter. So it clearly had a significant impact on it. Overall, what we are seeing is our innovation across the whole, smart sizing launch that we\u2019ve done in Bali there in Bali. And Haynes is working exceptionally well, while we are struggling to keep up with demand on that.","So we are seeing that work. We are seeing our panty business, especially in maths performed pretty well for us and consumers responding to renovations. So we are marching on the right path on those, on that business right now.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Okay. Great. Last question for Rick on cash, is the $250 million exiting the year reasonable, the head start you are talking about towards prepaying that $500 million and are you precluded from paying off that $500 million before December?","Rick Moss","Well, keep in mind we said about $500 million we paid off $300 million of the debt, so that would leave about the richer for two, slightly more than $200 million in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s probably, which you\u2019ll see on the balance sheet more or less. In terms of -- but still nice substantial down payment on that number. The call date on those bonds is December 15th of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joan Payson from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Good afternoon. Just in terms of, I guess first off the gross margin drivers and in the last quarter you talked a little bit how that was differentiated by business segment? Maybe if you just give some color on where the Outerwear business came in versus Innerwear on each segment?","Rich Noll","We don\u2019t normally give gross profit by division. We think for competitive reasons that\u2019s by segment, we soon do that. But I can talk a little bit about where we think gross margins going and some of the dynamics there. I think I would think gross margin really in both short-term and long-term.","Short-term, the issues of gross margin are going to be primarily around cotton. So this quarter, we -- cotton prices were 37% higher than the last. This is the last quarter where that dynamic comes into play. Beginning next quarter our cotton prices will be flowing through the P&L would be lower than prior year.","So, last year in the fourth quarter our cotton prices were $1.74 in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter in the $1.80 range. And so we will see substantially lower cotton cost flowing through really the -- between now even from the fourth quarter on through likely through the all of next year, that\u2019s kind of the short-term dynamic.","I think longer-term, we think we can continue to drive gross margin expansion by having a well executed pricing strategy and by continuing to deliver consistent cost savings over time. I think it was prudent we can do both of those things and sometimes very challenges circumstances.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the International business, I guess what do you still see as sort of the greatest challenges of the regions, where you are seeing the most pressure and what are your priorities in terms of investing internationally?","Rick Moss","Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about International, Bill mentioned in his remarks. First of all I want to put it in perspective. Its about 11% of our overall sales and while its critical component of our long-term growth prospects. In the near-term, our results are going to be driven by how we do in the U.S. and we are doing very well in the U.S.","That said we still want to get ourselves back with International to double-digit sales growth. As we\u2019ve felt the issues that International business was feeling and the same thing that U.S. business was in the first part of the year. We expected that to start to return the double-digit sales growth by now, it hasn\u2019t.","So, it have -- its forced us to sort of step back take stock and figure out why it hasn\u2019t. And really there is -- as well as a little bit of macro issues we really haven\u2019t done as well tactically in terms of leveraging our great innovation, we\u2019ve got in the U.S. and fully leveraging that U.S. supply chain. So, we are looking at some things to address that. Our intent is to get it back on the growth track that we have laid out, but it may take us few more quarters until we do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Krasik from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Hi, everybody. Good quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Just talking the people in the industry, it seems like there is wall after back-to-school there\u2019s a lot of inventory. There is sort of disorganization, shelves aren\u2019t cleared out and that\u2019s a driving a lot of it, lack of replenishment or slowdown in replenishment. I mean is that the case, is that something you can control and improve going forward. So, you don\u2019t get this massive slowdown in replenishment right after back-to-school.","Rich Noll","So, we\u2019re not necessarily seeing a massive slowdown in the replenishment. So, I am not sure exactly, where you are getting that.","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","I guess just seasonally, not massive replenishment suddenly. I guess just sort of seasonally you get this wall after back-to-school?","Rich Noll","Yeah. I mean that just the normal cadence, right where -- the beginning of the year during the winter sales going to be slower. They built towards back-to-school period and then there is that sort of in between, between back-to-school and holiday especially in October and all of retail tends to slowdown.","I don\u2019t see that as a problem. We just always need to understand it, make sure that we are flowing inventory accordingly. And I don\u2019t think this year Bill anything slowing differently than we\u2019ve seen on average for many years in a row, is that correct?","Bill Nictakis","Absolutely.","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Colder weather happens, it tends to help a little bit.","Rich Noll","Help a little bit, pick up a little bit earlier but the good thing about winters, it always eventually gets cold.","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. I think so for last, but let\u2019s\u2026","Rich Noll","Yeah. Yeah. Lastly\u2026","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Right. Then just a couple of others, in addition so you\u2019re going to reinstate the media spending next year, you\u2019ve talked about getting distribution savings as well, will that portion return or is that permanent savings?","Rich Noll","Yeah. We always talked about being able to optimize our supply chain, which includes distribution and trying ring out $30 million to $40 million of savings a year. We\u2019ve been talking about that for a number of years. We\u2019ve also set on average you\u2019ll see about two thirds of that benefit show up and gross margin, about a third of it on SG&A. Some of the SG&A savings that we are seeing with distribution this year, all part of that, we feel really good about how much progress that group is making and we continue to expect further progress next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Marotta from C.L. King & Associates. Your line is now open.","Steve Marotta - C.L. King & Associates","Good evening, everyone. Bill, I want to go back to your question somebody asked couple of questions ago regarding pricing next year, you mentioned Innerwear is complete, outwear the first half is locked. The intimation there is that pricing is flat on year-over-year basis for the next 15 months or so is that accurate?","Bill Nictakis","No. I don\u2019t think we say it\u2019s flat.","Rich Noll","Yeah. I don\u2019t think we are trying to -- let me go ahead and answer that. We were trying -- we are trying to say that it\u2019s finalized. We were trying to imply any sort of direction, nor would we want to. We\u2019ll talk about those types of specifics, when we give the specific 2013 guidance on our Q4 call.","Steve Marotta - C.L. King & Associates","Okay. And excuse me, lastly as it relates to the $26 million or so decrease in SG&A cost you mentioned that major part of that was the decrease in marketing, is it possible that these are the components of that decline on a year-over-year basis?","Bill Nictakis","We don\u2019t give it that detail again generally for competitive reasons. But as Rich pointed out, the -- we are seeing it really across all the categories of SG&A. Distribution costs are down. Other selling expenses are down and as well as overhead expenses in the organization has been intensely focused on reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Beder from Brean Capital. Your line is now open.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Good afternoon. Congrats on a solid quarter.","Rich Noll","Thank you.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","No, we can\u2019t talk J. C. Penney at depth. I\u2019d like to throw in something else here. Do you have an anniversary as an event in J. C. Penney in Q4. I am curious what you are seeing for 2013 in terms of potential shop-in-shop, but where you are going to go J. C. Penney.","Rich Noll","Yeah. I just said, the good news about Penney strategy is to focus on Blends placed our wheelhouse right. I mean we have the leading brand of underwear. Bali and Playtex are among the absolute leading brands in that apparel.","So, over the long haul, what Penney is doing placed our strength. We are dealing with the short-term challenges and in terms of shops right now they are send or go to they are not going to have a branded underwear shop, so that sort of off the table. We\u2019re going to do well in our share of underwear they went dust sales, but they are not putting a Hanes concept shops for instance.","And the Bali and Playtex sort of remains to be seen how they are going to handle that, that piece of it. But key challenge for us is just -- as they get the traffic back in the stores we will hopefully benefit with that.","Bill Nictakis","Yeah. In terms of the overlap, we didn\u2019t really start seeing the major declines until their Q1, which started February, March, April and when they started to really implement this strategy. So we don\u2019t actually start to overlap this for quite a while. And I think it remains to be seen how the consumers respond to their new strategy next year, it may that they have got a new base from which they can now grow as they institute these shops and things like that.","It maybe that the consumers have started to find other places to shop and they are traffic continues to decline. I have no idea nor well I speculate on what happen, but I do think we want to be cautious and wait until we start to see it happen, before we start to decide which direction Penney is going to go.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Great. If I look about free cash flow, you are going to use $500 million of free cash next year to pay down the debt, I would assume, based upon what you are talking about here, we\u2019re pretty much ahead of the schedule little bit, when you enter the year, give us our returns on million dollar in cash now. What is your thoughts on after that debt is paid down, what to do the excess cash, as I think we know the debt after that really is to make sense to pay down?","Rick Moss","Yeah. At that point is as we pay down that $500 million of debt, we still anticipate good strong cash flow into 2014 and so on. And there are three things that we can do with are obviously acquisition, share buybacks or dividends. And we\u2019ve talked about bolt-on acquisitions can make sense for us. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that a zero dividend pretty doing low and having some level of dividend could make sense.","Although, I don\u2019t think you should ever look to us as being the major vehicle that we will return value to shareholder is by primarily being a dividend stock. And -- but I think of all three of those could actually be on the table. We don\u2019t need to make any decisions yet, we still have another $500 million of debt to pay down.","But once, we do and we start to formulate what our plans were, about year from now, we\u2019ll start making sure that we are communicating that to the investment community.","Operator","Your last question comes from Andrew Burns from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","Hi, guys. Congrats on solid quarter.","Rich Noll","Thank you.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","Getting in the stores for last few months, it appears that you\u2019re doing a much better job of highlighting the transition for extra units per pack, particularly in undershirts compared to your key competitors. Have you found this to be the case in the competitive advantage in terms of driving sell-through?","Rich Noll","Well, I appreciate you notice that, that we are working on that and making some progress. Yeah, this is one of the ways, we said, hey, we are going to go and make sure we\u2019re delivering value to the consumers. So we did, do the bonus pack six for the price of five kind of thing. And that\u2019s been a good tactic to help our customers protect their AURs and basket rings while delivering value to the consumer.","Andrew Burns - D.A. Davidson","Thanks. And you talked about this innovate to elevate initiative and it sounds like, we\u2019ll hear more about it and see some more of that in 2013? Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the market that gives you confidence that this is sort of up market higher price point product is the direction to go and now you are talking about potentially moving up market and existing accounts or even new distribution points? Thank you.","Rich Noll","Yeah. Well, primarily focused on existing accounts and I will give you an example of ComfortBlend underwear that, I talked about and Rich mentioned. We have been testing and planning with this idea for couple years, we know, we would be good, but its doing about 60% better than we had planned it to do this year. And our customers are recognizing that because they are given us more space next year, additional space to support that.","This is what, we looking at ComfortBlend is being sort of a home run idea, that really can change consumer behavior, when we saw this a decade ago, we launched Hanes TAGLESS T-shirts, it was a drawers changing event. It was such a benefit to consumers that basically, consumers were replacing their current drawers of T-shirts with Hanes TAGLESS T\u2019s and w had a couple really, really good years, because of that.","We are starting to hear antidote to the same kind of thing with ComfortBlend, it\u2019s such a superior product, that people say, hey, this is great, I am going to change out my drawers and replace it with, ComfortBlend. So, we are seeing a big success there. We are seeing it with our Smart Size and Comfort revolution, Bali bra, so just trading up our existing accounts, is really what we are focused on.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

For today\u2019s call, Rich, Gerald and Rick will provide some brief remarks and then we will open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thank you, T.C. Hanesbrands delivered strong first quarter results as revenue increased 1%, operating profit increased 10% and earnings per share increased 18%. Our ability to consistently magnify our growth rates as you walk down the P&L demonstrates that our strategy to create long-term shareholder value, are working. We are driving innovation in our categories. We are generating efficiencies within our supply chain. We are enhancing our margins and we are effectively allocating our capital.","Within the first 100 days of 2016, we increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $380 million of stock and announced the acquisition of Champion Europe. Overall, the year is unfolding as we expected. Point-of-sale trends have rebounded from their severely negative levels in Q4. Our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule and our initiatives to reenergize sales growth are on track. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2016 guidance. Add to this our continued focus on executing our long-term strategies and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thanks, Rich. We delivered solid results for the first quarter, but more importantly, we made significant progress on our sales initiatives, our inventory actions and our integrations.","So, let me speak to these in order. Starting with our sales initiatives, if you recall last quarter, I walk you through several initiatives that I had the organization focused on delivering. One of the initiatives is to expand the space of our successful Innovate-to-Elevate platforms. For 2016, we secured new space for various X-Temp products in the mass and mid-tier channels.","A second initiative is to ensure we are focusing on our core products with the right balance of promotion, media and innovation. During the first quarter, we began rebalancing our marketing features to drive our core and the initial sell-through results were positive. As we look to the second half, we are on track to launch our next big innovation directly into our core.","And the third initiative is to drive online growth. As the migration to online accelerates, we are reallocating our personnel and marketing resources to capture this consumer shift. In the first quarter, our U.S. online sales across all channels increased 15% over last year and now represent 8% of our domestic sales. I feel really good about the progress we have made. While these initiatives are not expected to fully impact sales growth until the second half of the year, our progress to-date gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 1% to 3% revenue growth guidance for the year.","Turning to our inventory reduction actions, recall that the bulk of these actions are expected to come in the first half, while the reduction in our inventory level is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue through the end of the year. During the first quarter, we took time out within our manufacturing network, we lowered the use of external sourcing and we reduced raw material purchases. We expect to complete essentially all of these actions in the second quarter. We are on track to reduce our inventory as planned and this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.","Next, I would like to provide an update on our acquisition integrations, beginning with Hanes Europe. We are making great progress on our synergies and remain on track to deliver \u20ac100 million of annual operating profit by the end of 2018. The insourcing of production continues to ramp up and we have begun reducing SG&A as 120 people exited our operations in France at the end of the quarter. We have completed nearly 8,000 action items and are about two-thirds of the way through the integration.","Touching briefly on their business, Hanes Europe had a solid quarter, delivering operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan. The European price increases are now in place and we are on track to generate substantial profit growth this year as synergies ramp.","Turning to Knights Apparel, we have completed essentially all of the integration actions and are on track to double their operating profit by 2018. With respect to our Champion Japan acquisition, this integration is complete and we now generate roughly $140 million in sales in Japan between our Champion and Hanes product lines. Lastly, we have begun our initial integration planning for Champion Europe. We are excited about the significant revenue growth opportunity for the Champion brand and we are on track for midyear close. Overall, our integrations are progressing on or ahead of schedule, which not only gives us confidence in our ability to deliver $40 million of synergy benefits this year, but also provides us with the bandwidth to do additional acquisitions.","So in summary, our strategies are working, our acquisition synergies are ramping on schedule, we are progressing on our initiatives to reenergize sales growth and we are on track to reduce our inventory levels. All of which gives us confidence in our ability to drive low single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth in 2016 and beyond.","I will now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Moss","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered another record first quarter. The combination of our margin enhancement strategies, our acquisition strategies and our capital allocation strategies drove an 18% increase in our earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.","Now, let me give you some color on the quarter. Sales increased 1% over last year driven by the contribution from Knights Apparel and the 1% growth in our Innerwear segment, which was partially offset by $12 million of currency headwinds. As expected, our gross profit margin declined from last year. Efficiency gains from the supply chain were more than offset by the recognition of certain inventory reduction costs, which resulted in a 20 basis point decline in our margin. Our guidance costs were close to $20 million of inventory related costs this year, $8 million of which hit our P&L in the first quarter, with the majority of the remaining costs expected to come in the second quarter.","SG&A costs in the quarter declined approximately 130 basis points to 25.8% of sales. Key drivers of this improvement were synergies from acquisitions, planned catalog circulation reductions and tight cost controls. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our operating profit margin to 12.1%. Our earnings per share of $0.26 was an increase of 18% over last year. The $0.04 improvement includes $0.01 from operational performance, $0.01 from the 2015 share repurchases and $0.02 of expense timing between the first and second quarters. And lastly, our cash flow from operations was a use of $285 million roughly in line with our expectations.","Turning to guidance, we reiterated our full 2016 guidance, which does not yet include the impact from Champion Europe. Looking at the key components, we expect sales of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which at the midpoint implies a 100 basis point increase in our operating profit margin. We expect EPS of $1.85 to $1.91, which represents 11% to 15% growth over last year. And we expect cash flow from operations to be $750 million to $850 million.","So in closing, we are off to a great start in 2016 and we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance. Looking forward, as we execute on our proven long-term strategies, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns for many years to come.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to T.C.","T. C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and we will continue as time allows. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Brean Capital.","Eric Tracy","Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Eric.","Eric Tracy","So Rich, I guess just to hit the stabilization that we are seeing on the revenue line and more importantly kind of looks like with the visibility you have to kind of continuing that. So maybe separate the point-of-sale trends that were impacted by weather versus some of the visibility that you have to space gains and\/or new programs for the back half of the year?","Rich Noll","Yes. I will just say the \u2013 start with the consumer environment, we are seeing the overall consumer environment continue to be relatively choppy like it\u2019s been for 4 or 5 years. We are starting to call up the new normal. And I think some of the stuff that we saw in Q4 was sort of isolated to that quarter. More specifically about the current business, Gerald, you want to talk to Eric\u2019s question?","Gerald Evans","Yes. I think it\u2019s really playing out like we expected. We have seen POS pickup, as Rich referred to, coming out of the down period of the fourth quarter. We have seen nice, positive pickup in POS going into the first quarter. And you see that in our Innerwear sales that are up 1%. And it just feels like it\u2019s tracking about like we expected. We have begun to implement our sales actions. And while the bulk of those are really expected to impact the latter half of the year, the early steps we took on \u2013 to refocus on the core have been very positive, seeing good results as well. So, we feel good about our ability to deliver on our guidance.","Eric Tracy","And I guess my follow-up would be a little bit bigger picture, but how you guys are thinking about managing through this channel evolution? I know you believe that the consumer is channel-agnostic, but as online be it your own and\/or third-party omni-channel continues to develop. In terms of the infrastructure that you have in place, what sort of resources you need to reallocate to ensure that, that business continues to take the requisite share that it should?","Rich Noll","Yes. The apparel sales are clearly shifting online. And online is growing very fast for total apparel sales. And we are really focused on that as well. We grew our sales 15% in the quarter and we are now about 8% of our domestic sales. Our online, we are shifting resources, both people and marketing resources, to go after that opportunity. We hold leading shares in our categories online already, but we are now seeing those shares grow. And in fact in the large pure player our shares actually is large in our core categories as it is in our brick-and-mortar channel. So, we see it as the place that\u2019s growing. We are focused on that. It really is just a reflection of our focus on omnipresence. We want to be where the consumer wants to shop and increasingly that\u2019s online and that\u2019s where we will go.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Rich Noll","Hi, Omar.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good afternoon. Nice quarter guys.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Omar Saad","Wanted to focus on the Activewear category, little bit of bounce back, but still a lower run-rate than kind of where you have been at, what\u2019s going on in there? I think there has been some changes to the 69 target, some of the strategies and products and maybe bring a little bit more fashion and style in there. I mean, any sort of updates on what\u2019s going on in that category, because I know it\u2019s important you guys, especially now that you are going to be kind of, owning the Champion brand globally?","Rich Noll","Sure. Let me just start with saying that overall the business was up 3%. In the quarter, the sports license apparel business performed particularly well, both the gear business and we did have the wrap of the Knights Apparel acquisition in the quarter. Underneath that, to dig a little deeper, the Champion business did experience in sports, specialty, and department stores experienced a headwind of the Sports Authority bankruptcy in the quarter. Now, while it\u2019s not particularly big to the total company, it\u2019s only about 0.5% of sales. It\u2019s a big customer within that mix. And so that business overall was flat for the quarter. When you peel that back, the rest of the business was actually up nicely, double-digit rate. So, the core business is sound, just a little bit of headwind there from the TSA perspective. The POS in that business is up double-digits as well in the core business. So we see nice fundamentals there. The Champion at mass business is \u2013 we are in the final changes of redoing that product. It\u2019s beginning to flow in now, continues through the second half and really project that returning to mid single-digit growth in the second half of the year. So, when we look at all that together, we are optimistic about as we turned the corner on that business. So, we will see nice positive growth through the year.","Omar Saad","That\u2019s really helpful. And then one quick follow-up, within the intimate apparel on the bra side, anything going on there? I haven\u2019t heard you guys talk about it a while. We are hearing more and more about the Bra Lip trend. That might be a younger consumer than you guys skew towards. But any update on the bra business, which was little bit controversial a few quarters ago?","Rich Noll","Well, you know what innerwear business in total was up a point. I think as you peel back the consumer or the retail environment, what you see is a mixed trend within channels, summer up, summer down in the case of the mass channel, it was a little stronger as we look at mid-tier and department store, we see a little weaker performance. Our intimates business was down in the quarter and it\u2019s really affected by a higher concentration of sales. Roughly 40% of that business is in that mass and our net mid-tier and department store channel. So, it was down modestly in the quarter. What \u2013 on the Innerwear or the basics business on the other side was up and it benefited from both the stronger trends in mass where the predominance of that business is sold as well as the early efforts we had to refocus on the core.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR & Company.","Susan Anderson","Hi, good evening. Good job on a great quarter. So, I was going to maybe drill down on SG&A that leveraged pretty strongly. Was this mainly due to the DBA cuts or how much of that contributed to it? And did those come maybe sooner than you guys expected? And then I guess just the timing of the other third?","Rich Noll","Sure. You are right. There are really two key drivers \u2013 three key drivers in the quarter on SG&A, one with synergies. We are seeing good synergies coming out of our Hanes Europe DBA acquisition. They are doing a great job on that. We are also continuing to be very prudent in our spending as good cost controls are in place. Another driver was the reduction in the number of catalogs that we distributed in the quarter.","Susan Anderson","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the international, it looks like the growth improved from fourth quarter. I guess, what was the big driver there? Was the pricing in place in first quarter to help drive that or was it better, less FX impact or maybe just units going up?","Rich Noll","I mean, as I peel it back, Susan, looking at overall, total international was up 3% on a constant currency basis and that comes from a number of buckets. I would start first with our Asia business had an outstanding quarter driven by our Japanese business and we got our outstanding team there that\u2019s doing a great job. And their sales were up strongly. They are about $140 million in business now in both the Hanes and Champion businesses. They are performing very well. We saw growth in Mexico and Canada both on a constant currency basis. And then from the standpoint of Hanes Europe as we have mentioned in our remarks, the operating profit was slightly ahead of plan for the quarter. We have got our price increases now in place and we are on track as we execute our integration to generate substantial profit growth there as well as the synergies ramp. So, we feel good about the international business. We are really hitting on all cylinders there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, good evening. Congrats on a nice quarter. You have mentioned the \u2013 you obviously are handing at some pretty meaningful innovation that you have coming in the core and the second half. It sounds like it\u2019s a little bit bigger than maybe some of the one-offs in the Innovate-to-Elevate program we have heard about from you so far. And obviously, I don\u2019t expect anything competitive, but maybe you can tell us a little bit about some of the components you see how it will impact revenues. Is this a shelf space gain? Is it a \u2013 for a new innovation or is it mostly pricing? Any help there would be helpful.","Gerald Evans","Well, I think what we have said in the past, it\u2019s been a number of years since we have innovated in that core product. We have done a lot of innovation platforms. The last big innovation in that area was the Tagless tee over a decade ago and then we have introduced Tagless in the bottoms. So, this will be the next sort of upgrade in that product from the standpoint of another innovation. I don\u2019t want to give a lot more than that other than to say that it\u2019s very well-received by the consumer and you will be seeing it in the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then I was very positively surprised to see the gross margin delivery in the quarter. At the same time, I was a little surprised to see the inventory a little stickier than we thought. And given the commentary we had last quarter about some of the downtime in the factories to help normalize the working capital inventory it sounded like it might just \u2013 you have been a little bit more focused in the first quarter than we thought. Was there another component to inventory that was an offset there that we should think about?","Rick Moss","Yes. I would say as you think about inventory levels, the \u2013 actually, the rate of increase \u2013 remember, we \u2013 during the first half of the year, we are building inventory towards back-to-school. And so \u2013 but we built it at a slower pace this year than we did last year about $30 million slower pace in inventory. So, that\u2019s I think an encouraging early sign. But as Gerald has said, the bulk of the inventory benefits will come to us in the second half of the year after back-to-school. So to the \u2013 and in terms of the P&L impact, with sort of about $8 million of P&L impact for the cost associated with those actions, we are still thinking $20 million for the full year, most of it in the \u2013 the bulk of it in the first half. And so more shifting to the second quarter then as we now are implementing the plans. So actually, we are right on where we thought we were going to be both in terms of cash flow overall in terms of our inventory position. And we are very pleased with where we are right now and feel good about delivering those numbers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","Rich Noll","Hey, David.","David Glick","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to talk about the acquisition-related charges, I think investors have become little more focused just given the degree of charges that you have incurred the last 2 years. It was good to see the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings be less in Q1. I just wondered if you could give us an update. I know Champion Europe is to come that hasn\u2019t closed. So excluding that, what should we see this year in acquisition-related and other charges as you described them and what are the sources? And should we see that number really coming down relative to the last 2 years?","Rick Moss","So, the \u2013 in our guidance, we actually \u2013 David, we actually narrowed the XA charges guidance to really 1 point to $85 million for the full year. We did $25 million in the first quarter. That would suggest a slowing trend through the year. For the full year, $85 million, it\u2019s about 80% of that is for Hanes Europe for the DBA acquisition. About 15% of it will go to Knights Apparel and the balance is associated with the reacquisition of our Champion license in Japan. And so the XA is very limited to acquisitions only in 2016. And so you are seeing the pace of those charges slow down.","David Glick","And the vast majority will be SG&A versus gross margin?","Rick Moss","I am not sure I would say the vast majority, but the bulk of them will be SG&A.","David Glick","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari","Good afternoon. Nice quarter. How are you, Rich?","Rich Noll","Great.","Taposh Bari","Rick, can you give us the organic constant currency growth number for the entire company for the quarter?","Rick Moss","Well, we said that constant currency growth was the 2% number and the Knights Apparel was $21 million of sales in the quarter.","Taposh Bari","Okay. We will figure that out. Thank you. And then Rich maybe for you on the revenue line, nice to see return to positive growth in the first quarter, up 1%, you are guiding the year to up 1% to 3%. Remind us how you are thinking about the past throughout the rest of the year. I know a lot of the year is still ahead of you. In other words, just try to maybe get a better sense of what happened \u2013 what needs to happen for you to get to the high end and what are some of the discrete tailwinds at your back for the next 9 months? Thanks.","Rich Noll","Yes. And I will just add to which I will just conceptually say nothing has really changed from how we laid that out on our Q4 call. And I will let Gerald talk a little bit more about the details.","Gerald Evans","Yes. You may remember at the low end of the range, it was really built on two things, the wrap of about $50 million in \u2013 at one time at wrap on acquisitions, the combination of the Knights wrap and our take-back of our license for Champion. The balance of that was around not having one-time events happen again, the one-time reduction of inventory in one of our large retailers and our bra consolidation. As you move out toward the 3%, it\u2019s really two things. One, we would assume a more normalized fourth quarter, one it\u2019s not the warmest on record. And the second was the key growth initiatives that we have spoken about. One is continuing to lever our Innovate-to-Elevate with things like expanding X-Temp, which we are seeing that expansion take place. The second was refocusing on the core, combination of rebalancing back toward the core. We began to execute a few of those events in the first quarter, but most of those are actually coming later in the year. And then with that is also to provide innovation to the core as we have discussed earlier. And then finally to focus on online and as you think about how that moving from 1% to 3% might take place, a lot of that would come in the second half of the year between executing our focus on the events, the space expansion as well as the normalization of the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen & Company.","John Kernan","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rich Noll","Sure.","John Kernan","Good to see point-of-sales trends come back. So, just wanted to go back to the cash flow, obviously, your cash flow from operation guidance is really robust this year. Is there anything that would suggest that, that would have to come down going into 2017? Is that the new sustainable run-rate of your cash flow from operations? Is there any pension contributions or working capital changes that would really prevent that from being the new run-rate of your cash flow?","Rick Moss","I would say the answer is yes. That\u2019s a pretty good proxy for going forward. I think what you are going to see, generally speaking, is modest pension contributions. Working capital generally as we stabilize inventory this year going forward, working capital should not really be much of a source for use in any given year generally speaking. But then obviously, cash flow will be driven up by \u2013 as we continue to drive higher income. So, I think we are on the right track on it. And I think that it certainly is a sustainable number.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks. And then just one follow-up, obviously Walmart and Target have been great partners for you for a long time. I think obviously one of their biggest competitors, Amazon is making a fairly significant push into apparel and some of your mass product would probably translate well on that platform. Has there been discussions with Amazon, is that a channel that you think can be a growth platform for you going forward?","Gerald Evans","We are a branded seller. And obviously, Amazon is one of our customers that we work with, just like we work across all retail channels. And as online grows, clearly, Amazon becomes one of the customers. And I think we have noted that there is a large pure player that\u2019s one of our largest emerging customers. It was a number 7, I think we have noted in our FAQ. And we work across all channels that trade accordingly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone. Congrats. Thanks for taking my question. On the inventory, just two quick questions. First, how should we think about the inventory growth as you progress through the year? And then just second given the \u2013 I think you mentioned you have more cost in Q2 versus Q1 in the gross margin line, should we expect gross margin to be a little weaker year-over-year in Q2 relative to Q1? Thanks, guys.","Rick Moss","Sure. I will take the gross margin question first. Yes, you should see it be a little weaker. And then the back half of the year, you should see the gross profit trend normalize. In terms of the inventory, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see \u2013 we would expect to see the inventory decline year-over-year in the second half. So, we \u2013 but I think the same trends you saw in the first quarter where we are seeing a slowing of the growth versus last year, you will see probably through the second quarter.","Rich Noll","Yes. And I want to stress about the inventory, since we have gotten a couple of different questions about it. As we have taken a lot of the actions, so a lot of the things are now done to ensure that the inventories will start to drawdown to a much lower level than we had last year, but you do have to wait for the sales rates to go over Q2. And as Rick said, we don\u2019t actually cross the line below until it actually \u2013 I think the projection is about July, which you wouldn\u2019t see until \u2013 in Q3. So, we have done all \u2013 many of the things or they will be finished within the second quarter. And then inventory will just bleed off through the rest of the year. It\u2019s almost like its math at that point.","Ike Boruchow","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Rich Noll","Hi, Anna.","Anna Andreeva","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys and congrats. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess, great to hear about the POS inflection in the first quarter. Just curious has that continued into 2Q? Is mass channel performing better right now than department stores? And what are you guys seeing with the order book into back-to-school? And secondly, how do we think about the cadence in the buybacks during the year, especially given the cash layout for Champion? Thanks so much.","Gerald Evans","Let me start with the question about our POS trends considering \u2013 continuing into the second quarter. It\u2019s really difficult to tell at this point in time. You got an Easter shift that took place from April into late March and it creates a lot of noise between the two periods. So, it\u2019s early days and difficult to really give you any insight on that at this point.","Rick Moss","In terms of the share repurchases going forward, what we have done is \u2013 the $380 million is in line with our activity and was \u2013 has been factored into our guidance that we have reiterated. As we get to the \u2013 towards the latter part of the year and we assess our cash position, we will then decide whether we want to do anymore at that point.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Just to an earlier point, so given the first quarter\u2019s operating cash decline, can you just talk to the reiteration of that full year cash number from operations? Is the variance just a function of this inventory improvement being back half? And then what would the implied second quarter share count be just from the mass given the late quarter repurchase? Thanks.","Rick Moss","Okay. So in terms of the cash flow, I think we are roughly right where we expected to be at this point. So, we are right on plan. Yes, it will be driven largely by the significant drop in inventory in the second half of the year, but also by our continued growth in the profitability will also contribute to that and our reduced XA charges through the year. So, that\u2019s \u2013 so we feel very good about that. In terms of the share count for the second quarter, we will probably be in about \u2013 I think probably about $385 million type number, $385 million type number.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Rick Moss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to T. C. Robillard for any additional comments.","T. C.

For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big-picture themes, Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in our businesses and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thank you, T.C. Our business model continues to deliver significant returns for our shareholders as contributions from our acquisition strategy and margin improvements in our base business drove 16% growth in earnings per share in the first quarter and that was on top of last year\u2019s 50% increase.","Our acquisition strategy is working extremely well and this is a great quarter to see how all facets of this strategy are delivering significant growth. For example, Gear For Sports, which has been a part of our core operations for several years contributed double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the quarter.","Maidenform, which was fully integrated only last year delivered additional synergies and contributed nicely to the first quarter\u2019s profit growth. As we continue to internalize their production and launch our ComfortFlex Fit [indiscernible] platform under the Maidenform brand later this year, we are on track to more than double their operating profit to $80 million by the end of 2016.","DBApparel in just its second full quarter as part of Hanes brands was also a strong contributor to results. We started the Works Council process last week and we expect to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continuing into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of EUR100 million of operating profit. ","And only seven months after we added DBA, we closed our latest acquisition Knights Apparel. This is a great acquisition, making us the leading supplier of licensed collegian apparel in both the mass and college bookstore channels. As we leverage the scale of our supply chain, the graphic art capabilities of our Gear For Sports business and our expertise in the mass channel we believe we can double their operating profit to more than $40 million within the next two to three years.","Integration planning has already begun and we believe a large portion of the integration actions can be completed by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016. Now that we have several acquisitions under our belt, Investors are able to see how our acquisition strategy can deliver multi-year returns to our shareholders. And with just these expected synergy contributions, we believe we have great earnings momentum. ","So in summary, we are off to a great start in 2015 with our first quarter results coming right in line with our overall plan. We feel good about the trends in our business and we have great visibility for the remainder of the year. This along with the addition of Knights Apparel gives us confidence this early in the year to increase our earnings guidance which now assumes mid to high teens growth.","Looking forward, we believe the ongoing margin drivers in our base business, combined with the current energy roadmap for DBA and Knights Apparel, position us for continued double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thanks, Rich. We were able to deliver another quarter of strong earnings growth by focusing on the things we can control and executing our long-term strategy. Our acquisitions are paying dividends, we are gaining share in our key categories. Our innovation platforms are driving additional space gains and our operating margin continued to expand, up another 90 basis points over the last year, excluding DBA.","Looking at the quarter, our innovation platforms continued to perform well, helping drive sales growth in men\u2019s underwear and bras while overall innerwear sales decreased over last year. The decrease was due to a short-term retail inventory reduction in basics by a major account which dropped their retail inventory to its lowest level in five years. This short-term reduction has already begun to reverse in the first two weeks of April and the good thing about replenishment categories is that these types of inventory imbalances don\u2019t have a lasting impact on the business. ","Bra revenue increased for the first time in several quarters as we began to anniversary the impact from our brand consolidation efforts and retail inventory normalized, particularly in the mid-tier channel. For the quarter, innerwear\u2019s operating margins increased 310 basis points driven by Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and efficiency gains from our supply chain.","Turning to Activewear, sales in the quarter increased slightly over last year as double-digit growth in Gear For Sports and increases in Hanes Activewear were somewhat offset by Champion. In the sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels, Champion has a significant amount of space gain this year. With many new programs shipping in the second quarter, we believe champion is positioned for strong full-year growth. We were also encouraged by Champion\u2019s sell-through trends in the mass channel which showed improvement in the quarter.","Switching to international, on a constant-currency basis, we saw strong double-digit sales and operating profit growth in Japan and Latin America while results in our ongoing Canada operations improved sequentially through the quarter.","With respect to DBApparel, they performed well in the quarter contributing approximately $184 million in sales and better-than-expected profits driven by favorable supply chain variances and strong expense controls. Sales in the key geographies of Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were in line with plan. And in France, sales growth was driven by the successful extension of the Dean [ph] megabrand beyond hosiery, underwear and intimates into socks. ","Now let me take a step back and provide you with a broader sense of our business. The overall consumer environment remains choppy with good weeks followed by bad weeks. That said, the overall trends within our business remain strong. Sell-through, especially with our Innerwear Basics business continued to outpace shipments and help drive market share gains in the quarter. Our innovation platforms are performing well. In fact, we are positioned to more than double our space this year and we continue to drive efficiency gains in our supply chain.","Looking forward, we have great visibility into the remainder of the year as our space is set, our pricing is in place, the transaction impact from exchange rates is hedged and we have locked-in most of our key input cost.","So to sum up, the trends in our business remain strong. We have great visibility into the remainder of the year and our acquisition strategy is delivering substantial benefit giving us confidence in our ability to delivered double-digit earnings growth for the next several years. ","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Gerald. We had another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Contributions from our acquisitions strategy along with continued margin improvements in our base business drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.","Now let me give you some color on our record first quarter results. Sales in the quarter increased 15% in constant currency with DBA contributing approximately 17 points of growth. Our acquisition strategy continues to be a major contributor to operating profit. Double-digit growth in Gear For Sports, synergies from Maidenform as well as the addition of DBApparel had helped drive a 16% increase in our operating profit for the quarter.","Looking at margins, our gross profit margin improved 300 basis points to 38.1%, with DBA contributing approximately 190 basis points of the increase, while the remainder was driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain and benefits from our Innovate-to-Elevate.","SG&A costs in the quarter increased 280 basis points to 27.1%, with DBA accounting for roughly 270 basis points of the increase. This resulted in a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin as the 90 basis point improvement in our base business; more than offset the expected 70 basis points of dilution from the addition of DBA. Interest and other expense of $27 million was roughly $5 million above last year, due to higher debt levels from our acquisition of DBA, while the tax rate of 16% was the same compared to last year. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.22, a 16% increase over last year.","Turning to guidance, with our Knights Apparel acquisition being completed so quickly, we're now able to increase our 2015 outlook. We\u2019re increasing our full-year sales guidance to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.95 billion, which includes the addition of approximately $160 million from Knights Apparel offset by a reduction of roughly $35 million from additional pressure in various exchange rates. We're increasing our operating profit guidance to a range of $853 million to $873 million, with the entire $18 million increase due to the addition of Knights Apparel. Remember, there is no impact to our operating profit guidance from our lower exchange rate assumptions as the FX transaction costs are mainly hedged and the FX translation impact is minimal.","Interest and other related expense is now expected to be a range of $95 million to a $100 million, an increase of $5 million, due to the additional debt associated with the Knights acquisition. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%. And similar to last year, we expect the tax rate to be higher in the first half of the year. We believe the split between the first and second half of 2014 continues to be a good proxy for 2015. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.03 to a range of $1.61 to $1.66, which represents strong mid-to-high teens growth for 2015. We expect cash flow from operations to be $550 million to $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million.","Looking long term, we expect our CapEx should average around 1.75% of sales, which will allow our global supply chain to remain competitive, while also handling the increased capacity needs from our acquisition strategy. And over time, as we spend at this level, our CapEx should roughly equal our depreciation. With respect to DD&A, our estimates of approximately 630 million euros in sales and approximately 30 million euros in operating profit are unchanged. This implies about 130 basis points of margin dilution from DBA for the year. We expect DBA to continue to have a significant impact on our reported gross margin and SG&A rate until we anniversary the acquisition in September. ","So, in closing, we're off to a great start in 2015 and with our visibility for the remainder of the year, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver mid-to-high teens EPS growth. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe our business model is designed to deliver continued strong shareholder returns as the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and the returns from deploying future cash flows should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks Ric. That concludes the recap of our performance for the first quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows, since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy","Good afternoon everyone.","Rich Noll","Hi, Eric.","Eric Tracy","I guess, Rich, for you if I could start and maybe Gerald as well, just as it relates to the inventory reduction from a major partner here in the quarter, just two weeks of supply, lowest total in five years, just kind of talk through you know the rationale of them doing that, it sounds like it's reversing in April but speak to that specifically and then, what you're seeing beyond that within the core business?","Rich Noll","So, let me take that Eric. When we look at the underwear business, what we see is our overall fundamentals for the underwear business are very sound, our share positions grew in the quarter, our POS is stronger than shipments, space is sound and actually we're expanding space behind a number of innovations as we look forward to the balance of the year. So strong fundamentals, we do see fluctuations from time to time in our order patterns and in the quarter, we saw it in one of major retailers, and in fact those inventories did fall by almost two weeks of supply, which is really the lowest level we've seen in five years. What I can say is, the great thing about our category is, ultimately over time, orders and replenishment, ultimately recover to the level of POS trends, and what we've already seen, as we enter this April period, is in fact those orders are recovering and flowing nicely. So, I don't see any fundamental shift there, it's really just an abrasion of fluctuation in the order pattern.","Eric Tracy","Okay. And then if I could switch gears a little bit, that you know something that's emerging here is kind of a key topic is this Trans-Pacific Partnership legislation that just got agreed to be fast tracked last week. Obviously, you guys have some decent cotton exposure in Vietnam, one of the TPP participant, so Richard, I would love to get your thoughts on just speaking of the potential likelihood of something getting reached here and then, how we should think about that playing out, in fact, it does get resolved.","Rich Noll","Yeah, and so let me talk about it from two dimensions, one is sort of our overall strategic perspective and then I'll give you a little bit of color around what we think maybe going on in Washington. At the end of the day, one of the reasons that we wanted to make sure our supply chain was balanced across hemispheres and we diversified both across countries was to be able to make sure we could take advantage of things that might emerge for example of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, when in fact if it is actually approved and passed by all the countries involved. It will give us a substantial advantage vis-a-vis those people that didn't pursue that strategy, because we've been operating in places like Vietnam for close to eight years and by the time, something like this would come to fruition; we'd have a good decade or more advantaged on other people then deciding to go into those countries.","So I think part of our strategy of balancing that supply chain globally and making sure we could take advantage of things like this. Now that said, I do think that things in Washington and different governments around the world move slowly. As you said, the Congress is moving forward the fast track legislation which would be the -- what's called TPA, which gives the President the ability to go and negotiate the deal with the other countries and then bring it back for a up or down vote to Congress. So that's the first part of the process, if that does get passed sometime between now and Memorial Day, then the administration can go off and complete the negotiations with the 12 countries involved to try and put together the TPP or Trans-Pacific Partnership.","Once that's actually finalized that would then go to Congress for a vote. There is people who are optimistic that things of that could happen as early as December of 2015, there is people who think that it could take until later 2016 to actually get passed. It's Washington, things move slowly; we'll just keep an eye on it and see how it unfolds. Once it's passed, once all the countries actually would approve it, it would then be a phase-in approach over time, but as I said, we wanted to make sure we're positioned globally to take advantage of these things, and we'll have a good leapfrog on everybody else because we've been operating in those countries such as Vietnam for such a long period of time. It's a great country, it's doing very well for us, even without TPP, low cost, high-quality, we've got about 9,000 employees there and its expanding to about 12,000 over time, it\u2019s a great base for us to supply places like Europe and we feel really good about it, rolling our supply chain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.","Susan Anderson","Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on the activewear, it\u2019s one if you can maybe give a little bit more color on the weakness there. I know you talked about the new space gains don\u2019t really hit on next quarter, but -- and then you said that the mass channel is improving, but I guess what\u2019s the kind of like weighing that down given the better performance in Gear and stuff? Thanks.","Rich Noll","Sure. Activewear did grow in the quarter as you noted, driven by Gear for Sports and Hanes and we expect it to continue to accelerate its growth overall for the full year and driving that growth will be acceleration of the Champion business to a mid-single digit rate overall for the full year.","Underneath that will be strong double-digit growth within the Champion business in department, specialty and mid-tier department stores and really what we have here is, we\u2019ve gained a lot of space this year just as we did last year. Those space gains happened to be more skewed to the second quarter, whereas they were very strongly in the first quarter last year. In fact last year, our sales were up in the Champion and department stores sports specialty business about 62%, driven by a lot of placements in the first quarter. Lot of these are skewing as we get more space into the second quarter.","Next year, I think you\u2019ll see in that Champion, department and sports specialties store business double-digit growth in the second quarter and you\u2019ll see that continue throughout the year.","Susan Anderson","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on Maidenform and the improved profitability in the innerwear I guess, what percent is the 310 bps was due to Maidenform and then also, did you guys have a full quarter of that kind of flowing through the P&L or should we expect kind of like the profitability to continue to improve throughout the year?","Rick Moss","Well, I don\u2019t want to break out into too much details for the profitability of a particular segment, but that said, it was a major contributor into the profitability in the quarter along with Innovate-to-Elevate and manufacturing cost savings. The synergies from Maidenform are flowing in at or little ahead of where we thought they would be. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with how the integration plans have driven the synergy gains in Maidenform.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I guess my first question is, organic growth, kind of peel back the acquisitions, what was it in the quarter, how does that compare to where it was kind of been trending the underlying growth, the revenue growth trends and what\u2019s embedded for your full year guidance? And then I have a follow-up question as well.","RickMoss","For the first quarter, the organic growth was 1% -- 2% on a constant currency basis as we had about $13 million of FX drag in the first quarter. That was -- as we said in our prepared remarks, the first quarter came in overall right about where we thought it would be and so, you\u2019re going to see those same sorts of trends through the year as we put in our original guidance.","RichNoll","And then I think on the second part of your questions, what\u2019s embedded for the full year for organic growth in constant currency and it\u2019s 2% for the full year. So, I don\u2019t want anybody to over read sort of the ups and downs and fluctuations in the first quarter. We don\u2019t see any trend change in our business whatsoever when you\u2019re looking at sell-through. We\u2019ve always talked about things are up and down as retailers move inventory, that\u2019s all it is and I don\u2019t want to overplay it. We feel good about the overall trends in our business.","Omar Saad","And then on the -- thanks, guys, it\u2019s really helpful, Rich and Rick. And then on the innerwear margins, I mean, is that -- all that gains coming from synergies in Maidenform or is there other things going on the business that we should have our arms around?","RichNoll","I think yes and yes, right. So, this was a good quarter for Maidenform synergies, because remember, last year in that first quarter, we still had some of the SG&A, so, we\u2019re overlapping some of that, but it\u2019s also just Innovate-to-Elevate manufacturing synergies and how we\u2019re able to drive the overall business. So -- but that was an anomaly if you remember Maidenform. We still had some of those SG&A costs that we\u2019re now sort of overlapping.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good afternoon, how are you doing? Maybe a couple of questions on Maidenform here. The -- I think that\u2019s just a process, because this is one of the bigger acquisitions you have as you had geared for few years, but this is a bigger one that we\u2019ll start seeing move through your P&L.And maybe something about the steps ahead, you mentioned that I think middle of the last year, you are insourcing a lot of the products, when did those products start flowing to retail and through your cost of goods? And then, I think you\u2019re going to start pushing out some of the Innovate-to-Elevate ideas to that business as well. Is that something that you think could start some organic revenue growth for that brand and some margin expansion after you\u2019ve rebased it last year for some of the unproductive SKUs?","RichNoll","Yeah, let me take this beginning with the internalization of production. We did begin that and we began to see the benefits of that roll through the P&L this year. We\u2019re about halfway through the internationalization that we have undertaken. We\u2019ll complete the rest of it in the second half of this year, which will allow some additional synergies to roll into next year from an internaliazation standpoint.","From a standpoint of Innovate-to-Elevate and acquiring it, our first product line that we designed is actually will come to market in the fall of this year with our fall line and we\u2019re excited about that because it allows us to bring into play, for example, our ComfortFlex Fit platform that\u2019s so important to our other bra brands and bring it with a line called Fit 2 Flirt that will bring the department stores in the second half of the year and in the spring of the next year into the mass channel.","So, as we finish our brand consolidation strategy linked to our platforms and design, we think we have a real power now to unleash that the full power of Innovate-to-Elevate and drive the brand forward.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then I think you mentioned that X-Temp would double this year and maybe just back up and talk about the Innovate-to-Elevate platform a little bit. I think you\u2019ve commented in the past roughly where you are as a percent of the total portfolio that\u2019s on that platform and maybe how that mix will evolve this year. Thank you.","Rich Noll","Well, from the standpoint of our Innovate-to-Elevate platforms, you\u2019re talking about ComfortBlend and X-Temp are the ones I think you\u2019re asking. We pushed those across the basics business. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will double the space behind X-Temp this year, which gives us a lot of room to continue to grow those platforms and I think it\u2019s just exciting to us as we continue to see the upside and we pushed it not only across underwear but across our basic category with panties and into women\u2019s panties and so forth. So, tremendous success with those platforms and tremendous growth potential.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanely.","Jay Sole","Hi, good afternoon.","Rich Noll","Hi, Jay.","Jay Sole","Just curious about -- let\u2019s talk about the marketing strategy for a little bit. You can talk about the level of spend as a percentage of sales you expect to do this year and how that might be different from last year and then just in terms of what kind of vehicles you want to use to market, is it TV, is it Internet, is it mobile and then what are maybe some opportunities to flex it up or down within the year if you see different opportunities to do. Thanks.","Rich Noll","Yeah, let me just talk about that. Overall, our spending is right in line with where it\u2019s been historically. We feel really good about it. In terms of total company spend, you got to remember there are segments like the -- some of the activewear or actually like a Knights Apparel, which actually doesn\u2019t have media, so that might diluted on a total basis, but really think of it as a percentage of branded innerwear sales.","So, when you look at that from a US perspective, Jay, we\u2019re right in line with where we\u2019ve been historically. Feel good about it.Focusing a lot of our efforts on these technology platforms such as Ex-Temp that will see expand its space beginning this quarter. So, we feel really good about where we are.","In terms of mix, it has been changing over time. If you went back five years ago, predominantly it was all on TV and you\u2019re seeing that mix and digital become a larger and larger percentage each and every year and that will continue. We actually haven\u2019t talked about the specific trends but it\u2019s definitely -- it\u2019s not yet a majority, but it\u2019s more than -- it\u2019s more than a quarter.","Jay Sole","Interesting. And then, could you touch on just the ability to kind of flex it up or down if you see an opportunity that may be drive sales with something or maybe to pullback if it\u2019s unnecessary to drive more profit?","Rich Noll","We have done that historically and in fact, one of the things that we are feeling really good about our overall momentum in the total business and we see an opportunity to continue to drive and platform will increase media spend. You can do it actually in the spot market with fairly little notice if you want to use things like TV, online is also relatively easy.","And then historically, we have pulled back when we saw big things like the recession show up and we said look, at the end of the day, we need to pull back, because people weren\u2019t in the stores and so, you\u2019ve got the ability to flex it up and down with relatively little notice.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess I want to just take a quick step back and ask about your view of the European market. I assume that view would continue to evolve as you\u2019re now there in a bigger way. I guess what key learnings are coming up as you learn that innerwear market get a little bit deeper there and then how does that impact your potential decisions to enter new countries and new markets potentially through M&A or just organic growth?","Rich Noll","Sure, when we look at Europe, I think that certainly we understood going in and we still know that they\u2019re struggling with some headwinds overall in the economy. We also know that Europe is a collection of countries rather than one place. And certainly we see improvement in certain countries faster than others. In the south, for example, we are seeing nice positive trends in Spain or in Italy as we look at these economies.","The great thing is DBA\u2019s business is very much like our innerwear business here. It\u2019s a branded business. They have strong category or share positions within their categories and over time the consumer tends to buy a consistent number of units and that has been that way through the good and bad periods of the economy. And so we think we\u2019ve got a great platform which to build the business and as we execute our integration strategy, we\u2019ve got a great platform to build on.","Ike Boruchow","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Hi, guys, good afternoon. Rick, couple of questions for you on the cash flow. What are the cash charges presumed in the $550 million to $600 million net cash from operations guidance. And then the change in the GAAP guidance, is that entirely related to the addition of Knights Apparel or do you have higher expectations for charges with the Maidenform or DBA?","Rick Moss","You are talking about cash flow from operations, Jim?","Jim Duffy","Correct.","Rick Moss","Yeah. Actually the cash flow from operations guidance stayed flat and I wouldn\u2019t increase it. The Knights Apparel we believe kind of is within the ranges of what we had originally put out there. And I kind of missed the first part of your question.","Jim Duffy","So I was looking at the charges $150 million to $170 million was the guide last quarter, close to $200 million or more, what of that is cash versus non-cash? And then with respect to that change, is that entirely related to Knights Apparel or are there more charges presumed for Maidenform and DBA?","Rick Moss","It\u2019s about two-thirds cash one-third non-cash on that and the bulk of the increase was Knights Apparel. ","Jim Duffy","Okay. And then just to be clear, that cash is contemplated in the cash flow from operations, correct?","Rick Moss","Yes, absolutely. Okay, I got it. ","Rich Noll","Right. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that as we added in Knights Apparel which obviously would give you cash flow from operations for some cash charges included in that, that also helped to offset it.","Rick Moss","That\u2019s right.","Jim Duffy","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura. Bob, your line is open, could you check your mute button?","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys.","Rich Noll","Hi, how are you doing?","Bob Drbul","Good. I guess the two questions that I have, the first one is, Rich, on the inventory by one of your large retailers, I guess the thing that I struggle with is, end of March versus end of April from an inventory flex perspective, did you \u2013 I mean maybe elaborate a little bit more what you think was going on. Was it just inventory or was it like quarter end for somebody? I am just trying to get a better hand on why was it drawn down so much at that point in time.","Rich Noll","So historically you generally see inventories at retail even from a weeks of supply basis come down within their first quarter, so generally it\u2019s going to be a February, March, April timeframe. So they generally come down. This year they tended to come down lower than we've seen in a number of years as actually Gerald talked about exclusively. And I wouldn\u2019t chock it up to more than just sort of the normal trend down and either they decided they were a little bit tighter overall in inventory and so they are managing things.","Sometimes you\u2019ve got different groups starting to manage things that are new and actually we\u2019ve had system changes. A whole host of tactical reasons. There is nothing that says this was some big systemic push by this retailer to dramatically change their turns on an ongoing basis. I just chock it up to the normal fluctuation and the normal downtrend in this quarter that tended to overshoot what we\u2019ve seen historically. And now, as Gerald said, we've already started to see it reverse in April, with the first couple of weeks. So it\u2019s nothing that gives us cause for concern. It\u2019s just the normal ebbs and flow of the business.","Bob Drbul","And just a question on sort of product. Can you talk a little bit about the Tagless line, how has that been performing, what categories has that touched so far?","Rich Noll","Tagless has been with us for a decade now and it really started in the T-shirt business and we\u2019ve pushed it across not only in our innerwear T-shirts, but now certainly it\u2019s across all of our Activewear and underwear T-shirts if you will across print wear and the Champion and entire businesses we look at it. From the standpoint of bottoms, we recently couple of years ago I guess now, put Tagless into our bottoms. So it\u2019s a great example of Innovate-to-Elevate continuing to run for a long period of time, starting over a decade ago and still running strong.","Gerald Evans ","Now we will have some of the chances to do that in Europe as well.","Rich Noll","Exactly.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella","Hi. I had one clarification question on Knights or I guess seasonality question. If you look at the $160 million of revenue contribution this year, what\u2019s the seasonality on that? I am assuming it\u2019s a very different thing, your existing business because of the college year.","Rich Noll","It has a strong of back-to-school focus to it as you might imagine, so it\u2019s a fall-driven business. That\u2019s not inconsistent with some of the seasonalities of our other businesses. It\u2019s actually consistent with the seasonality.","Carla Casella ","Okay. So it was the biggest theme than the third quarter or would it be the second and prep for the fall season?","Gerald Evans","It\u2019s a similar pattern. You start to see this build towards the end of the second quarter and then peak in the early part of the third quarter and then it drops as you get into the \u2013","Rich Noll","Similar to what you would see with back-to-school kind of --","Carla Casella","Okay, and then when you include those DBA and Knights into full year, do you have an estimate of how -- what your Walmart exposure declines to or how much that would decline?","Gerald Evans ","I haven\u2019t done the calculation. ","Carla Casella","Okay. But I am assuming there is none of that because of Walmart DBA or Knights.","Rich Noll","Well, Knights we actually sell through Walmart. A sizeable piece of that goes through Walmart, yes.","Carla Casella","Okay.","Gerald Evans ","In the past that was one of the attractions as Knight has a good strong position in collegian apparel and the mass chancel and so that now allows us to cover all channels from college bookstores, mid-tier as well as the mass channel. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Yes, good afternoon everyone.","Rich Noll","Hey, Matt.","Matt McClintock","Sorry, if I missed this, because I got on a little late, but I was just wondering if you could discuss your pricing strategies in Europe, opportunities to maybe optimize price over in that region, what your efforts are doing right now in the region. And then longer-term, is that optimizing price on existing product or should we think about that more as Innovate-to-Elevate opportunity? Thank you.","Rich Noll","Sure, Matt. Let me answer a couple of elements to that question. First of all, certainly when Euro declined in value, it had a transaction impact on all companies in Europe that were sourcing offshore as they sourced in US dollars and had that transaction impact. As we noted in the last call, the Euro fell off very quickly at the end of the year and most of the pricing was set for '15, but certainly as we look toward \u201916, the best way to recover that transaction impact was through pricing and certainly we are in the early stages of developing those plans and we will be executing price increases in Europe for 2016. Certainly as we complete our integration and we work with the design teams together in Europe, we also intend to implement our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as well. And certainly that would help us optimize pricing as well.","Matt McClintock","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to T.C. Robillard for any closing comments.","T.C. Robillard","I would like to thank everyone for attending our call today and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great night.","Operator","Thank you.

For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes; Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in our businesses and Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results. I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll","Thank you, T.C. 2013 was a record year for HanesBrands in terms of sales, profitability and cash flow. Our operating profit increased $156 million, operating margins expanded 320 basis points, earnings per share grew 49% and we generated cash flow from operations of nearly $600 million. We also instituted a regularly quarter dividend, purchased Maidenform and completed our multiyear promise to reduce our long-term bond debt to $1 billion. What's even more remarkable is we accomplished all of this in a very challenging retail environment.","We built great momentum all year by remaining focused on our long-term goals and executing on the things we could control. This is most evident in the re-acceleration of Innerwear's revenue growth and the consistent double-digit margin performance in our Activewear segment.","Our Maidenform integration is also on-track and we remain confident in our ability to deliver $0.60 of incremental earnings per share within 3 years. We are fully-integrated on the front-end where our focus is on leveraging our full intimates portfolio to maximize productivity for our retail partners. All personnel decisions have been made and the impact should begin to flow through our P&L later this year and beyond.","2013 was clearly a great year, but I'd like to put our results in a broader context. When you look back over the last 5 years, which included a recession and a period of hyperinflation in cotton, since 2008, we grew sales at a compound annual growth rate of 3%. We were able to magnify that growth rate by driving our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to deliver an operating profit CAGR of 9%. And by wisely deploying our free cash flow, we were able to magnify that growth rate into an EPS CAGR of 16%. So 3% magnified to 9% and, again, to 16%. And we're not done. As we continue to execute, we see significant opportunity to drive additional leverage in our P&L for many years to come.","Looking to 2014, we are confident that the momentum we have in Innovate-to-Elevate will continue and we're reflecting that confidence by raising our EPS guidance $0.30 to a range of $4.60 to $4.80. As we look to deploy our cash flow going forward, we remain committed to our goal of delivering superior long-term shareholder returns through a combination of dividends, bolt-on acquisitions and, potentially, share repurchases. We delivered on this commitment last year and we're already off to a strong start this year with yesterday's announcement that our Board approved a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share. Our strong cash flow generation should allow us to increase the amount of cash we can return to shareholders while retaining ample flexibility to pursue other growth opportunities.","So in closing, we feel great about the momentum in our core business, and when you layer on Maidenform, we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver solid, double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich. We accomplished a lot in 2013. But I'd like to start off with a few of the highlights. First, despite an uneven consumer environment, we ended the year with a positive sales growth and an operating margin of roughly 13%, right in the middle of our long-term goal.","Second, Activewear delivered a record operating margin of 13.1%, up 750 basis points from last year, a remarkable achievement and one that underscores the benefits of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy.","Third, we took advantage of our strong profit position to further strengthen our brands by investing an incremental $35 million in media.","And fourth, we added Maidenform to our brand portfolio.","We finished the year with strong momentum across the entire business. For the quarter, revenue, excluding Maidenform, increased 3% over last year and 4% on a constant currency basis. This exceeded the high-end of our prior outlook, which in turn drove upside in both our operating profit and earnings for the quarter.","Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is firing on all cylinders and we expect this momentum to carry through 2014. Looking at the individual components, our brand power has enabled us to take low to mid-single digit price increases this year in several key categories that we expect will offset inflationary pressures and maintain our margins. It is becoming increasingly clear that apparel is in a moderate inflationary environment where it is critical to have strong brands to be able to offset these pressures. We continue to see success across all of our innovation platforms as they are driving results for our retail partners. In our supply chain, we expect efficiency to remain at current run rates for 2014 as platform volume increases and we continue to focus on four-wall profitability. As Maidenform's production is integrated into our supply chain, we would expect these efficiencies to increase in 2015 and beyond.","Before I get into our segments, I'd like to provide an update on overall retail trends. Our results have varied by retailer. Point of sales trends were generally positive in October and November. In December, some retailers performed well prior to Christmas, while others were better after Christmas. Moving into January, there have been good weeks and bad weeks driven by the weather. We expect this type of uneven environment to continue through 2014. However, we feel very good about the annual consistency of our categories and our strong consumer franchise.","Turning to our segments, I'd like to start with Innerwear, where revenue growth, excluding Maidenform, accelerated to mid-single digits in the quarter. This was led by our Basics group, which was up high-single digits in the quarter with strong performance in men's underwear and socks.","Looking into 2014, ComfortBlend and X-TEMP continue to perform very well and are helping drive space gains. We are also taking the next step with X-TEMP by launching the technology across multiple product categories.","The intimates group also finished the year strong, with sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. Panties grew low-double digits while bras were up mid-single digits. During the quarter, our classics bras performed better than our contemporary bras, mirroring the trend in the overall market.","Our Smart Sizes innovation platform continued to perform well, and for the year, point-of-sale at retail was up double digits.","With respect to Maidenform, the integration is progressing on-plan. Shortly after closing, we went to market with our key retailers to begin refining assortments and positioning with our full portfolio of classic and contemporary brands, and the response from our retail partners has been uniformly positive.","For the quarter, Innerwear margins declined from last year due to the substantial increase in media investments, which was used to support campaigns for Hanes underwear and panties. We expect our media investments to increase approximately $10 million to $15 million in 2014 as we continue to support our brands and begin making investments behind Maidenform brands.","Turning to Activewear, we are very pleased with the team's improvement in profitability over the course of the year. Operating profit increased nearly $100 million from last year, bringing its full year operating margin to 13.1%. We achieved this new level of margin growth by driving our platform innovations, focusing on branded categories and internalizing production of large core programs. On an annual basis, Activewear has reached a new level of sustainable profitability.","Champion grew high-single digits in the quarter and mid-single digits for the full year. Incremental space gains should position Champion for continued growth as we go through 2014. And Gear For Sports also had a nice quarter, with sales up low-single digits and operating profit up double digits.","Switching to International. On a constant currency basis, sales in the quarter, excluding Maidenform, were up 4% and operating profit was up 11%. Currency remained a headwind, taking roughly 10 percentage points of growth off the segment and a full percentage point of growth off total company sales for the quarter. As we look at 2014, we expect growth in our International business, driven by the addition of Maidenform, which will more than offset the expected currency headwinds.","And finally, our Direct to Consumer business had a very strong year, with operating profit up 34%. With the inclusion of Maidenform, we look forward to driving profitable growth in this segment for many years to come.","So to wrap up, our core business is stronger than it's ever been. Profitability is up significantly and we continue to gain market share. 2013 was a great year, but it was just the beginning. Our brands are strong, we believe we are set to expand our sales space at retail and we are confident the momentum in our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy can continue. And all of this together positions us for an even better year in 2014.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss","Thanks, Gerald. I'm very pleased with our record financial performance in 2013 as we consistently delivered strong results all year. We generated nearly $600 million in cash flow from operations, which we used to drive both current and future returns for our shareholders. We returned nearly $60 million in cash through regular quarterly dividends and invested for future growth with the acquisition of Maidenform. With high levels of sustainable cash flow and a continued focus on effectively deploying our cash, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver outsized returns for many years to come.","The fourth quarter marked another milestone for HanesBrands as we made the final prepayment on our 8% senior notes, thereby achieving the commitment we made 2 years ago to reduce our bond debt to $1 billion by the end of 2013, another example of how focused we are on driving long-term shareholder returns and doing what we say we'll do.","Before I review our financial results, I want to highlight that any reference to our consolidated actual results or guidance will be on an ex-a [ph] basis and will exclude all onetime charges and expenses. Now, let me give you some color on our strong fourth quarter results.","Sales in the quarter were $1.3 billion, up approximately 12% versus prior year. Maidenform accounted for 9 percentage points of this growth, while the rest of the business grew 3%.","Gross margin of 34.5% was flat with last year. But excluding Maidenform, gross margins improved by about 40 basis points.","SG&A spending increased $46 million over last year due to an incremental $18 million in media spending and the addition of Maidenform's business. Excluding both of these items, SG&A dollars were flat with last year.","Operating profit of $152 million was essentially flat with last year. Our operating profit margin was 11.9%, as Maidenform weighed on margins by approximately 90 basis points.","Interest and other expense for the quarter totaled approximately $42 million, including the $15 million prepayment penalty related to the retirement of the final $250 million of our 8% senior notes and approximately $3 million in interest on the additional borrowings associated with the Maidenform acquisition.","EPS for the quarter was $0.98, above the high-end of our guidance range due to a-better-than-expected sales increase during the quarter.","Switching briefly to the full year. We delivered 4 very solid quarters of operating results. Sales, including Maidenform, were slightly over $4.6 billion, a 2% increase over last year.","Revenue grew approximately 1.5% for the year when excluding Maidenform, currency headwinds of $40 million and planned reductions in branded printwear sales of $25 million.","Operating profit of $596 million was $156 million above last year's level, resulting in an operating margin of roughly 13%, right in the middle of our long-term goal of 12% to 14%.","EPS was $3.91, an increase of 49% over last year.","For the year, we generated $591 million in cash flow from operations driven by profit growth and further improvements in working capital, primarily in inventory.","Inventory, excluding Maidenform, ended the year down roughly $100 million due almost entirely to a 13% decline in units as we continued to focus on improving inventory turns.","Net capital expenditures for the year were approximately $38 million, resulting in free cash flow of $554 million.","I'd now like to spend some time on our guidance for 2014. But before I get into the details, I'd like to highlight 2 assumptions. First, our guidance assumes that the overall retail environment remains challenging. Second, and more importantly, our guidance reflects our confidence in the ability of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to continue its momentum into 2014.","We expect our 2014 full-year sales to be slightly less than $5.1 billion, with approximately $500 million coming from Maidenform.","Operating profit is expected to be $640 million to $660 million, including approximately $25 million from Maidenform. This implies just under 100 basis points of operating margin dilution from Maidenform.","Interest and other related expense is expected to be approximately $85 million, including approximately $10 million from the higher debt balances associated with the Maidenform acquisition.","We estimate that our full-year tax rate will be in the low-teens, with slightly higher rates in the first half of the year.","Given the strong momentum in our business, we've raised our EPS range to $4.60 to $4.80. Our guidance is assuming a fully diluted share count of slightly more than 103 million.","This year, we're shifting our guidance from free cash flow to cash flow from operations. We expect cash flow from operations to be $450 million to $550 million for the full year.","Net capital expenditures are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million, while annual dividend payments are estimated to be roughly $120 million.","In closing, we had a very strong year. Investors are finally seeing the level of earnings and cash flow that our business model can deliver, and this is just the beginning. As we continue to execute our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and invest our free cash flow, we see significant opportunity to drive additional profitability for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the fourth quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great execution in a really tough environment. So let me just go right to that, Rich. Maybe just speak to, again, what you're seeing in retail. Obviously, a lot of noise out there in terms of the challenging traffic, particularly in the mass channel, yet you deliver a 3% Innerwear business in the quarter. Obviously, Innovate-to-Elevate has a lot to do with that. But just really speak to what -- how you guys are differentiating, how you're driving despite that tough environment.","Richard A. Noll","I think you actually hit the nail on the head. This is all about Innovate-to-Elevate, and we were seeing the benefits all through 2013 and you saw those benefits accrue also in the fourth quarter, and we feel really good about the momentum we're carrying into '14. The other thing is, with our categories, we've got some volatility in the short term. It can be up, it can be down. But over time, what's really going to drive your business is how well your brands and your product innovation resonate with the consumer, and because of the replenishment nature of our business, we're able to sort of smooth out some of those ups and downs over the long-term. So we feel really good about things.","Eric A. Alexander - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, and then I guess my follow-up then is as it sets off into '14, raising the bar here on the guidance despite the tough environment, clearly, you guys have to have comfortability. Again, maybe just walk through -- is it just -- is it the Innovate-to-Elevate on the top line? In the space gains you see, are there kind of structural sort of margin things at play that give you greater confidence? Or is it the incremental coming out of last quarter to this that gives you the confidence to raise?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, so there's really 2 fundamental reasons why we're taking our guidance up for 2014. And first and foremost, we just have a lot of visibility about 2014 right now. As Gerald said, we've instituted some price increases and so they're locked in and set. We've got most of our promotion plans laid out all the way through back-to-school, so we feel good from that perspective. We have good understanding of what our space gains look like for the first 3 quarters of the year. And in fact, our commodity costs are already locked in through almost all the way through the third quarter. We've also got our integration plans set with Maidenform and we're executing well. So you wrap all that up and you've got good visibility. And then the other thing is, as you just pointed out, we've also got good momentum in our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy. And on top of the 320-basis points margin improvement we just saw in operating margins, implied in our guidance is another 50 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2014 in our core business when you tease out Maidenform. So you put those 2 factors together and we felt it was the right thing to do, to take our guidance up for 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Rich, I was wondering if you could focus in on a little bit on Activewear and specifically, Champion. You talked about visibility into 2014. What type of visibility do you have in the Champion business? Are you getting space gains there? What's driving that business? And then when -- Gerald, you made the comment that the Activewear operating margin has reached a new sustainable level. Can you maybe walk us through what makes you feel comfortable with making a statement like that and where that business is operating at, which, clearly, it's operating at one of the best levels it's been in years?","Richard A. Noll","Yes, Matt, I'll just talk to the -- Champion is doing extremely well and Innovate-to-Elevate is what's driving the margin. So let me just turn it over to Gerald to let him give you more specifics.","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, Matt, when you ask about sustainability, the level and so forth, it's a great example of Innovate-to-Elevate. We spent a couple of years really remixing that business away from commodity-oriented segments to where brand -- to the branded segments where brand really mattered, and we could then apply our innovation behind our powerful brands, integrate some of those products into our supply chain and drive that margin. That business has accomplished that, reaching that level of 13.1% margin, which we do believe is sustainable as we've got it now to this branded sort of a level of business model, and now, we're going to drive it, and Champion's the brand we're going to drive it behind with innovations. We've got a number of innovations coming through such as our Vapor products, we've got a marathon bra product coming through that we're gaining space, we're adding space in new retailers as well as where we are. So we've got a lot of momentum in that business right now.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So if I may, if I could try to quantify that or get some color around that. Innovate-to-Elevate clearly has been driving your businesses in Innerwear for several years. What inning would you say that you're in, in terms of driving Innovate-to-Elevate strategy within the Activewear business?","Richard A. Noll","It's hard to quantify that. The good thing is we took a quantum leap forward in 2013 with Activewear, as you saw us go from those single-digit operating margins, now to double digits; they had a phenomenal year. You can expect that to continue. And I don't want to try and quantify the -- what inning, but we're clearly closer to the beginning of it than we are to the end. And I just think it just is a testament to how well Innovate-to-Elevate is working. And as we graft it onto other pieces of our business and now to the acquisition of Maidenform, that it can continue to pay dividends.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk about -- you just mentioned on the Activewear category, but any other new product innovations you have coming down the pipeline for '14. And then are you planning -- it sounds like X-TEMP is performing well, the no-size bras, ComfortBlend, are those going to be rolled out to other areas for this year, too?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes, we are definitely -- Susan, this is Gerald. We're definitely going to continue to build on our big innovation platforms. And the beauty of them is ComfortBlend's a perfect example of the success on underwear. We extended it in the socks, and it's been even more successful. We -- our Smart Sizes continues to grow double digits and POS, as you saw, it represents roughly 1\/3 of our core bra sales today. So we see the opportunity as we take Maidenform and put our Innovate-to-Elevate into that down the road that we can bring Smart Sizes, for example, into the Maidenform brand as well. And then certainly, X-TEMP, we view as a technology, a temperature-regulating technology that -- it has been successful in the limited area as it is, and we intend to expand it across multiple categories and multiple accounts as we go forward.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I can't -- I don't remember if you -- did you quantify the benefit to margin from Innovate-to-Elevate this quarter? And then back to the Activewear, too, really quick. Just the good margins that we're seeing there, how much should I think about it being kind of just a move away from that commodity stuff and then how much of it, the Innovate-to-Elevate?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. Susan, this is Rick. The Innovate-to-Elevate accounted -- we talked about 40 basis points of margin improvement, excluding Maidenform. That was really -- that was all Innovate-to-Elevate. What we saw with respect to cotton and other commodities was cotton was a -- it was a modest benefit to us in the quarter, but was offset by expected inflation and other inputs. And so, really, that didn't have much of an impact. So it was really all Innovate-to-Elevate.","Richard A. Noll","Yes, and this is Rich, if I may just expand on that Innovate-to-Elevate in the margin. We've been seeing 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement from Innovate-to-Elevate starting in Q4 of '12. So we've now just overlapped that and then had the 40 basis points improvement in this Q4 '13 as well. So we feel really, really good. In terms of the split on Activewear, how much of that is getting out of a low-margin business and how much of it is Innovate-to-Elevate driving margins, I think the lion's share of it is Innovate-to-Elevate.","Richard D. Moss","Yes, exactly. It is.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about maybe the pricing unit dynamics. That's a key question I get a lot of the time. You mentioned you've taken some pricing and a lot of it is said, I believe, at this point for 2014. What's happening with units? If you could comment on that, that would be great.","Richard A. Noll","We went through 2011 and we were raising -- we raised price 3x in some of those basic categories double digits. And in -- and I think cumulatively, there were some categories where we were up over 30%. And in all cases, even with those kind of price increases, units fell off at a smaller rate than prices went up. So the elasticity was always less than 1. Now, what we're talking about is radically different. We're talking about low-single-digit, maybe mid-single-digit increases in those categories. So if it was less than 1 and a double-digit price increases, you're clearly going to see probably even a more muted impact overall. But at the end of the day, we feel really good about our overall business moving into '14.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great. The other question is, you mentioned some of the margin improvement in Active internalizing production of the large core programs. Is there more opportunity of that in 2014?","Gerald W. Evans","Absolutely. We're consistently looking for opportunities to bring more programs inside and we will continue to do that in Activewear as well as the other portions of our business, including our new Maidenform acquisition.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions around the outlook. As we look into '14 and perhaps even beyond, looking into '14, what are the expectations for price and volumes assumed in the guidance? Are you expecting a net falloff in unit volumes overcome by price?","Richard A. Noll","Jim, we just generally just don't get to that level of detail when it comes to guidance. When you're talking about overall units, you're adding units of socks, say, units of bras and so and so. And we actually are looking at units, we actually have to look into the much lower level of detail than in aggregate for the total company.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And you continue to find opportunity in your tax works. What is the source of the year-to-year tax improvement implied in the guidance, Rick? And how sustainable should we think of that rate being?","Richard D. Moss","Well, it's interesting, Jim. If you look at our tax rate over the last 4 or 5 years, it's been -- it's averaged around 13%. The -- and we think there's no reason why acquisitions shouldn't enable us to, going forward as we integrate them into our supply chain both from a manufacturing and sourcing perspective, shouldn't enable us to sustain a tax rate in the low to mid-teens, really, for the foreseeable future.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It sounds like you made a lot of progress with your inventory this year in the reduction of units. Can you tell us how much more room you have to go with that and what the goal is for your inventory turn?","Richard D. Moss","Sure, Kate. We did see a 13% reduction in units, down $100 million. Our expectation that's kind of built into our cash flow guidance for this year is that working capital in general probably will be fairly flat, though, obviously, on a higher level of sales, that's an improvement. So that puts us, really, this year, it puts us at about 2.5 turns. We continue to believe we can move towards 3 turns. So we're not done yet.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And with regards to Maidenform, now that you've been -- the deal has closed about 3 months, can you highlight any positive or negative surprises within the Maidenform business and where you think some of the low-hanging fruit opportunity is in terms of revenue upside?","Richard A. Noll","Sure. In fact, I think that's a great opportunity, sort of let us give you a sort of a broad view on sort of some of the good things throughout the synergies, not just revenue, but also cost and so on. We've now, as you said, have owned it for about 120 days, so we're intimately involved in the business. And it is crystal clear that the strategic rationale for this acquisition remains very compelling. Just to recap, and originally, we talked about 2014 needing to shrink it down to its core profitable base, getting it to around $500 million in sales, and that's inherent in our guidance. And we also talked about $0.10 to $0.15 of accretion to EPS in this first year. And when you look at that $25 million of operating profit, that actually translates into the higher end of that guidance of around $0.15. And the good thing is, if we've got some upside -- actually, I do think we may have some upside to that number in 2014. We're also talking about growing that $25 million to $80 million of operating profit over time, driven by SG&A synergies, supply chain synergies and then grafting Innovate-to-Elevate onto their business. And we feel really good about that. But let me turn it over to Rick and then Gerald to talk about some specific anecdotes there. Rick?","Richard D. Moss","Sure. As Rich said, the integration of Maidenform into our organization is going very well and is progressing right on plan. We currently expect about half of the cost savings to come from SG&A synergies. The key drivers, which is about a 40% reduction in the overall headcount at Maidenform, we would expect about 60% of this reduction to take place by the middle of this year, with the remaining headcount reductions coming towards the end of September. So you should begin to see the full impact of SG&A savings beginning in the fourth quarter and then into 2015. Now, if that integration process goes faster, then you have an opportunity to see profit improvement, like Rich referred to, probably in as much as the $5 million to $7 million range. Gerald?","Gerald W. Evans","Yes. The other half of our cost savings comes from integrating Maidenform into our supply chain. We're right on-track there as well. We've already integrated the direct -- oversight of management of supply chain into our supply chain management. We're now taking steps to integrate the first of the production into our supply chain beginning into Q3 of 2014. And the savings will rollout in the P&L in 2015 just as we had planned. From a top line perspective, those plans are taking shape just as we thought as well. As Rich mentioned, our plans were to reshape the Maidenform revenue in 2014 down to around $500 million as we expected to exit a number of non-core, unprofitable sales, as well as we did expect some declines in shapewear sales as Spanx extended its distribution. And this is playing out exactly as we thought it would in 2014 and it's now giving us a very solid sales base against which we can grow sales and profits over time. And I'm very excited about the potential of that as we look to graft on our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy and drive sales and we're already making progress there. We've integrated our 2 design organizations into one. We've integrated the market of Maidenform into our brand marketing teams and they're already finding opportunities. They are working diligently on platform innovations for the Maidenform brand that will launch in late 2015. So I'd say, overall, we feel great about the Maidenform acquisition, and what it will contribute in sales and margins both in 2014 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik from BB&T Capital Markets.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So you spoke about last quarter, I think, that you saw actually more de-stocking than usual in September. Do you think that led retailers to de-stock less than you expected in December? And generally, how do retailers feel about carrying the inventory in your Basics category?","Gerald W. Evans","I think certainly, Scott -- this is Gerald. I think coming out of back-to-school week, we did have a little bit of an inventory carry. There was some de-stocking in September. Now we viewed the -- with caution what the landmark or the retail landscape might be like for the holiday season. We did not see additional de-stocking as we went into the holiday period and our POS trends were pretty good in October and December, so we feel like we came through it pretty well and, certainly, that helped with our momentum that we didn't have de-stocking.","Richard A. Noll","In terms of going forward, what's interesting is that there's a couple of phenomenas. While you're hearing some retailers being soft and so on and so forth, we don't see a broad theme at retail where they feel like their overall inventories are high. It doesn't feel like they're trying to -- and this is not just our basic categories -- are across-the-board. I think some of that's, obviously, just to the fact of all the cold weather that they're clearly getting some good sell-through on their cold weather gear, and that's reducing their -- the overall pressure they may feel in terms of inventories. And our inventories at retail feel like they're pretty well in line.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Awesome. Okay. And then can you just lay out a little bit of a timeframe for when you need to start to actually add manufacturing capacity to meet the new volume demands in the next couple of years?","Gerald W. Evans","We're really in the process of ramping capacity now to begin to bring in Maidenform in Q3 and we're constantly reassessing our capacity. So we're in the process of looking in that over a longer range period now.","Scott D. Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Is the CapEx that you laid out for '14, is that a reasonable assumption for the year after, or the next couple of years?","Richard A. Noll","Yes. We've actually talked about, I think we're talking about $60 million to $70 million of CapEx. Remember, our strategy was we were spending above depreciation and amortization for a number of years as we recapitalized the supply chain. We said that would allow us to get down to that $40 million to $50 million level for a couple of years, and then you would expect it to start to float up back towards depreciation and amortization beginning in '14. And so that's the $60 million to $70 million. And that should allow us to easily continue to drive efficiencies in the supply chain and support growth through the Innovate-to-Elevate, as well absorbing the Maidenform acquisition. Over the long-term, you should expect that capital expenditure should ultimately equal depreciation, amortization, not to be a source or use of cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from CL King & Associates.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In the past, you've spoken about $30 million to $40 million worth of supply chain efficiencies on an annual basis, that was the 3-year plan about 3 years ago. Is that still in place over the course of 2014, 2015? Can supply chain efficiencies still hit those levels, or you are you pretty much done there?","Richard A. Noll","When you talk about Innovate-to-Elevate, remember, there are 3 distinct pieces of that strategy. And one is leveraging our brand power, the second is driving platform innovation and the third is using our supply chain as an integral part of all of that to help improve operating margins. So on some of this -- this is why we stopped talking about just cost savings from the supply chain alone because a lot of it's integrated with Innovate-to-Elevate. So as we drive platform innovation, that builds volumes and certain basic SKUs which allows you to then internalize it and drive your overall unit cost down. So it's all caught up in that Innovate-to-Elevate. So I don't want to talk about it as a separate distinct thing, it's really part of our overall strategy. That said, it's an integral part of improving margins. It's what's been helping Activewear as we've internalized some of those bigger programs, help improve margins. So we will continue to be an integral part of us expanding margins with Innovate-to-Elevate forever.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I understand. And I believe, Gerald, you mentioned early on the call regarding incremental media spend next year. You mentioned it during the Innerwear section. Was that specifically Innerwear or that was consolidated? And as a follow-up, can you talk about what the aggregate media spend is across the company on a -- roughly, on a annual basis?","Gerald W. Evans","I did mention that we would increase our media by another $10 million to $15 million next year, that's correct, over the $35 million that we added this you. The majority of our media spend is in Innerwear, so it's likely that the fair portion of that will go into the Innerwear group. But we do intend to support our Activewear brands as well and we also intend to support the Maidenform brands, specifically, as we look into this year.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Total media [indiscernible].","Richard A. Noll","The total -- at this point, as others are starting to spend media in these categories, we want to be a little more cautious about talking about our total media spend, although we are talking about the increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chad Sutherland from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Taposh Bari at Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask, Rich, I know you touched about the macro environment. I wanted to ask you just more high-level, about a lot of negative pre-announcements, a lot of questions about kind of structural changes in the way the consumer is shopping. You sell, obviously, to a wide range of channels and customers. Just wanted to get your view, not on a monthly basis, but just generally speaking, what you're seeing if you are in fact seeing kind of secular shifts in the way the consumer is shopping that's, in fact, disrupting your business, if at all.","Richard A. Noll","Well, in terms of it disrupting our business, we had a great 2013 and we feel good about 2014. However, as Rick said, inherent in our guidance is we are expecting this choppy consumer spending environment to continue. And when you tease it out and take out Maidenform, you'll see we're actually talking about our core business being up about 1.5 points and actually, we're reflecting that sort of choppiness, I think, in that guidance. There's mixed signals about what's going on out there. In one hand, you hear the Fed is talking about things are good and there's other areas outside of the core retail that are doing really well with consumer spending. You're hearing isolated instances about certain retailers having traffic issues. You got stuff going on from bricks and mortar to online and all of that stuff out there. The great thing about our business and our categories is that people buy our products and wear our products every single day of their lives and they're going to continue to buy them over the long-term, and that's why we feel really good about being able to navigate a relatively choppy environment. There's no real macro trends that we're seeing, it's more episodical, and a lot of it driven by the weather. We should be relatively insulated from a long-term perspective.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then the other question I had that we get frequently from investors is as you execute along this strategy of innovating to elevating, I guess, how confident are you in your ability to kind of maintain that margin and keep that margin to yourselves versus having to share that with your retail partners?","Richard A. Noll","We -- I think a testament to how strongly we believe in the sustainability of our overall profit and our ability to generate cash flow is the fact that we took our dividend up 50% yesterday to $0.30 a share. And that is really because of the nature of our categories, how well our business is operating and our believability in what it's going to look like into the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up if I could. Rich, in terms of the competitive landscape, any changes that you're seeing there? There's always some new entrants, brands developing, that are trying to take share. Anything from -- be it a pricing perspective or just general advertising marketing spend that you feel like stepping up? Anything from -- on the competitive landscape front?","Richard A. Noll","There's been a lot of talk about some of our large competitors making entry into large mass retailers with their own labels and how that might impact our business. When you look at our Basics business, it's in really good shape. It was up in the fourth quarter, it was up in all of 2013. And then when you look at it on a share perspective, according to NPD scanner share data, on a rolling 6-month basis, after we've seen those entries, on a rolling 6-month basis ending December, our shares are actually up 0.6 point. So we feel really good about how well our brands and our innovation is resonating with consumers.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","That's great. And then if I could just a quick one, too, on -- so the raised dividend obviously speaks to your confidence in the fundamentals of the business. As we think about capital allocation, I think you were pretty clear in the release in stating this, but maybe just walk us through any changes to that allocation to potential acquisitions, some of these tuck-in plays in the future. And then if you can, any update on where those assets might lie and the timeframe [indiscernible] of the timing, but just how that might play out?","Richard A. Noll","As we talked about capital allocation, we've got our debt leverage in the target range that we want it to be. And then we've said after that, we wanted to have a priority of dividends. Just given our business model, that makes a lot of sense. We instituted it last year it and we've now got it solidly in our target range of 25% to 30% payout ratio. That still leaves us ample cash flow to actually pursue bolt-on acquisitions or potentially share repurchases. And when you look at things like Maidenform, I think it's a great way for us to use our cash flow to create value for our retailers. We're constantly on the lookout for other things like that. I always tell people that we're always talking to people that it takes a long time to do a deal, and when we finally get one, we'll let you know. But clearly, as we look for opportunities, that's going to be our priority. But don't minimize share repurchases. They're also on the radar screen. And I think when you look back out over a 5 to 10 year period of time, you're going to see dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, all part of that capital allocation to create value for shareholders.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

We delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by strong Champion performance, growth in all geographies and successful product innovation. Revenue, operating profit and earnings per share were at the high end of our guidance range. And we generated $137 million of operating cash flow. For the full year, we believe we are on track to achieve the midpoint of our guidance or higher given our first half momentum and second half visibility, including Champion bookings growth, our international strength and additional innovation launches in innerwear. ","Several years ago, we put in place strategies to generate more consistent organic revenue growth and optimize the benefits of our company owned supply chain, and these strategies are working. Our second quarter results, as well as our outlook for the second half show our continued steady progress in unlocking our full cash flow potential, and ultimately enhancing shareholder returns. ","Our diversification strategy and increased brand related investments are delivering more consistent organic growth. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased approximately 5% in the quarter and the growth was broad based across businesses and geographies. Activewear revenue increased more than 10%. International sales were up over 10% driven by innerwear growth in both Europe and Australia, as well as continued growth in Champion. Consumer directed revenue which we define as our branded stores and all online channels increased 12%. And global Champion revenue excluding C9 increased by more than 50% despite tougher comparisons, driven by continuous strength in both Champion innerwear and activewear products. ","Champion's second quarter growth was 10 percentage points higher than our expectation. And this marks the eighth consecutive quarter that global Champion strong double-digit growth has been at or above 30%. Revenue in our US Innerwear business was in line with our forecast. We were encouraged by innerwear's performance in the quarter, particularly the sequential improvement in our intimates business as our new innovations continued to build momentum.","Looking forward, we believe we're a well positioned to continue to drive organic growth across Innerwear and Activewear globally. Our investments in growth related initiatives are generating strong results. Therefore, we're investing an additional $7 million this year to further build on our revenue momentum. Within our Global Innerwear business, we're stepping up our investment and increasing our innovation activity, as we drive to return innerwear to long-term growth.","We're increasing brand related investments in both the US and internationally. And we've ramped our innovate to elevate strategy with a number of innovation launches scheduled in the second half. Let me take a few minutes to give you some insights on our exciting innovations around the world that we believe will further strengthen our Global Innerwear business. In US sentiments, we have a number of bronze shaper initiatives in place. In bras, our new innovation called green wire eliminates the discomfort of an underwire without sacrificing support. We've seen positive consumer response to the recent launch in our Hanes and Maidenform brands.","We also recently launched our easy light innovation, which is a lighter weight bra designed to act and feel like a second skin. Easy light is exceeding our initial expectations. And will continue to expand distribution in our Bali Brown this quarter with plan launches in fall 2019 and spring 2020 under our Hanes and Maidenform brands respectively.","In addition, we're expanding our successful cool comfort innovation to all Maidenform shapewear products this year. In US Basics, we're extending our successful comfort flex fit innovation in women's panties. And in men's underwear and socks, we're launching our enhanced X-TEMP which provides improved cooling and working performance.","Looking internationally, in Europe, we're introducing a compression innovation in deem hosiery. And in Australia, we're launching X temp and bonds underwear, as well as expanding our rapidly growing bras and things consumer direct business, including store openings in new countries. As you can see, we have an exciting global pipeline of innovation that we believe will further strengthen our global innerwear business.","Turning to Champion, we're seeing continued strength globally in both our activewear and innerwear businesses. In the first half, we exceeded our expectations in both the first and second quarter with broad based growth across geographies and across channels. We have great visibility to our second half bookings that is expected are up double digits globally. And looking forward, we anticipate continued growth coming from expansion in current customers, as well as additional points of distribution. As an example of incremental distribution, in China, we recently added a second distribution partner that will accelerate the expansion of Champion branded stores and our online presence beginning in 2020.","We believe we're still in the early stages of Champion's long-term growth opportunity. Based on our performance to date and our second half visibility, we expect global Champion sales excluding C9 to be in excess of $1.8 billion this year.","Now turning to our overall outlook for the back half of the year. We believe we're well positioned for continued organic growth, as well as margin expansion. We've got our price increases in place. We're ahead of schedule on improving US Activewear's profitability as we remix to higher margin products. And we expect to deliver additional synergies from our Australian acquisitions.","Looking beyond this year, we remain on track with our actions to reduce overhead within our Western Hemisphere supply chain network. As a result, we believe we're well positioned to generate higher levels of operating cash flow. In the quarter, we generated $137 million of cash flow from operations, which was more than double last year. On a year-to-date basis, we re ahead of last year's level and we're on track to deliver on our cash flow guidance, which at the midpoint reflects 17% growth over last year.","So in closing, we had another strong quarter. Our geographic diversification is creating value. Our product innovation is working and Champion's growth continues to outperform. Given our first-half momentum and our second-half visibility, we believe we're well positioned to achieve the midpoint of our guidance or higher for the full year.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry Hytinen","Thanks Gerald. Overall, our second quarter results were at the high end of our guidance ranges for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. For the quarter, sales were $1.76 billion, an increase of $45 million over last year. Adjusted operating profit increased 1% over last year to $247 million. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.45 and $0.42 respectively. And cash flow from operations was $137 million.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 2.7% over last year despite a $34 million headwind from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, sales in the quarter were up 4.6% over last year. Adjusted gross margin of 39% was consistent with prior year and our outlook as the contributions from pricing and higher Champion margins offset higher input costs and the significant negative impact from foreign exchange.","On a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our gross margin was up 20 basis points over last year. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $247 million. This included $4 million of currency headwinds and approximately $12 million of growth related investments as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 14% was in line with the high end of our guidance range. For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges of $13 million were better than our guidance and our tax rate of 14.1% was in line with our forecast. Adjusted earnings per share $0.45 were consistent with prior year, while GAAP earnings per share increased 8% to $0.42. ","Now let me take you through our segment performance. US Innerwear sales were in line with our guidance down 2% compared to last year. For the quarter, Basics revenue declined 2% while the intimate's revenue decline of 3% improved sequentially reflecting the traction we're seeing with our multi-year revitalization plan. Within our intimates business, shapewear delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth driven by our new product designs and innovation. While the decline in cross sales was consistent with our outlook. For the quarter, Innerwear's operating margin of 22% was in line with our expectation. The 90 basis point decline compared to prior year was driven by lower volume and investments to support our brands, as our recent price increases offset higher commodity costs.","US Activewear's performance was strong in the quarter with sales up 10.5% and profit up nearly 20% as compared to last year. Champion activewear sales excluding C9 increased over 50% and were higher than our forecast. The growth was driven by comps and space expansion at existing accounts, new distribution as well as growth in the consumer directed bookstore and distributor channels. C9 revenue increased more than 8% in the quarter ahead of our expectation for a decline, driven by strong sell-through. As we've discussed before, we're focused on remixing parts of our activewear business to branded products, which drives improving margins.","Therefore sales in the remainder of our activewear segments declined in the quarter as we exited commodity programs in the mass channel. Activewear's operating margin increased 120 basis points to 15.3%. The strong margin performance was driven by improved Champion profitability, favorable contribution from our remix inactivity and pricing, partially offset by significantly higher levels of investments to support our growth initiatives.","In our International segment, sales increased 4% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10.5% or $57 million. With strong performances in innerwear and activewear, we delivered double-digit growth in Europe and Asia and high single-digit growth in Australia. International's operating margin increased approximately 20 basis points over last year to 14.3%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which internationals operating margin was above the corporate average, as we continue to benefit from volume driven leverage and acquisition synergies.","A key call-out for me and the results is that through the first half, we have grown sales and profits in each of our international regions, Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. That's both on a constant currency basis and a reported basis.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated $137 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of 114% compared to last year. The growth was driven by improved working capital performance and higher GAAP net income. Consistent with our strategy, our team is focused on driving higher levels of cash generation and reducing debt. In the quarter, the team drove a five-day improvement on our cash cycle over last year. And on a sequential basis, we reduced our inventory balance and our net debt.","Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.5x down from last year's 3.9x. We're on track to lower our leverage to 2.9x by the end of the year.","And now turning to guidance. I'll point you to our press release and FAQ document for more details. However, I would like to share a few thoughts to frame our outlook. Today, we issued third quarter guidance which at the midpoint implies total sales growth of approximately 1.5% on a constant currency basis or up slightly on a reported basis. Our guidance reflects nearly $20 million of currency headwind in the third quarter. And as we've previously discussed, in the second half, we project our activewear segment will be impacted by the planned wind down of C9 and the exit of commodity programs in the mass Channel.","Adjusting for this, our third quarter guidance at the midpoint implies total company sales growth of approximately 3% and constant currency sales growth in excess of 4%. With respect to our segments, the midpoint of our third quarter revenue guidance assumes a 2% decline in our US Innerwear segment unchanged from our prior outlook. In US Activewear, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance assumes revenue is consistent year-over-year, reflecting high-teens growth in Champion excluding C9.","For the remainder of our Activewear segment, our guidance assumes a year-over-year decline of approximately 12% or $40 million. Adjusting for the wind down of C9 and the exited businesses, our third quarter guidance implies activewear growth of over 8%.","I'll note our activewear assumptions are consistent with our previous guidance; however, our momentum in Champion has consistently outperformed our expectations across the first half of the year. In our International segment, the midpoint of our guidance assumes reported sales growth of approximately 3.5% and constant currency sales growth approaching 7%. Our third quarter operating profit range is $276 million to $286 million. At the midpoint, our guidance implies a $3 million increase as compared to prior year. Recall in third quarter last year, our results included a charge related to the Sears bankruptcy which was partially offset by variable compensation adjustments.","As we previously discussed in the back half and in the third quarter, we anticipate Activewear's operating margin to continue to expand driven by the growth in Champion and the remixing activity we've discussed. Our guidance reflects approximately $13 million of increased brand support and growth related investments including the additional $7 million that Gerald mentioned. Therefore, our full year outlook reflects an approximate $32 million increase year-over-year in growth related investments, as compared to our prior outlook of $25 million.","Our third quarter operating profit guidance also includes higher levels of variable compensation and a $3 million headwind from exchange rates. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $54 million. This is below our first half trend as we anticipate lower interest expense in the second half due to a cross currency swap we put in place in July, lower borrowing rates and higher levels of cash generation in the first half. Our third quarter guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately 14% ,diluted shares outstanding of slightly less than $366 million, as well as an approximately $12 million of acquisition, integration and supply chain related charges.","I'll note that our full-year outlook for $55 million of charges remains unchanged. Therefore at the midpoint, our third quarter adjusted net income guidance is approximately $195 million. And our guidance for adjusted and GAAP earnings per share range from $0.52 to $0.55 and $0.49 to $0.52 respectively. With respect to the fourth quarter, we will provide specific guidance when we report our third quarter results. While we reconfirmed our guidance for the full year, given our strong first-half result and our positive outlook for the second half, we currently anticipate full-year sales to be at the midpoint of our range or higher and operating profit to be at the midpoint of our range.","So in closing, our strategies are generating revenue and cash flow growth. We delivered strong first-half results. And we feel good about our second-half outlook. And with that I'll turn the call back over to TC.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Your line is now open.","OmarSaad","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Nice job in the quarter. Couple questions, guys. Could you talk a little bit about it within the innerwear segment the basic piece, seems like it's been a little bit softer last couple quarters. And the outlook is for to kind of I think remain a little bit soft going forward. Help us understand what's going on underneath. And also could you talk about the $12 million adjustment in the cost of goods line? Was that part of the original plan for the $55 million this year and maybe address what that line item is? Thanks.","GeraldEvans","Gerald, Omar. This is Gerald. Let me take the first one. Yes, we were pleased with the quarter too, thanks for your congratulations on that. When in the case of innerwear, innerwear actually performed in total exactly where we expected. We saw sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we look at the elements of that both basics and intimates. They too performed to our expectations and in particular we're very pleased with the intimate's traction sequential improvement from quarter-to-quarter.","The innovations and the businesses and basics in particular, where you ask did very well as they did in intimates and we'll be stepping up our innovations in the second half as you said -- as you heard in our comments as well as well as we'll be breaking a new ad campaign behind our underwear business and some digital campaigns as well. So we think for the year, we're right on track with where we expected the innerwear business to be and the basics business is part of that. Certainly, we're navigating a challenging retail environment and overlapping the headwinds of bankruptcies and door closures. But we feel good about the things we're doing to put the business on track for long-term return to growth.","BarryHytinen","And Omar, this is Barry. Thanks for the question. On the charges, I would say, yes, we're right in line with our expectations. As we noted at the beginning of the year we anticipate about $55 million of charges for supply chain largely for our Western Hemisphere tightening the network. And that is proceeding through the first half right in line with what our expectation was and continues to be unchanged as it relates to the outlook. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open,","Peter McGoldrick","Hi this is Peter McGoldrick on for Jim Duffy this morning. Thank you for taking my question. Could you talk about the vetting process of the Champion partner, the second Champion partner in China? What type of incremental sales opportunity does that give you in 2020 and then beyond?","BarryHytinen","Sure. Thanks for that question. Just to give you a little background on our China business with Champion. We entered the market just a year ago with a retail partner. And we have about 50 stores that we expect to grow to about a 100 with that partner by the end of the year. We found the opportunity to bring on a second retail partner to further accelerate our growth as we look toward 2020 and beyond. And this is a great partner. It's very experienced in operating stores in China. In fact, they operate across various brands about 20,000 stores. So they're very experienced at what they do. That gives us one additional partner to enter a very large economy. And we expect to further accelerate our business not only through branded stores, but they'll also give us a great opportunity to accelerate our on line growth.","So we see Champion as a one of the big growth opportunities for Champion. And China is a big growth opportunity for Champion. And we could see they are very quickly becoming our second largest market for Champion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Susan Anderson with B Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","SusanAnderson","Hi. Good morning. Nice job on the quarter. I guess I was trying to tie together maybe if you could talk about your expectations for Champion C9 growth in the back half after 50% plus growth in the first half and then just trying to tie together your high-teens guidance. I guess you're expecting it to be down and then I was curious what you're doing I guess to drive that target consumer to your website to purchase similar product to C9 after that goes away? Because it definitely seems like there's going to be a void in the marketplace, so kind of curious from the Champion athletic side what you're doing to capture that market share. Thanks.","BarryHytinen","Okay. Hi, Susan. It's Barry. Thanks for the kind words about the quarter. And I'll take the first part and then I'll hand it over to Gerald. You asked about Champion excluding C9 in activewear. Certainly in the third quarter, we continue to expect it to grow at a strong rate, let's say very high teens which would equate to about $40 million of growth in the third quarter alone. And we have a double-digit rate growth in the fourth quarter implied as well, which represent about $215 million of growth within the US activewear segment for the full year.","I guess I should know that the way we've done the guidance is very-- the same way we did last quarter, which is we've simply rolled forward into the full year our beat if you will from the second quarter. And maintained our second half as we previously had it. We made no changes to our back half projections. So I'll acknowledge that may continue to prove conservative as it has been the first half. Gerald?","GeraldEvans","Yes. Let me just follow up on the second part of your question, Susan. From the standpoint of Champion and driving growth going forward. We're very focused on that. We love the energy the brands got. We obviously exceed our expectations in a quarter for the second quarter in a row. And we see a lot of growth avenues ahead. We think we're in the very early stages of driving growth with this brand. We see more in our current geographies and even in our current accounts. We do see the opportunity to further expand areas like women's business to further penetrate the Activewear's or the performance wear side of things to your question.","And a lot of that we are also driving with our brand investment. We're stepping up our brand investment. Our global reach has gone dramatically with our media. And we like what we're seeing as far as how that's affecting the brand and as you've heard in our comments about an additional retail partner in China, as well as we think there's additional opportunities in Europe and countries like Australia. We think there's a lot of geography left to develop. So we love the momentum in the brand. We're already approaching a $1.8 billion by the end of the year. So well ahead of pace on our $2 billion goal. And internally we're now working on our plans to take -- go to that next billion. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","LaurentVasilescu","Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. Barry last quarter you were very helpful by parsing out the International Champion that it grew high 60% of range or by $115 million on a constant current basis for the quarter. Can you parse out those numbers from the second quarter? What you're expecting to the third and full year? And then separately, any color around growth margin for the third quarter?","BarryHytinen","Okay. Good morning, Laurent. Thanks for the questions. Happy to help you with that. In the second quarter, our Champion business really continues to outperform around the globe. I'll give you the full number since you were asking about international to give you everything. The total global Champion was about $415 million in the quarter on a constant currency base. Now that was up over 50% or nearly a $145 million worth of growth. Specifically to your question, International Champion was up in the mid 40s on a percentage basis to about a $190 million. That was up about $60 million on a constant currency basis. And just to save someone else a question domestic Champion therefore was about $225 million in total, reflecting over 60% growth.","And in the US Activewear we are just over $200 million of sales. That's up over 50% or up about $70 million in dollar growth. And then therefore in the US outside of the activewear segment, we had about $25 million of Champion. For example, Basics in underwear and socks that's growing quite fast, reflecting the better than expected performance in the second quarter. And our prior outlook for the second half as I mentioned to Susan that's unchanged from the guidance we gave you really at the beginning of the year. We now expect global Champion sales excluding C9 to be in excess of $1.8 billion in constant currency. And that would equate to a low to mid-30s percentage growth rate up from our growth rate we gave you in May and certainly up considerably from the growth rate at the start of the year that we projected which was in the 20s.","So we're feeling quite good about how the team is performing with the brand. It is continuing to grow in our existing accounts through new distribution. Comps are very good. We see incremental opportunity as we go forward as Gerald mentioned just a moment ago in one of his answers. On the gross margin, as it relates to the full year, we continue expected to be up year-on-year driven by more price and mix principally in the fourth quarter, offsetting at that point lower commodity costs. In the third quarter, we expect gross margin to be relatively consistent year-on-year which is a conservative outlook for the sales and mix that we talked about and price benefit being offset by FX headwinds in light of where the dollar has trended as we saw in the second quarter, FX was more of a headwind and cost us 20 basis points of margin.","I expect that will be the similar situation in the third. And we'll have commodity costs still elevated. As you probably know, we're now getting to the point where we're going over peak commodity costs. And as we move into the fourth quarter, price will far excess be in excess of commodity cost. So that's one of the reasons why you should anticipate gross margin performance getting better in the fourth. And I appreciate the questions Laurent.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","JaredOrr","Hi. This Jared Orr on for John Kernan. Thank you very much for taking my call. I was wondering if you give any more color around the margin differential within the US Activewear segment between the three buckets if I break it out between Champion, C9 and the other. It seems like the Champion is a lot higher than you getting out of the other US Activewear segment can be a big benefit going forward.","BarryHytinen","Hi, Jared. It's Barry. Thank you for that question. I'm happy to help you some. So if you go back even a year ago, we mentioned that Champion and C9 were similar but the Champion was continuing to expand both on a gross and operating margin basis. And we anticipated C9 in light of volume would likely come in some. And frankly, the Champion margin is doing very well. It has been continued expand all of last year. This year we see continued opportunity for that to expand. And that's driven off of better mix, a broadening assortment, better price, volume leverage. On an operating margin basis, obviously, we're investing considerably and you heard that and to continue to fuel the growth of the brand around the world. And we'll continue to do that, but even there we see the operating margins despite that continue to grow.","Our activewear gross margins are up appreciably. Without giving you specific numbers well over 300 basis points in the quarter on a gross basis. And you can calculate the operating margin that you see there in light of our incremental brand support, it's up less as we anticipated, but as we said on the prepared remarks second quarter operating margin for activewear was quite strong well ahead of our expectation for a decline, it increased over a 100 bps. And you mentioned for some color on the rest of activewear, you're exactly right Jared that the exited programs, and we've been forecasting this since the beginning of the year in light of the fact that we exited those programs at the beginning of the year. They're in the comp last year.","I can point you to the FAQ document because this morning we gave you more color on those programs to give you the sales comp from prior year. And you'll see that there's a much more significant amount of sales comp in the back half as compared to the front half of the year this year. And what that results in is because those were commodity programs; we really didn't make any money on them. And so as we remix the business for those -- taking those sales out and putting in sales that are at or better than the average gross margin. And as Champion continues to inflect, we see activewear margins being significantly higher as we move through the year.","So we feel really good and that's including the incremental brand support we're adding in the third quarter. So feel very good about where we're trending with activewear.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","JaySole","Great. Thanks so much. Few questions. Barry on inventory, inventory is up about 6% at the end of the quarter. Looks a little bit higher than what you're guiding to the sales for the third quarter. Is there maybe a little bit more inventory? How might that impact gross margin in third quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like the interest expense guidance is unchanged, but at the same time these cost currency spots are a benefit. So just trying to square that circle a little bit. And then lastly, on the brand support, what's the timing of when that starts to benefit the top-line? Is it something that happens kind of immediately after you make that brand support? Or is it something you would expect to be more beneficial cumulatively into fiscal 2020 and beyond? And then if I can squeeze one last one in. SG&A dollar growth expectation for the third quarter, if get help us about that, that'd be great too. Thank you.","BarryHytinen","Okay. Jay, I'll take the first three of your one part question. And will let Gerald take one of them. So on inventory, it is a little bit higher year-on-year. I'll note that as compared to last year it reflects the fact that we are -- we invested in the first quarter as we talked about to support the Champion growth. And there's a little bit of timing there for some of our fall sets in terms of getting them in. So you'll recall on the first quarter, I mentioned that we were having trouble keeping up with demand. And we were having to expedite. So we deliberately increased our levels of inventory and brought some things in a little bit earlier to make sure that we were in a good position for the fall.","We want to be servicing our customers, as well as we possibly can. As it relates to gross margin, implications for the third quarter, I don't see any. In fact, the mix continues to be good. So we feel good about the inventory. You asked about the swap and its impact on our full-year interest expense. Look, we didn't change our full-year numbers at all as it relates to our guidance. Certainly, the swap helps us. I did put that into the third quarter. And we also reflected in the third quarter, in fact that rates are touch lower, based on yesterday continue to come lower on our variable debt. ","So for the full year, we're probably going to have some incremental benefit on the swap. We swap \u20ac300 million. We saved well over 200 bps fixed-for-fixed I might add. So over the next five years, we'll save about $8 million a year annualized. So in the back half we'll getting quite $4 million of benefit. I put that in the third and we'll -- all things equal have that benefit in the fourth. As it relates to maybe Gerald will like to take the brand support.","GeraldEvans","Sure. From the standpoint of brand support, obviously, we've seen the effect of the brand support we've increased so far. We see in the traction in the business, Jay. And we saw the opportunity to take an increase again and it's really going to be in several places. You'll see it, it's going to go against our Champion business and we could continue to invest in that growing business. As well as we've got investment behind our innerwear innovations and in the back-to-school periods particular. And as you know, back-to-school tends to play out a little later in the quarter than it traditionally has. ","So that sort of August- September period is when you see some traction begin there behind our basics and intimates innovations, where we've stepped up investment behind both. And then finally, in our International markets, particularly in a market like Australia where we've seen good traction in our businesses and where we're investing there. That's a business that has a nice retail component and you would tend to see that trend a little stronger in the fourth quarter from the impact in a business like that. So mix across the quarter and of course when you do it, you're building brand equity you tend to see that even longer term as you carried it into the next year.","So we're excited about the investment and feel we're getting good movement in our business as a result of that investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","MichaelBinetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for all the help with the detail here today. I wanted to ask you I guess on the price increases relative to the commodity prices. Can you tell us a little bit from historically what you've seen as far as the response from private label on the innerwear side, when commodity prices roll lower? Obviously, if we go channel to channel for you, we see different levels of some of the retailers stepping up their efforts in private label. I'm just --I'm wondering what you baked in as far as how you thought about the margin towards the end of the year, if there is a response from private label? And maybe they take an opportunity to be little sharp around prices as the commodity pressure rolls off?","BarryHytinen","As a manufacturer, Michael, we tend to see the cost long out as we're looking at our production. And so what we saw was general labor inflation coming around the world in our manufacturing locations where apparel is made, as well as we saw some push on commodity. And as you know, late last year we were talking about pricing going in place. We put our prices in place in mid-February and have seen them stick very nicely in the market. Now no one in the industry is immune necessarily from labor cost increases and commodity costs. And we price to maintain our margins over time since we've made our pricing and we've seen others in the market move both private label and competitors across multiple categories take price up as well.","So we have to assume that they too have felt the impact of some of those increase cost. So we feel good about our pricing and where it is. And the relationship of our price points to others in the market we feel good about.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of kind of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is now open.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Hi, this is Kelly on for Paul. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about Champion in the US. Thanks for the detail there. Could you help us understand how much of the growth in the second quarter was driven by new distribution versus growth within existing doors? And then when you think about the third quarter, it seems like there's a big step down in growth relative to the second quarter in the US. Is that just the function of more growth of an existing doors? Is there still new distribution opportunities? Any help with that would be a great. Thanks.","BarryHytinen","Hey, Kelly, this is Barry. Thanks for the questions. I'll take most of that. In the quarter, look, the vast majority of the growth is continuing income from existing accounts. And that's comps and as well as base expansion year-over-year in those existing accounts, we certainly did as we talked about last quarter have some new distribution over the last 12-months and it continues to be the case. We are being very mindful about segmenting the product and being careful about levels of distribution and broadening. But we have continued to broaden the distribution. And our consumer directed business is doing great.","So I think as broad-based growth, and I could make those similar comments about the international too I might add, you were asking about US, it's principally existing accounts driving the growth. And that's increased consumer takeaway which we're really pleased about. I think that shows the development of the brand and then as it relates to the third versus the second quarter comp. And I'll just echo my earlier points. At the beginning of the year, we gave investors a view as it relates to how we thought the year was going to play out. We mentioned that we were embedding a tapering of growth rates as we move through the year. ","And that has proven to be conservative in the first two quarters. We have not changed our back half assumptions at all, as it relates to from what we gave in February for those sales growth rates. So it could continue to prove conservative. If you look at the global Champion comps on a constant currency basis, second to third quarter, year-on-year they're very similar. And so we feel good about where we're trending.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. To follow up on an earlier one, I was a bit surprised by the third quarter innerwear guidance considering you're relatively easy compared. So would you be able to break down the factors behind the ongoing 2% declines despite the contributions from the innovation that you cited? And especially if we were to strip out the benefit from the new stock program at Dollar General? Thanks.","BarryHytinen","Okay. Hey, Tiffany, I'll take the first part of that. Thanks for the question. I'll hand it to Gerald to talk about some of the innovation. I think I'll just reiterate that the way we plan innerwear this year, now the start of the year we suggested the full year be down about 2% that included a 4% assumption in the first quarter, we did better in the first quarter. And we indicated that we were kind of taking the year and using roughly about 2% a quarter after the first quarter, and that was due to some of the timing of some of the sets as well as pricing.","And so the year is playing out for innerwear right in line with what we expected. I guess I should tell you that on a year-over-year basis, we called out that bankruptcies would continue to be a challenge for us. And I want to avoid commenting on any individual customers, but to help you a little bit in our US business year-over-year, our sales comp was impacted by three noteworthy bankruptcies in the second quarter-- so versus the prior year period that have gone bankrupt since then. And that totaled a year-on-year decline of $16 million of sales, with the vast majority of that in innerwear.","So that's a factor that we had embedded in our original guidance and our maintained guidance. And Gerald, do you want to --?","GeraldEvans","I think from the standpoint of our innovations and new space, they're all track very well. Much of the innovation is coming in the third quarter and will develop over the fourth quarter. And we step up our media for that back to school period; we're seeing great traction in the early media we put behind intimates. For example, in Maidenform and we're stepping that up behind our Bali brand. So we think you'll see that over time, but I would just echo what Barry said. We're navigating a very challenging retail environment. And we said that all year from the standpoint of the bankruptcies and door closures. ","And we're going to continue to view that retail environment with caution until we overlap those challenges. So we're very pleased with where we are. We know we're heading toward our guidance very solidly. And we feel good about how innerwear is performing for the long-term to return to growth.","BarryHytinen","Yes. And just operator before we move on to the next question, I want to make sure that everyone understood the point I was making there at the end to Kelly's question about comps second and third quarter. If you look at our global Champion growth rate on a constant currency basis in the second quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2018, they were very consistent. So we feel good about where we've guided in that framework that we outlined at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sarah Clark ","Hi. Good morning this is Sarah Clark on for Carla Casella. Thank you for taking a question. I have two quick ones for you. First can you discuss a little bit more your outlook for sourcing costs and trends in transportation and logistics cost? And along with that any details you can share on how much of your production comes from Central America or the Caribbean, Far East or other region. And then my second question this may play into the inventory that we were discussing earlier. But have you changed any of your terms with department stores or other retailers going into the holiday season? And are you seeing retailers change their ordering timing or patterns and back-to-school or holiday?","GeraldEvans","Okay. Let me take some of those. From the standpoint of the cost and logistics, we saw all that in our-- as we built our plans for the year we feel that we've adequately captured that. And as well as the rising labor cost offshore in our assembly points. And if price to maintain our margins as we work through the year. So we feel like our pricing in places has covered that very well as we look forward. From the standpoint of our manufacturing network, when we built our network a number of years ago, we took a very long view on our network and we're very thoughtful about spanning it over multiple geographies in order to offset or any potential geopolitical risk or unknowns as far as a fluctuation within different country.","So we're well spread across Asia and Central America and within Central America, we're well spread across countries like El Salvador and Honduras. While in Asia we're well spread across Vietnam for example, but we also were well spread in Thailand. So we feel like we've done a nice job of balancing our supply chain over time. We're very happy with how that's performing. From the last question was --order timing-- from an order timing standpoint, what I would say about the third quarter in particular is that back-to-school is increasingly shifted to as an event to be later in the third quarter.","So we would generally expect it to be back loaded from a sell-through standpoint and a little more back loaded from a shipment standpoint. We think we've got a great offering out there for back-to-school. And we're looking forward to seeing how it plays out over the next few months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","MichaelBinetti","Hey, guys, I jump back in the queue there. I appreciate you taking me back. I wanted to just ask, Barry, I was thinking back about the Analyst Day guidance from 2022. And at that time you guys are planning to get to a and 15.5% operating margin by 2022 and that implied about 30 basis points per year on average. I think this year's guided to about 14% so you need to be up about 50 basis points on average, so a little faster. Obviously, a few changes in the business in the world since then, but does the portfolio today have the drivers to support that 50 basis points a year or should we, to get to the original 15.5% target or should we think more about the annual improvement that you were talking about at that time of delivering 30 basis points per year with this portfolio. Is that the more appropriate way to think about the longer-term model?","BarryHytinen","Hey, Mike. Hey, Mike. It's Barry. Thanks for the question and a couple of thoughts. This year we are clearly investing more in brand support that's like $32 million more year-on-year which I wouldn't say that we won't do that again in the future, but from a standpoint of even as we look out to this year and as we get to the fourth quarter really normalizes on a year-over-year base. You'll recall last year, we were investing more in brand support in the fourth quarter. So I think we're getting to a point where it's unless we see reason for it to further accelerate our business then you're probably going to get to start seeing some significant leverage there.","Secondly this year as we talked about last year into this year commodities have continued to be a more significant headwind. And as I mentioned in an earlier question, we're just now getting here in the second and third quarter to comping over the peak levels of that. And as we get into the fourth quarter, our pricing well more than offsets those input costs. And as a result and as you look at things like some of the input costs that go into our COGS, they've been coming in.","And I would anticipate that all of things equal commodities versus pricing ought to be very favorable as we move forward. Obviously, those things can change, but we feel extremely good about our pricing. And then the other thing I'll call out is, look, the Champion margin has got more room and continues to expand in excess of what we would have been anticipating at that point, recognizing of course from an operating margin standpoint we've been putting in those investments that I mentioned would be able to lever going forward. ","So and then the international margins continue to expand, and that's driven off volume, scale, leverage and acquisition synergies. Our latest acquisition just to talk about bras and things is doing very well and very accretive to margin. So I view it as an opportunity to continue to expand the margins going forward. I think the underlying trends in the business are quite good. And over the next several years we feel good about where we're trending.","End of Q&A","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to T.C. Robillard for closing remarks.","T.C. Robillard","We'd like to thank everyone for attending our call today. And we look forward to speaking with you soon.

For today' call, Gerald and Barry will provide some brief remarks. And then, we'll open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Thank you, T.C. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, including strong organic revenue growth, significant cash flow generation, and reduced leverage. Our three growth initiatives: champion, consumer-direct, and international delivered stronger than expected results in the quarter.","And our U.S innerwear business saw meaningful improvement from the third quarter with revenue and profit results that were in line with our guidance. This growing momentum across our business delivered our best fourth quarter performance in four years. And as we look into 2019, we are well positioned to accelerate our operating cash flow growth, as well as bring our leverage back within our long-term range.","At our Investor Day, we spoke about how we\u2019ve diversified our business and increased our global scale to provide a path to significantly grow our cash flow and generate higher shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strong fourth quarter results and our 2019 operating cash flow outlook underscore the progress we are making toward achieving the goals we laid out in May.","For the quarter, revenue growth of more than 7% exceeded our expectation s. Organic constant currency growth of over 6% marked our 6th consecutive quarter of growth as well as our highest organic growth quarter in eight years. And for 2018, the 2% organic constant currency growth was our first full-year increase since 2014.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 10%, and margins expanded 40 basis points over prior year. We generated $0.5 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter. The highest of any quarter in our company's history. And we reduced our leverage on a net debt to EBITDA basis by 0.5x to 3.3x.","Touching on our growth initiatives: Champion revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Excluding the mass channel, Global Champion revenue was up more than 50% in constant currency. This growth comes on top of last year's 29%, and once again highlights that our coordinated global strategy to elevate the Champion brand is driving increased demand for the product.","Consumer-direct revenue, which we define as our own stores and all online channels, increased more than 20% globally compared to the prior year and represented approximately 25% of global sales in the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, our International segment delivered another quarter of high single-digit organic revenue growth, driven by Champion and our Innerwear businesses in Australia, Asia, and the Americas.","With respect to our U.S Innerwear business, we are pleased that fourth quarter sales and operating margin were in line with our outlook. For the quarter, basics revenue increased 2% over last year and our Intimates business while down improved sequentially.","That said, the U.S retail landscape remains challenging. We\u2019re encouraged by a number of positive signs underlying both our basics in Intimates business, but the prolonged bankruptcies and door closings are impeding our return to consistent growth in the segment.","Despite our improving fourth quarter trends, we decided to take a more conservative view of our U.S Innerwear segment for 2019 than we held in November, given the ongoing uncertainty in the U.S midtier and department store channel. Our outlook now reflects a more cautious stance with respect to door closings in these channels.","However, as a strong diversified global company we\u2019re more than offsetting this with our growth businesses. For 2019, we're forecasting approximately 2.5% organic constant currency growth at the midpoint as the momentum in our U.S Activewear and International segments continues to fuel our overall revenue growth.","We expect operating margin expansion of approximately 10 basis points at the midpoint, as we leverage our global scale and implement price increases to offset input cost inflation. We're forecasting operating cash flow with $750 million at the midpoint of our range, an increase of approximately 17% or $100 million from last year. And we're committed to bring our leverage below 3x by the end of the year.","We fully understand investors focus on our U.S Innerwear business and we remain committed to returning this business to long-term growth. In 2019, we're increasing our marketing investment behind our key brands and innovations. We're also taking additional steps to further streamline our U.S Intimate supply-chain, which should lower costs and increase our speed to market.","However, we don't want to lose sight of the fact that we have transformed to become a diverse, global apparel company, operating a portfolio of profitable businesses with many avenues for growth. And these efforts are delivering their intended results. We're producing consistent organic revenue growth six quarters in a row and counting. And this is being driven by the areas we have diversified into, such as Champion, consumer-direct and International.","We are leveraging our global scale and brand strength to improve our operating margins. Our leverage is coming down and we're poised to accelerate cash flow generation as our acquisition integrations come to a close. With all those momentum, we feel well positioned to deliver accelerated value creation to our shareholders over the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry A. Hytinen","Thanks, Gerald. Overall, we delivered solid fourth quarter results as we achieved or exceeded our expectations across all of our key metrics, including sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow.","For the quarter, sales were $1.77 billion, an increase of $123 million over last year. Adjusted operating profit increased 10% to $260 million, while adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.7%.Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.48 and $0.44, respectively. We generated over $500 million in cash flow from operations and we pay down $400 million of debt, lowering our leverage to 3.3x.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 7.5% over last year, which included $45 million from acquisition contributions and a $26 million headwind from foreign exchange. On an organic constant currency basis, sales increased 6.3% in the quarter.","Gross margin of 40.1% was consistent with prior year as the impacted input cost inflation, product mix and foreign exchange offset the benefits from acquisition contributions, synergies and price increases for certain Activewear products. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points compared to last year driven by acquisition contributions and expense management, partially offset by investments to support growth.","For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges of $15 million were in line with our guidance as was our tax rate of 14.9%. Normalizing the prior year for the impact of tax reform, adjusted and GAAP earnings per share increased 12% and 175%, respectively.","Now let me take you through our segment performance. U.S Innerwear sales were flat to last year in line with our guidance. Basics revenue increased 2%, driven by growth in men's and women's underwear, while Intimate sales declined 7% which was an improvement from last quarter.","Within Intimate, strong consumer reception to our new product designs and innovation drove double-digit revenue growth in Shapewear for the quarter. This was offset by lower bra sales, which continue to be impacted by door closings and the challenge in the retail landscape within the midtier and department store channel.","For the quarter, U.S Innerwear's operating margin was consistent year-over-year. U.S Activewear segment sales increased 13.5% in the quarter and 13% organically. This growth was driven by strong performance in our Champion and American Casualwear businesses.","Domestic Champion sales, excluding the mass channel increased over 50% in the quarter. And as expected, Champion at mass, which is our C9 business declined less than 3%. Activewear's operating margin declined 150 basis points in the quarter to 16.1%, due to product mix as well as our planned investments to support future growth initiatives, inclusive of brand support and distribution network expansion.","In our International segment, sales increased 12% or $64 million, which included a $43 million contribution from Bras N Things and a $26 million headwind from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On an organic constant currency basis, sales increased 8.5% or $47 million compared to last year.","International's operating margin increased 200 basis points over last year to 16.2%. An important take away from me, International's operating margin was above the corporate average for the second straight quarter reflecting the improved profitability from scale and synergies that we had forecasted earlier in the year.","Before I move on, let me touch on our Global Champion business. For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 33% over last year, while revenue excluding C9 increased over 50%. For the full-year, constant currency revenue, excluding C9 was $1.36 billion, up from approximately $1 billion in 2017 and we split equally between Domestic and International.","Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. In the quarter, we generated $502 million of cash flow from operations. Inventory was up year-on-year, primarily due to increased investments to support the global demand for our Champion products.","Our focus on both receivables and payables resulted in an eight day improvement in our cash cycle versus prior year. With respect to leverage, we pay down over $400 million of debt in the quarter, lowering our leverage to 3.3x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down from last year and down significantly from our peak of 3.9x in early 2018 after the acquisition of Bras N Things.","And now turning to guidance. To assist you with your models, we have provided a number of details on first quarter and full-year 2019 guidance in our FAQ document. Therefore, I will focus my guidance comments on certain assumptions that should help describe the cadence of the year.","For the full-year at the midpoint, we expect total sales growth of approximately 2% and organic constant currency growth of approximately 2.5%. Our outlook reflects approximately $60 million of currency headwind with the vast majority of that impacting the first quarter.","For the first quarter, at the midpoint, we expect total sales growth of more than 4% and organic constant currency growth of approximately 6%. With respect to our segments, the midpoint of our revenue guidance assumes a 2% decline in our U.S Innerwear segment for the full-year and a 4% decline in the first quarter.","This outlook reflects the impact from door closings, as Gerald mentioned, and an improving trend in the remaining quarters due to the mid first-quarter timing of our price increases and our conservative view on elasticity.","In U.S Activewear, the midpoint of our full-year outlook reflects approximately 2.5% revenue growth. This assumes Champion, excluding C9 grows at a double-digit rate in each quarter and that our C9 business declined at a low teens rate for the full-year. It also assumes a decline in our American Casualwear business as we continue to shift this business to higher-margin products.","The vast majority of the full-year decline in both C9 and American Casualwear is expected in the second half of the year. The mix impact of these assumptions should yield significant margin improvement in our Activewear segment for the year with margin expansion in each quarter.","For the first quarter, we expect Activewear segment sales to increase approximately 10%. In our International segment, the midpoint of our full-year guidance assumes reported sales growth of approximately 6%. On an organic constant currency basis, our guidance reflects approximately 8% growth, driven by our International, Champion businesses as well as our Innerwear business in Asia, Australia and the Americas. Partially offsetting this are the macro headwinds impacting our European Innerwear business.","For the first quarter, we expect reported revenue growth of approximately 8%, which includes the nonorganic contributions from Bras N Things and approximately $40 million of currency headwind. At the midpoint, our full-year guidance implies approximately 50 basis points of gross margin expansion and 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.","We expect interest and other expenses of approximately $224 million and a tax rate of approximately 14%. Therefore, our full-year adjusted net income guidance at the midpoint of our range is approximately $643 million. Our guidance assumes diluted shares outstanding of approximately 366 million.","Our 2019 outlook assumes approximately $55 million of charges, of which $35 million are cash. These charges reflect the completion of all remaining acquisition integrations as well as our supply chain actions, including the reduction of associated overhead costs, principally within our Western Hemisphere network. This is $20 million higher than previously estimated, as we've expanded our plan to improve our cost position and drive improved profitability. In isolation, we would expect these actions to deliver approximately $50 million of incremental profit with approximately $40 million of that coming in 2020.","Lastly, with respect to cash flow, we expect to generate between $700 million and $800 million of cash flow from operations in 2019. And consistent with our normal seasonality, we expect cash flow from operations to be used in the first half. For 2019, our capital allocation priority remains focused on using all excess free cash flow to pay down debt. Therefore, we currently project our leverage on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis to be approximately 2.9x at the end of the year.","So in closing, we delivered a strong fourth quarter. Our diversification efforts are delivering consistent organic growth. We are taking additional actions to improve profitability and we're well-positioned to further accelerate our cash flow growth in 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and we will continue as time allows. I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson","Hi. Good morning. Nice job in the quarter. I guess, I wanted to maybe drilldown a little bit more on the Champion growth. It's nice to see that continued a growth strongly. Maybe if you could talk about the growth across regions, and then also just the growth profile as we look out through 2019 where you think the opportunities are within shelf space, new doors and new products. And then, also if there's any thoughts for the C9 brand after it exits the mass business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Hi, Susan. This is Gerald. Yes, thank you. We are very proud of the fourth quarter. We thought it really showed strongly the efforts we put in place to diversify our business and create many paths to profitable growth. And one of those is certainly the Champion brand as we look at the story, it's a great story. The reuniting and elevating of that that brand globally has had tremendous success for us. As we noted in our comments, it grew at above 30% rate in 2018, and we are expecting that again in 2019 leaving us well ahead of our goal -- with the pace to reach our goal of $2 billion by 2022. The acceleration is really -- and the strength is really around the world. We saw a strong double-digit growth around the world we noted in the fourth quarter. For example, that we -- excluding C9, it was up 50% on a global basis, the Champion brand. And we see it coming through expansion within our wholesale partners. We also see it through our own stores around the world and partner stores and we're seeing it come online. In fact, some of the new geographies we're bringing on is we're seeing growth in China now as we\u2019ve entered that market. We\u2019re seeing nice expansion of our presence in China as well as the Korean market has begin to -- beginning to develop for us. So we see a lot of runway to continue to build the business as we look forward just to -- I just had a personal opportunity to review the fall line. It looks great and we see lots of opportunity to continue to incorporate more and more style into the brand. This is an important year for us. This is the hundredth anniversary of Champion. And we\u2019ve just launched our first global campaign behind the brand with a particular focus on that young consumer that\u2019s really adopting the brand at 18 to 24-year-old group is going to carry this brand on to the next generation for us. From a standpoint of C9, we -- that brand continues to perform very well at retail from a point-of-sale. We certainly continue to look at options for that. As you can tell from my comments, our first priority is to continue to optimize the performance of the growing Champion business, but we continue to look at options for that as well. And if one were to emerge that would just be upside to the strong momentum we have in the brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Really nice quarter. Great to see the cash flow production and debt reduction as well, guys. But I do want to ask a follow-up on Champion. Really feels like the brands at a point where it could really benefit from a significantly more aggressive marketing spend, talent acquisition, it feels like -- especially when you\u2019re talking about this basics, Champion basics business you are doing, you\u2019re thinking more about segmenting the Champion brand across channels? Maybe you could talk about that. The website too is another area where there is probably a lot of room for investment and opportunity, given what you got going on the brand. Maybe you could talk about how you\u2019re prioritizing investments. How much the investment that was increasing around Champion and how you\u2019re thinking about segmenting the brand to keep it -- the demand forward as strong as possible? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Sure, Omar. Yes, we -- you are definitely on the right track. We are stepping up the investment as I noted in my prior comment. One of the first things we\u2019ve done is, is launch our first global campaign. As you know, we've used digital very effectively to connect with the younger consumer, we're stepping up our efforts that way as well as driving this global campaign. Our online presence does have opportunity for further development and its one of our key focuses is to develop our own website as well as working with others on their sites as well. And a key part of developing the business is the segmentation of the line and that was a lot of what I saw in the fault [ph] line that I referenced in the prior note. And one of the great things about having our global brands, our global connection of the brand is we\u2019re able to lift and land products from around the world. So we are carefully segmenting the business by channel and even within customers, within channels to keep that that strong presence for the brand and keep the differentiation for our core customers. The basics reference was really around the basics socks and underwear business, its developing very nicely behind the brand and the strength of the brand and we are selectively placing that within our customers as well. And that\u2019s differentiated as well by individual customer and channel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to hone in on the U.S Activewear guide for 2019. If we take the guidance of 2.5% growth for 2019 and excel the C9 business by about $15 million this year. That would imply that the non-C9 Activewear business will be up about 7%. Is that the right way to think about? And then, can you tell us how big the American Casual business was in 2018 and where does it go for 2019? Thank you.","Barry A. Hytinen","Hi, Laurent. This is Barry. Good question. Let me dive a little deep into Activewear, US Activewear to help everyone. Within U.S Activewear, for the first quarter and really for the first half of planning U.S Activewear to be up slightly over 10%. Now for the year as you noted, we're planning the segment to be up 2.5%. We're basically currently projecting the third quarter to be flat and the fourth quarter to be down mid to high singles, let's say 7%. Now if we dive deeper, let me start maybe by framing U.S Activewear based on some of the questions you just had. In 2018, that was about $1.79 billion for the segment. Now that\u2019s made up of C9 in Activewear of $382 million in 2018. As the Champion, recall Global Champion was $1.36 billion, of which about half of that was in the U.S. So that $680 million in total U.S Champion, but $30 million of that is in Innerwear for the basics that Omar was asking about. So there's about $650 million of Champion in U.S Activewear. The balance of that, of the U.S Activewear segment, $760 million in '18 includes our American Casualwear business, our bookstore, our sports apparel, alternative apparel, there's a lot of businesses in there. So turning to 2019, you were correct. For C9, we're planning it down and really much of that is in the back half. We are planning the first half to be down in line with the decline we saw in the fourth quarter, so it's down about 4%, 5%. As Gerald noted, we got good visibility on first half bookings already. As the program winds down, we're planning for the third quarter to be down, say, 15% in the fourth quarter, down about 30%, that\u2019s about $15 million and $30 million, respectively, or $45 million for the back half. Now that brings C9 to be a decline of just over $50 million or 14% for the full-year. We've got U.S Champion up on a percentage basis in the high 20s, which is about $180 million of growth for the U.S Activewear segment. Now we\u2019ve that plan in the first quarter, up more than the full-year, following the trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and additionally the bookings we already have from customers. We assume the year-on-year growth kind of naturally tapers as we start to lap higher comps through the year, though with double-digit growth across all the quarters. And frankly that that trajectory is just us being prudent and frankly I think this is probably an area where we could prove to be conservative because Champion is doing incredibly well, and we continue to fuel its growth, but will update you all as we move through the year. And that brings you to that balance of U.S Activewear, which year-on-year is impacted by the transition of the higher margin products that we mentioned out of the American Casualwear business as we transition there and we anticipate the balance of the business to be down, say, 11% or 12%, which is about $80 million with the more of that in the back half. So that was a lot, but I appreciate the question. I wanted to help you on packet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","James Duffy","Thank you. Good morning. Nice work on the cash flow, guys. Barry, can you help us by speaking to the building blocks of the '19 cash flow from operation guidance, including the working capital components that bridge the gap between the GAAP net income guide of 596 at the midpoint and cash flow from ops guide at 750 at the midpoint?","Barry A. Hytinen","Sure. Thanks, Jim, and appreciate the kind words about '18. It is a big team effort and we're very pleased with the performance. And I think it speaks to what we've got going forward in the cash flow in this business inherently. So moving to '19, yes, I will start exactly where you did with GAAP net income of $596 million at the midpoint. If you add back our non-cash items for such things as D&A and stock comp, that\u2019s probably in the order of the same area it was this year for those items, which is about $180 million -- $170 million, $180 million. Note that in the supply chain actions and charges we mentioned of the total $55 million, I called up that about $20 million of that is non-cash, so you would add that back. Just those two alone with our GAAP net income puts you very close to the high-end of our cash flow guidance for the full-year. And so if you think about our midpoint, frankly I\u2019m just kind be in a little bit conservative on working capital. When I say conservative because frankly the team has got a lot of actions around continuing to reduce inventory as we move through the year. And as you noted or as we've noted before, I should say, we grew inventory to support Champion and I think as we move through the year we will be able to sell that down. So I feel very good about the cash flow guidance and frankly moving forward into 2020 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Eddie Ryan","Hi. This is Eddie Ryan on for Jay. So, can you help us unpack that 50 basis point gross margin expansion guide for the full-year? And how much of that is mix versus pricing versus product cost?","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","So I would tell you that there's a nice piece from pricing in our Innerwear business. When you think about the pricing opportunity we noted last year that we had about, call it, $40 million of input costs inflation, we will price for that here in the mid quarter of first quarter, we\u2019ve taken a conservative view on elasticity. And so I would say that pricing is driving about, call it, $40 million or so of benefit. In the year, you'll lap and get more of that in the first quarter of 2020. There's a very nice mix coming out of both Champion on a global basis together with the remixing, that transition we mentioned out of some of the lower margin products in Activewear. And those are the primary items, I call out and then as it relates to one -- couple of drags, when you think about our Innerwear guidance and it's kind of our prudent nature for where we're guiding U.S Innerwear, that\u2019s a higher-margin segment. So as it has organic, if you will, non-price based decline, that will drag on margin, that will impact the first quarter since we don\u2019t have the pricing benefit until the second. So those would be some key callouts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is now open.","Daniel Stroller","Yes. This is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. With regard to Champion growth this year, is there any way to parse it out the expectation for North America growth between units and price and expanded distribution and comps? And then on the Champion source, is there any productivity and metrics you\u2019re willing to share, that would be great. Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Yes. I would say, when you look at our Champion business beyond just the U.S., it's globally we're seeing good benefit from both distribution expansion, more space within the customers we already have, as well as price. So it's really a blend of everything you mentioned. Additionally, we will have some more retail store outlets as we continue to build those out around the world. So it's a good balance.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the progress.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Thanks, John.","Barry A. Hytinen","Thank you.","John Kernan","Can you talk to the Innerwear category, in general. You had clearly made some progress in the fourth quarter. The trend of the business did show improvement. You have had some revitalization initiatives in that category. Can you just talk to the overall health of that channel in terms of inventory and how you're viewing that, the Innerwear, particularly in the mass category going forward?","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Yes. John, we are very pleased with Q4 in our U.S Innerwear business. It came in right on our guidance and was flat to last year. And you're right, we're seeing a lot of positive signs in that business were basic revenues up 2%, our space is expanding for 2019 in basics. We got price increases in place. In our intimates, we're seeing traction behind our initiatives there. So we feel we\u2019ve got our business on path to return to growth long-term. We\u2019re viewing the market with caution and we noted that in our comments certainly the Shopko bankruptcy coming early in the year on top of the late 2018 Sears bankruptcy and some general thoughts that there could be other door closures in the market or -- and or tightening of inventory caused us to really step back and view the market with little more caution as we entered the year. We adjusted our numbers accordingly. And we do acknowledge that some of these assumptions could prove to be conservative as we work through the year, but given the ongoing upheaval at retail, we felt it was best to approach the year with some caution. From the standpoint of the market, it's generally performing as we expect. And our inventories we finished in line with where we expected to be for the year and we -- you may recall, that last quarter we commented that there's been a little bit of a lag in reordering behind our POS. We saw that catch up early in the year and we felt like it -- and as we entered into the year, we were in line from an inventory standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Would you break down and quantify your International performance for us in more detail by geography to give us a better picture of the sources and offsets of growth, especially if you call that headwinds in Europe Innerwear? Additionally, how much margin expansion can we expect for the segment in 2019 as we move further past the Champion Europe and Pacific brands acquisitions? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Yes, let me take the first part of that question. I will let Barry take the last part of the question. From the standpoint of our International business, its -- it did -- it perform tremendously well in the quarter and really speaks to the strength of what we've been building there, and the diversity of what we're building. We saw strong growth with Champion across the businesses, but we also saw strong growth across our Innerwear businesses in Asia, Australia and the Americas. And we saw 200 basis points of operating margin improvement in that business in the quarter, so you're seeing the synergies come through. As we noted in our comments, there was some softness in our European -- in Europe that we experienced in our Innerwear business, and that were really macro pressures. We're were well-established in the German and the French economies and our French markets, and those economies did feel some slowing as we went through the back quarters of the year. We saw the apparel businesses in total slower, the category is low in total in those markets in back half of the year. Our shares held as we came through and we have leading shares in those markets. So that\u2019s important for us to know and it tells us our businesses are solid in those markets. So as we looked into 2019, we are guiding toward a high single-digit organic constant currency growth again for our International businesses, including a strong first-quarter. And it's going to be driven again by our Champion growth, but also Innerwear growth across Asia, Australia and the Americas and we have cautiously planned Europe. Should that market begin to turn from a macro standpoint and certainly we'd see some improved performance there as well.","Barry A. Hytinen","Hi, Tiffany. This is Barry. I will give you a little bit more help on sales and maybe operating profit, some thoughts to think about. In our International segment, we have reported sales growth expected around 8% in the first quarter and its about 6% for the year. Now as we've already mentioned, in the first quarter reported growth is benefited by both the organic, but also the inorganic growth from Bras N Things offset by unfavorable FX. And the remaining quarters we\u2019ve got them planned very similar in terms of growth with one call-out being that we expect FX to still be a headwind in the second quarter. From a profit standpoint, if we just start with sales, I think International operating profit is probably up $35 million, $40 million on $136 million increase in sales. Bras N Things inorganic contribution as we call that is about $3 million held, but that's more than offset by the FX headwind to say $7 million. Now that -- those note -- I would note that we will be investing to support our brands on a global basis and in total for the company I would estimate that our increase in investment to support growth is probably in the $25 million range year-on-year with the vast majority of that supporting brands and a slight expansion to our distribution network to support all the growth we're experiencing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Marotta with CL King & Associates. Your line is now open.","Steven Marotta","Good morning, Gerald, Barry, and T.C. Considering the guidance for the current fiscal year includes the basis point gross margin improvement and 10 basis point increase in operating margin. There is an inherent SG&A deleverage there. I believe you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you will be increasing marketing as well as investments for the year. Can you talk a little bit about those -- I think quantify to the best you can. Also if there's lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter standpoint, that would be extremely helpful as well.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Okay. Sure. I mean, I guess I would start with where I just finished off, the big investment that we\u2019re make -- one of the big investments we\u2019re making is the -- that to support growth, and that\u2019s $25 million globally. I would generally plan that kind of rev pro rata across the quarters, and that's one of the reasons why the first quarter is showing profit that we have there. So a figure of, say, $6 million of headwind to the first quarter profit from those investments to support growth. And we are naturally adding back the one-time bankruptcy charge we had in '18 and that\u2019s partially offset by a variable compensation going back to target levels and things of that nature. But for the most part, Steve, we feel very good about where we are and other than the first quarter call out, which we have in both the FAQ and I spoke to some extent, I would say the year is consistent in seeing margin expansion second-quarter through fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather Balsky","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, I had a question and then a follow-up. The first is, you talked about putting more marketing behind Innerwear and your basics. I was hoping you could talk about sort of what level of marketing are you putting in and your willingness to kind of spend to reinvigorate that business? And then I will get to my follow-up.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Let me just start with how -- what we\u2019re going to do and I will let Barry comment a little bit on the other pieces of it. But from a standpoint of what we\u2019re doing, we are certainly going to put support as we always do behind our basics business. We\u2019ve got some important innovations out there and we will support those with our ComfortFlex Fit underwear being, in particular, one of them. On the Intimates side, we\u2019ve been supporting our Bali [ph] business and we intend to do that, but we also intend to invest behind our Maidenform business. It's -- it has a lot of appeal among the millennial consumer and we intend to take the -- take some success from our playbook with Champion and apply to Maidenform and really begin to connect digitally with the young consumer. And we opened up maidenform.com at the end of the year. We're already seeing some nice connection and the younger consumer coming to the brand and we will reinforce that with our investment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Chethan Mallela","Hi. Good morning. So two quick questions for me. First, as we think about the 50% constant currency growth rate for Champion, excluding the C9 business in the quarter, can you just help us think about the relative growth rate between the performance in the lifestyle product? And then second, on the Innerwear pricing, I believe that it's going in effect at the beginning of February. So can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive marketplace, whether you\u2019ve seen your peers start to move or not. And it's probably too early to see real reads, but I think you referenced more cautious elasticity assumptions than before. Just a little more detail on how that\u2019s changing and why? Thank you so much.","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Sure. From the standpoint of Champion, we're seeing growth across the entire business. They\u2019re certainly developing performance business within that broader range and certainly the business had a performance heritage. So we see that we\u2019ve got breadth and development of the line across and I think many would say that after six -- well two years now, strong growth that\u2019s circling far beyond a fad. This is a real growth brand and we\u2019ve got a lot of room to continue to grow that business. From the standpoint of our price increases, they are going in place as we speak. And so they\u2019re -- are going into the market. We've seen that many consumer goods or companies are also implementing price increases and so we all know that we're dealing with input costs and many others are taking price increases. It's hard to say what the competitive market will do. We have seen some of our competitors in some of our other businesses, like Printwear, take price increases and they too are incurring input costs increases, and I\u2019m sure that they will have to deal with those as we go forward, but that's yet to be seen. Barry, anything on that?","Barry A. Hytinen","From elasticity standpoint, I think it was the final part of your question. We plan the price increases going mid-quarter and we planned cautiously. We'll see how that plays out.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather Balsky","Hi. I was supposed to have a follow-up. So here I\u2019m. The other question is with regards to your synergies and your savings from Project Booster. Can you just update us on where you\u2019re and how much you\u2019ve remaining for the, I guess, actually your \u2026?","Gerald W. Evans Jr.","Yes, Project Booster has been a great program for us. We\u2019re generating a lot of savings as we've gone through the program. The environment has changed a lot since we started that program, and we\u2019ve experienced some broader and higher input costs inflation over that period of time and had some additional door closers. But as we looked at it, there's really two areas. Booster had two main elements, a cost savings element and an investment element. And those benefits are visible in the expanding gross margin certainly from a savings standpoint. And we\u2019ve had a multiyear increase in brand support that that is showing up when we are discussing numerous questions today. So at this stage everything that -- from Booster is flowing through, but as is always in our DNA we're moving on to the next cost savings project and that\u2019s the Western Hemisphere project we spoke about in our comments and Barry referenced, where we look to further tighten our supply chain and improve the -- and eliminate some overhead costs as well. As we noted, that will be a two year savings project, that will generate about $50 million in total, about $40 million of that would be in 2020, and the balance of $10 million would be in 2021.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carla Casella with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Carla Casella","Hi. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk to the department stores and how much you built into your guidance further closures from Sears and J. C. Penney? And then what percentage of your sales are department stores today?","Barry A. Hytinen","Hey, Carla. It's Barry. We are taking, I would say, prudent approach as it relates to Sears. We have not included it in our guidance for 2019. And as Gerald mentioned in his prepared remarks, if you kind of look at our U.S Innerwear business, factor out the pricing, kind of think about the Sears point, what we really planned is kind of conservative view as it relates to midtier department store. And while we don't have any specific windows, one additional small bankruptcy earlier and that's about $10 million of sales. But beyond that, the remainder of the decline network kind of forecasting is all in the area you're describing, and I would describe it just being kind of prudent because we are seeing some nice trends in our Innerwear business as it relates to basic space and just the trajectory of we saw in the back half in that kind of movement in the fourth quarter off the third quarter trend. So we feel good about where we are. I think we're planned in that area and we will continue to update you through the year.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Hanesbrands delivered another quarter of strong results. Continued margin improvement in our base business along with contributions from our acquisitions drove a 16% increase in earnings per share, once again highlighting the power of our business model.","This marks another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and with the performance of our base business remaining synergies from our acquisitions and the benefits from deploying future cash flows we believe we have the right formula to delivered double-digit earnings growth for many years to come.","As a management team and as an organization we have a simple mission to generate superior long-term returns for our shareholders. We have been able to accomplish this in two ways, the first is by executing the right long-term business strategies, which includes investing in our manufacturing and deploying our margin enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy.","And the second is by taking a disciplined return centric approach to deploying our free cash flow. Our cash flow is a huge part of our value creation formula, which is used to pay dividends, make acquisitions, as we've said before, at some point to repurchase shares. Our dividend is in place and we expect overtime for it to grow in line with our earnings.","Over the last 24 months we have completed three acquisitions for approximately $1.3 billion. Once we achieve full synergies these are expected to annually contribute roughly $1.4 billion in sales, $230 million in operating profit and $0.48 in earnings per share.","Acquisitions will clearly remain one of our core strategies going forward, given the breath of our opportunities, our strong balance sheet and our proven integration processes.","With respect to share repurchases the common perception is this is an either\/or decisions as it relates to acquisitions. However, at our current capital structure, targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2 to 3 times, coupled with our cash generation ability, we firmly believe that we can easily do both acquisitions and repurchases simultaneously.","We have no need to accumulate significant cash on our balance sheet to do acquisitions nor do we strive to become investment grade. Therefore, our intent is to always use our excess cash to create the best long-term returns for our shareholders, by using a mixture of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.","In summary, our overall business continues to track to our plan, we delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and our visibility into the second half gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid to high teens EPS growth for the full year. As we've shown over the past two years, our business model is designed to drive strong shareholder returns and we remained dedicated to continuing this trend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thanks, Rich. Continued execution of our core strategies combined to drive another quarter of strong performance. Our acquisition strategy contributed nicely to second quarter results, as both DBApparel and Knights Apparel delivered operating profit that was slightly ahead of plan.","Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and integration strategies continued to bear fruit. Constant currency revenue growth in our base business accelerated from first quarter levels, while base operating margins expanded another 180 basis points.","Before getting into our business results, let me begin with a brief update on our two integrations. With respect to DBA, we've already begun to in-source some of their third-party manufacturing. Earlier this month, we\u2019ve produced the first team boxer briefs in our Vietnam facility.","In terms of the overall integration, we have completed all but one of their acquired work council consultations and we remained on track to begin implementing many of the integration actions in the fourth quarter. This should lead to substantial synergy benefits in 2016 and continuing into 2017 and beyond, ultimately allowing us to reach our goal of \u20ac100 million of operating profit.","Looking at Knights Apparel, we have completed our integration planning and have begun communicating to employees. We're on track to begin the integration actions by the end of this year with synergies beginning to flow through our P&L in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to double their operating profit to roughly $40 million within the next two to three years.","Turning to our segments, Innerwear sales declined 1% in the quarter, as mid single-digit growth in basics was offset by a decline in intimates. With respect to our basics business, in the quarter we saw growth across underwear, socks and panties, driven by further share gains and strong performance from our innovation platform.","X-Temp and ComfortBlend are now 15% of our basics business, which is up from 13% and with the doubling of our X-Temp space this year, we expect this year to continue to grow.","Innerwear\u2019s operating profit increased 7% over last year and as operating margin expanded 190 basis points driven by efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from Maidenform and ongoing cost controls and SG&A.","Switching to Activewear segment, sales growth accelerated from first quarter levels, driven by the acquisition of Knights Apparel, as well as growth in our Champion and Gear for Sports business.","As expected, Champion sales and sporting goods mid-tier and department store channels grew significantly in the quarter, up 42% over last year due to the concentration of new program shipments in the second quarter this year, compared to the first quarter last year.","In these channels Champion sales year-to-date are in line with our plan and we remain on track for another year of solid double-digit growth. Activewear\u2019s operating margins improved 130 basis points in the quarter, as product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight SG&A controls more than offset the expected dilution from Knights Apparel.","Turning to international, the year-over-year growth in the quarter was driven by our acquisition of DBA. Looking at our base international business, which excludes DBA and the target Canada bankruptcy sales in constant currency increase roughly 8% in the quarter.","With respect to DBA in spite of ongoing economic headwinds in Europe, the business performed well in the quarter with sales increasing in Spain and the U.K. We expanded our hosiery market share in Spain, France and Germany, as well as our underwear market share in France. These results combined with excellent cost controls and favorable supply chain performance generated profits that were above planned for the quarter.","So to sum up, overall we are right where we expected to be at this stage of the year and we feel great about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Looking beyond this year, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the next several years as our strategies are working, our brands are resonating with consumers and our integrations are progressing on schedule.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Moss","Thanks, Gerald. Our Innovate-to-Elevate, supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies combined to drive a 16% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter. In fact that we were able to deliver mid-teens earnings growth on top of last year's 43% increase is a testament to the power and sustainability of our business model.","In the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 15% over last year, as our base business increased 1%, while acquisitions contributed approximately 14 points of growth. Operating profit increased 15% over last year, driven by contributions from DBA and Knights Apparel, tight SG&A management, efficiency gains in our supply chain and synergies from Maidenform.","Now let me give you some color on the strong margin performance in the quarter. Our gross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 39.1%. Acquisitions contributed roughly 60 basis points to the increase, a structurally lower margins in Knights Apparel were more than offset by structurally higher margins in DBA. The remainder of the increase was driven predominantly by supply chain efficiencies on our base business.","SG&A costs, as a percentage of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.6%, driven by our acquisitions. The result was a 20 basis point increase in our operating profit margin, as the 180 basis point improvement in our base business more than offset the expected March percentage dilution from the addition of DBA and Knights Apparel.","Looking at the rest of our results, interest and another expense of $30 million was roughly $8 million above last year due to the higher debt levels from our acquisitions, as well as the additional costs associated with our debt refinancing. Our tax rate was 13% in the quarter and earnings per share were $0.50. Cash flow from operations was right on plan and we ended the quarter with $315 million in cash on our balance sheet.","Turning to guidance. I will highlight some of the key pieces, but I\u2019d also like to provide additional color as it relates to the individual quarters. You'll find our full guidance details in our press release and the associated commentary in our updated FAQ document.","We\u2019ve refined our full year sales guidance for approximately $5.9 billion, with roughly $15 million to $20 million of the adjustment coming from further deterioration and key exchange rates. We slightly increased our operating profit guidance to a range of $855 million to $875 million. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $100 million.","Our full year tax rate of approximately 13%, and an earnings per share range of a $1.60 to a $1.66. Looking into the second half of the year, we have a significant amount of visibility. Our space is set, our pricing and promotional programs are in place and we locked in our key input costs including cotton.","Based on our guidance, we are expecting second half operating profit to increase 10% to 14% over last year, which implies second half operating margins could increase roughly 20 to 60 basis points. However, due to certain timing shifts this year, we are expecting year-over-year operating profit growth for individual quarters to be very uneven.","We expect third quarter operating profit growth in the mid single-digits range, while we expect fourth quarter growth to be in the high-teens to low 20% range. The timing shift is due to a concentration of promotional spending in the third quarter this year, the timing around realizations of certain supply chain and integration savings, as well as the benefit from lower cotton prices in the fourth quarter.","So in closing, our overall performance this year is tracking right to our plan and this coupled with our visibility into the second half gives us confidence we can deliver mid-to-high teens EPS growth through the year. Looking to 2016 and beyond, we believe the combination of the benefits from current acquisitions, the momentum in our overall business and returns for employing future cash flows should drive solid double-digit EPS growth for many years to come and with that, to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the second quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue if time allows. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone.","Rich Noll","Hey Matt.","Matt McClintock","Rich, I have two questions. The first one, it sounds like everything\u2019s moving along according to plan with the recent acquisitions that you\u2019ve made. But it seems like there's has been a bit of a change of tone recently with share repurchases. Can you help us understand how you think about share repurchases, building? What you would say at what point would you try to execute a share purchase? What would you consider to be an excess amount of cash? How we should think about the mechanics of executing that program. Thank you.","Rich Noll","Sure. One of the great things about our business is we generate a tremendous amount of cash on a consistent basis. It\u2019s a hallmark for the company and our focus is to make sure we are using that cash to create great returns for you, our shareholders. We firmly believe that that will be best done with a mixture of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. And we've been doing a lot of -- the first two acquisitions, as well as instituting an increasing a dividend over time. And it's probably now becoming time for share repurchases to become a definitive part of that mix.","When you step back, I want to make sure that nobody hears this as saying we are doing this instead of acquisitions. That\u2019s clearly not the case. We can do both. In fact, when we look at our excess cash generation ability today and over the next 12 to 18 months, we could easily do a $1.5 billion of acquisitions and buyback stock consistently over that period of time. You can actually model out over the next couple of years. And you can find us being able to do billions of dollars of acquisitions and being able to buyback shares.","In terms of the near-term strategy, more likely than not, you'll see us begin to execute our share buybacks in 2015. While we have an authorization in place, we don't have any definitive plans, and Rick and I need to do a little bit more analysis on how much we would do and how we might start that program. Therefore, none of this is built into any of our guidance. But more likely than not, you'll see us begin to buy back some shares in 2015.","From an ongoing basis what is excess cash flow? I think you asked me to quantify it. If you think of our cash flow from operations of about $550 million this year less CapEx that we've talked about, less the dividend and you get to that $250 million to $300 million range on an ongoing basis. That could be a reasonable number. I\u2019m not committing to that in any given year, but that\u2019s the way to frame it. Great thing is we generate a lot of cash. We've got multiple ways to create value for shareholders and we want to use all of those ways to create value for shareholders.","Matt McClintock","Thanks. Rich. And then my second question if we could just dive into the softness in Innerwear this quarter. I know you mentioned last quarter some challenges at key retail partner in terms of inventory levels. Could you update us on what's going on there? What are you seeing overall in the Innerwear market? Is there, maybe is there increased competition, especially now that you seem to be getting more space gains with your higher ASP, Innovate-to-Elevate products such as X-Temp? Thanks.","Rich Noll","So let me just frame it overall and I will turn it over to Gerald to talk about some more specifics within basics and Innerwear. First and foremost, the overall macro environment isn\u2019t that great right now. In fact, when we look at both, our total Innerwear basics and intimates, we are seeing a deceleration of actually industry growth. In fact, basics has decelerated but still positive. Intimates is actually down. Given that in those environments we are gaining share, so our overall business is sound in terms of some of the tactics with the weakness in the near-term. I will turn it over to Gerald to talk about specifics.","Gerald Evans","Yeah. Overall, Matt, we had a positive trend in our Innerwear sales from Q1 to Q2 and driven by our basics business, which was up mid-single digits in the quarter. We fee real good about that. As Rich mentioned, the category and basics is growing. We are up a share point in the overall basics category and our underwear business is up 2 points. And it really is driven by the things you touched on. Our innovation, our strong brand position, we are gaining space and we went into back-to-school with very strong offers as we went into holiday period.","As we ended the third -- the first quarter, a major retailer had reduced their inventory and at that point, we viewed it as temporary. As we've gone into the second quarter, we\u2019ve learned, it is in fact more of a systemic change and they intend to use their new replenishment systems to manage their inventory more tightly going forward to pursue inventory turns. And so we reflected that in our guidance going forward. But we feel really good about this business. Those kinds of adjustments aside, we continue to gain space. We will gain more space in the second half of the year. Our share positions are growing and our innovations working. So, we feel very good about the basics business and its impact on Innerwear.","As we look at intimates, as Rich touched on as well. We gained share there as well in the core intimates business, but this category has accelerated decline quite dramatically and declined at a high single-digit rate in the most recent 12 month period.","So in addition, as we look at our business and addition to the category weakness, our results in the quarter were impacted as we executed the last of our brand transition strategy and department stores. We set about focusing on fewer bigger brands, our important brands in the channel and folding smaller brands like barely there into those brands.","So in the quarter, we managed down the last of our retail inventories and only at quarter ended, we begin to piper our new initiatives. As we look forward to Q3 and Q4, we\u2019ll continue that piping of initiatives and expense based behind those. So there again we feel really good about what we're doing in the category and in spite, what the category itself might be doing. We\u2019re doing the things we can do, putting great innovation behind our brands and really putting something in place that the consumers will buy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Hey, thanks guys. Couple of questions, so just to follow up on the replenishment business. Can you give us a sense for how big the difference is between what you're seeing in the sellthrough at these retailers versus what they are restocking and is there a big gap there? How long do you think this will persist? Are we looking at another three quarters to this kind of level and then I have a couple of follow-ups? Thanks.","Rich Noll","Yeah, in general, we see it\u2019s about $20 million -- approximately $20 million.","Rick Moss","Yeah. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen for far and we think there could be that on a go-forward basis. And that would be a couple weeks of supply out there and that\u2019s all built into our guidance and that's an important to remember. And what\u2019s to come more likely are going to be in the third quarter than not.","Omar Saad","Okay, great. Thanks. And then can you talk about what you are learning from DBA, give us an update on the international side. I kind of want to dive back to the original question on share repurchase versus acquisitions with the dollar so strong. I'm wondering if this is a signal that you are going to spend some time really working on integrating DBA before you go out and get -- make other kind of international acquisitions or can you just give us an update on what\u2019s going on there?","Rich Noll","Right. So let me first talk about capital allocations and acquisitions. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Gerald, excuse me -- to talk more about some specifics of how great things are going over in Europe. Do not read, absolutely do not read anything about share repurchases as being part of the mix as a negative about acquisitions. We are still absolutely focused on acquisitions, doing acquisitions and not changing the time frames in which we\u2019re thinking about acquisitions. No ifs, ands or buts, we can do both. It\u2019s a great thing about our company. In terms of how great DBA is going, Gerald?","Gerald Evans","Sure. From the standpoint of DBA, we couldn\u2019t be happy with how it\u2019s going. We\u2019ve got a very strong management team that\u2019s building their brand shares. They are controlling their cost and generating additional profits as you\u2019ve heard in the quarter. We've also begun to internalize some of our production. We've completed four of the five works councils and we have one more to do right on schedule. We\u2019ll complete it at end of our early fall and we\u2019ll begin integration in earnest in late in year. So everything is going well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.","Rich Noll","Hey Susan.","Susan Anderson","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the intimates category, so the minus 9, that you talked about, is this kind of a department store issue also, is that kind of where the industry was for the department store and then also maybe if you could talk about how -- it sounds like you guys are still maybe rationalizing, later forming, combining with your own brands. So is this -- I guess that this quarter and should we see a more combined brand, I guess, presentation going forward?","Gerald Evans","Susan, this is Gerald. The category numbers that I quoted are really total category and they are rolling 12 months for the core intimates excluding sports bras. And it is sort of across the various channels. From the standpoint of brand rationalization, the last of our managing done and transitioning of the inventories really is in this quarter. And we\u2019re piping our new initiatives behind our forward key brands late in Q2 and will do the balance in Q3 and Q4. So the rationalization is largely behind us and the focus on the key brands is ahead.","Susan Anderson","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the gross margin for the quarter, maybe, it sounded like Knights Apparel was a little bit of pressure or DBA probably help. Maybe if you could just parcel that out a bit between those two and then I2E?","Rich Noll","Sure. If you think about those two businesses, as we said one DBA businesses are structurally higher gross profit margins, probably about 10 percentage points higher than the Knights Apparel on the other hand had structurally lower gross margin levels. Probably that\u2019s 10 percentage points below our base business. So that 10 percentage point is higher for DBA. That percentage point is lower for Knights Apparel. And then in terms of the base business, particularly in the quarter, the improvement in the margin was almost exclusively from supply chain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Good evening guys. I want to circle back to the retail that you mentioned that steps down. I want to say, I think you said you came out in the middle of the quarter on a webcast and that you were feeling at that time was that had improved. Now you think that is a little bit more sticky, but how are you confident that it doesn't move down further this point for many conversations you may have had? And then also you said that I think you said that about $15 million or $20 million revenue reductions from FX, so if put those two together, it seems like maybe one or the other businesses will double a little bit within the guidance. Is there something to point us to there for our model?","Rich Noll","Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about through that cadence because I think you and I had that conversation when I was up at your conference. So when we ended last quarter, the retail inventories and basics, one of those retailers were talking about, they were down about three or four weeks versus the prior year when we ended Q1. By the end of April, they were actually almost flat. I think they were down, virtually flat.","So it'd come back strongly in April. By the time, we ended the quarter, their retail inventories were down about two weeks versus where they were at last year at that same time. So we saw a little bit of a reversal in May and June. So that's all built into our numbers. So it\u2019s probably impacted our total shipments and basics year-to-date about $20 million.","They in May and June communicated that they have had this new ordering system in place for of long period of time. And they feel they can now better optimize their turns. And so they're now talking about as a more structural change that was communicated to us. Gerald, I\u2019ll let you comment on it because you had some of the conversations with them. And they've given us indication they may take a little bit more weeks of supply out as they continue to fine tune their system a little bit. And that's one of the things we think may happen in the third quarter and we built into our guidance. Gerald, do you want to add any color to that?","Gerald Evans","Yes. They let us know that they have gained more confidence in their replenishment system that they intend to operate at little higher turn and that's what they've managed through their weeks of supply adjustment. And I think it's important to reiterate. This has nothing to do with our sellthrough.","This is really just matching shipments to our sellthrough at retail. And as they move their inventories up or in this case, now down more permanently, it\u2019s over one-time adjustment that happened and then our business should be trending back to where it should be.","Michael Binetti","And that we laughed at year round next year in the first quarter probably assuming right?","Rich Noll","Absolutely. Yeah.","Michael Binetti","Can you talk a little bit about the concentration promotional spending that you mentioned in the third quarter? What\u2019s the -- what are some of the components of that or what exactly that might be referring to?","Rick Moss","As we talk to you from time to time, we reiterate to you that there is volatility in our business from quarter to quarter. And one of the things that can be volatile, timing is freight promotional arrangements with our retailers and that\u2019s really we\u2019re talking about here. This shifts from one quarter to the next.","Rich Noll","Also highlight that one of the things that happened last year is we were going into this brand transition specifically as we are exiting the barely there brand which is some of the -- actually accounts barely there accounts for about half of the decline in intimates this quarter as we\u2019re exiting it. We gave some retailers additional markdown money in Q4 of last year to begin the process of marking that inventory down. So that when we were transitioning, there would be a smaller return this year. And so that was just part of the overall plan for our transition story and we won\u2019t overlap those straight dollars in Q4.","Michael Binetti","I apologize if I might sneak a third one in here. I apologize people are waiting in line but as far as acquisitions go, whenever we get out of a meeting with you guys, it sounds like list of potentials is very, very long, big, small, doesn\u2019t really matter. So as you think about that, it seems like at any given time, you could just pull the trigger, there should be like a subset of those that are at the price that you would, that you guys would find attractive. Can you talk to us about what are the impediments to getting a deal done on the near term now? What they take time frame on those kind of things?","Rich Noll","We get calls all the time. We\u2019ve got our own list of work we\u2019re working on. We\u2019ve got, we\u2019ve laid out our four acquisition criteria, which I won\u2019t go through again as I have talked about it so many times. So we feel really good about our ability to do acquisitions.","We don\u2019t just take anything that shows up by any stretched imagination. In fact, there are businesses that are for-sale or running processes or things like that, and we don\u2019t have any desire to just do an acquisition for acquisition sake.","That\u2019s why we have those four very disciplined acquisition criteria. And I feel good that there is a lot of companies out there that meet those categories that will allow us to continue this acquisition strategy for many years in the future and drive a lot of value.","We have constantly -- we\u2019re in communication with people. As I have said before, it took three years from initial contact with the Gear For Sports people until we actually did the deal, whereas something like Maidenform happened from initial contact to doing the deal nearly months.","So some of it\u2019s just opportunistic about exactly when somebody is ready on both sides and when everything gets aligned. And when we have a deal, we will let you know, but I feel good about it being part of our strategy. We are doing great with the acquisitions we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve got a lot of synergies yet to come and you will see more deals over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss","Yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about penetration of some more technical products and the basics portfolio progress you have made there. And if there are any fixtures to the new programs that are in place for the back half of the year.","Rich Noll","Sure. We may between ComfortBlend and X-Temp line, they now represent about 15% of our basics business, so that\u2019s stepped up from our protocol. And we see more space expansion coming in the second half of the year, particularly behind our X-Temp business, which is expanding very rapidly. They continue to perform well. And I think it just continues to speak to the power of innovation these categories. We are also beginning to push these into the outwear categories as well. So, continue to do very well.","Christian Buss","That\u2019s very helpful. And wondering if you could talk about works council negotiations for DBApparel a little bit?","Rich Noll","Yes. We\u2019ve actually completed four of the five. We have one left to complete in France, which we will complete we believe in early fall. And at that point, we will be complete with all of works council consultations. And then at least it\u2019s right on track as we\u2019ve talked about to begin major implementation in Q4, and you will start to see the synergies from that showing up in 2016 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen.","John Kernan","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking question.","Rich Noll","Sure.","John Kernan","So just on the operating profit guidance for DBA, it looks like you pick it up at $10 million. Is there some offset to that within your yearly guidance?","Rich Noll","Well, as we look at our guidance and our plans for the year, there are always puts and takes that we don\u2019t go into with you as we don\u2019t bridge turnaround plans. But in this kind of case, we are just trying to communicate that DBA is doing very well. They are performing at a level high -- little higher than we expected, which is a good thing, but again there are always puts and takes and as we go through the course of the year executing our plans.","John Kernan","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on that. Obviously the integration for Knights and DBA is really going to start to accelerate in the fourth quarter. As you look at those, this is a little bit longer. Are there any revenue opportunities you\u2019re seeing now and you\u2019ve been very specific about the profit opportunity for both, anything incremental on the revenue side for each?","Rich Noll","Yes. Certainly from the standpoint of DBApparel, I guess it\u2019s a nice operating platform as we complete our integrations to build out our brands and build our share positions within Europe. And we\u2019ve got some great brands to build upon. And even in Knights Apparel, it\u2019s a great compliment to our Gear For Sports business mix as a bigger player in the license, call it licensed apparel and allows us to compete more effectively in the retail channel. So we see growth opportunities in both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Group.","David Glick","Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up on DBA. Given your updated guidance, there is another approximately $64 million of operating income growth opportunity. And now that you\u2019re further into it, without asking you to fine tune it, but how do you think about the progression here? Is it linear until you hit your goal? Do you see some big quick opportunities next year? How do we think about the pace of the recognition of those synergies?","Rich Noll","David, we\u2019ve talked about being able to get that operating profit up to a \u20ac100 over time. We talked about three to four years from when we closed the acquisition, which was October of last year. In terms of the exact timing in '16 and '17, it\u2019s a little too early to comment on that. We haven\u2019t even begun our planning process for 2016 for the entire company little owned DBA. We need to get through the works council process to start to build our plans for next year and then we will give you a little bit more line of sight for that. I hate to jump out ahead of it.","David Glick","Fair enough. Back on intimates, are there any prospects? I mean, obviously, the businesses is tough out there, but are there any new product innovations once you kind of fill the pipeline here that you think could improve the trend versus the year-to-date? And it sounds like there is -- your guidance implies that you improve in the back half, but just wondered what the prospects were for turning around that business?","Rich Noll","Yes. I want to talk just about the macro environment and we talked about the overall category actually flipping negative and it\u2019s been like that now for a little bit of time. And as Gerald said, that\u2019s across all channels, specialty, department stores, mass, and everywhere. That\u2019s not going to last forever. At the end of the day, usages in that category haven\u2019t changed, so that there is normal ebbs and flows. I really do think that when you get outside of specialty and you look in department stores, mass, and mid-tier, one of the big issues has been there is way too many brands and way too many little ideas, and there is not big innovation that can help drive the category.","And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working hard to change this year after going after our four strong brands with very distinct positioning. We can drive big platform innovation behind those, just like we have in the underwear and the socks category with things like X-Temp and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s the thinking that can get that category to start act turning around. We need to get in that position and then act like a leader and we can actually help change the category trends.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole","Hey, good afternoon.","Rich Noll","Hey, Jay.","Jay Sole","Wanted to kind of follow up on the M&A. When you\u2019re out there looking to different deals, what\u2019s your sense of the competitive set that\u2019s looking at the same deals? Do you see that many competitor that could really compete with you about the kind of the strategic and the synergy opportunities you bring given that your own mostly own manufacturing and probably generally a lot of more cost savings and most of the people that might be bidding for these companies?","Rich Noll","I can only really talk about what we\u2019ve seen historically and because things could change over time, but I actually don\u2019t think so. At the end of the day, you hit it spot on is that we are going to have greater synergies than anybody else. And therefore, we\u2019ve got the capability of just creating a huge amount of value. And so for some of these deals you may see private equity be interested, but then when there is strategic around, they know that they are going to be a little bit sort of behind the [A ball] [ph] if you will trying to go after a property for that like that.","And then at the end of the day, there is not even that many big companies, apparel companies that had the kind of supply chain and capabilities that we do now across multiple continents. So there is not a lot of the same kind of competitive dynamics that you might see in some other industries or some with some other properties and other people pursuing them. We feel really good about our ability to integrate acquisitions and we are going to continue focusing on them as a great way to create value.","Jay Sole","Got it. And then if we can just shift to Champion for a minute. You talked about really strong growth in that brand. And can you just kind of detail some of the new program shipments, the sporting goods, and some of the reason that\u2019s happening now? And just remind us like what changed and where it\u2019s going to go from here?","Rich Noll","Well, I think Champion really did have a great quarter and part of that was shift in seasonal timing from Q1 to Q2, but a significant portion as well to the point you just made was new distribution, it\u2019s broad-based, it\u2019s across both men\u2019s and women\u2019s programs. And I think it\u2019s really approved for the bring of innovation to the brand but also the brand itself resonating. And it\u2019s sort to everyday athlete position. And so it\u2019s both women\u2019s and men\u2019s products and sports specialty and mid-tier department store expansion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Rich Noll","Hey, Bob.","Kevin Heenan","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob. I was just wondering if you guys had any commentary on how you are positions or how you think the consumer\u2019s position as you head into the back to school season, especially as you have the Knights Apparel business now in the mix? Thanks very much.","Rich Noll","I think we are well prepared for back-to-school in terms of the macro. I think there is a lot of speculation out there in the media about whether it\u2019s going to be a good back-to-school or a bad back-to-school or whatever. At this point, it\u2019s all speculation. We are just about to head into it literally starting this coming weekend and then strongly for the next six to eight weeks and I think, time will tell how the consumers responding and if they\u2019re coming out to buy. We feel good about our overall position, isn\u2019t that right?","Rick Moss","Yeah.","Gerald Evans","Absolutely, we do feel great about it, and you\u2019re right we\u2019ve got Knights now in the mix and they\u2019re positioned as well in that back-to-school period, which is big for them. So, we think we\u2019re in good shape.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Hope you are well. My question, I\u2019m hoping you can provide an updated view on the synergies associated with the three acquisitions in 2015? Are you finding more than you\u2019d expected previously and is that what\u2019s behind the higher guidance for the integration charges?","Rich Noll","No. We address the synergies first. The Maidenform is right on where we expected it to be, the -- we\u2019re in good shape there. With DBA, we begun to see just a little bit of the synergies, really when works councils are over we will begin to implement the integration plans and then we\u2019ll begin to see really the synergies, really effectively starting next year.","And Knights Apparel again just acquired and we\u2019re still working through the integration plan for them, which means we really wouldn't see a lot of synergies there until next year as well. So, again, I think, we\u2019re right on plan where we thought would be on synergies.","When you look at the [excise] [ph] charges that we have been talking about, let me take it from a couple of different perspectives. One, for the full year we went from 200 to 240 and that\u2019s due to DBA, our estimates on DBA, Maidenform, both are about the same.","We now are including, now that that have greater visibility of Knights Apparel and the integration plan that we think will be going in there, we better able to estimate what those charges might be.","That\u2019s about half of it and the other half comes from our decision in the second quarter to exit the China commercial business, which is about a $20 million charge, almost all which was non-cash. So that accounted for the $200 million to $240 million move to -- with DBA or Maidenform.","Jim Duffy","Okay. Is this split there still about one-third cash, two-third non-cash?","Rick Moss","Yeah. I mean this year especially yeah.","Jim Duffy","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from CLK & Associates.","Steve Marotta","Good evening, everybody. Just one question regarding the weakness in the innerwear, is there any increase in estimated promotional activity in the back half of the year? And can you talk a little bit about pricing in the back half and given the weakness in that segment?","Gerald Evans","Our pricing has been safe for some period of time. So certainly pricings are in place. So the standpoint of promotion activity, there's really no increase in activities. As Rick touched on earlier, there is some shifting of spending between quarters but no increase.","Steve Marotta","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella","Hi. I have a clarification question. Did you comment on how much you have outstanding and available under your revolver?","Rich Noll","No. As of the end of the quarter, we had nothing outstanding under the revolver excepts very small amount of credit. But the revolver is virtually entirely available to us.","Carla Casella","Okay. And maybe some follow-up here, your view on the capital structure, I know your high-yield bonds become callable later this year. And just wondering how you\u2019re looking the overall capital structuring and the amount of debt you\u2019re comfortable with?","Rick Moss","Well, as we\u2019ve said before, we really like the strong double-d credit rating and that suggests leverage ratio and that EBITDA leverage ratio of about two to three times. We feel very comfortable operating in that range. So as we -- specifically with respect to the bonds, they are callable on December of this year. We\u2019re always evaluating that. We haven\u2019t made a decision on what if anything we\u2019re going to do with them when they do become callable. That will be something later this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Thanks, guys for giving me a follow-up. Just wanted to ask a question back on this share repurchases. If I remember, I believe your purchase program goes back to 2007 and you really haven't done much in terms of repurchases over the last several years. And yet at the same time you've always generated a significant amount of cash flow. So what's really changed in the sense internally of why share repurchases are becoming more to the forefront, more part of the strategy going forward? Thanks.","Rich Noll","Matt, it\u2019s funny. The two most frequent questions that I\u2019m asked, first is when are we going to do the next acquisition? And that\u2019s actually included when we announce an acquisition. The next question I get is, when are you going to do the next one? The second most frequent question I get is, so when are you going to start buying back shares because you generate so much cash and right now if you don't do anything, your leverage ratio by the end of this year is going to be substantially below our target range.","And so, why are we starting to talk about it now, it\u2019s because more likely than not, time to begin doing it is now. When you look at what Rick just talked about is we\u2019ve got nothing on our revolver. Yet we ended the quarter with over $300 million of cash in the balance sheet. So, we knew we\u2019d start getting questions about well, you are just going to let that cash acumm, or what are you going to do with it to create value. I\u2019ve gotten those types of questions before.","So we want to be as we always do transparent, let people know how we\u2019re thinking. And most importantly that our goal is to make sure that we\u2019re creating the best return for you possible, with the use of our cash and that will include share repurchases and more likely sooner rather than later.","Matt McClintock","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today is a follow-up from the line of John Kernan from Cowen and Company.","John Kernan","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me jump back in. Just we\u2019ve heard a lot about the TPP legislation recently. Do you have any thoughts on how that\u2019s going to affect some of your cost coming out of your Vietnam on sourcing base?","Rich Noll","Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that. So we've been operating in successfully in Vietnam now for many, many years. We\u2019ve got close to 9,000 people and that\u2019s going to grow to 12,000 to 13,000 over time. So we\u2019ve got a strong head start on a lot of other companies in terms of being comparable on operating at Vietnam.","It\u2019s a great place to operate. It\u2019s low-cost for a lot of products into U.S. even under the current structure. It\u2019s also a great option for places like into Europe and elsewhere in the world. So it\u2019s great no matter what happens with TPP. If TPP does in fact pass, it can actually add an added benefit by reducing or actually eliminating duties on some of our products.","Those duties range from 6% to at most 17% and so it will open it up a little bit. Those things would probably get phased in over time, so it\u2019s not likely to be immediate impact but clearly it will make Vietnam more competitive. And I'll be glad that we\u2019ll have almost a decade head start relative to a lot of our competition. So it puts us in a good competitive position from a long-term perspective.","John Kernan","Okay. Great to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Hanes management for any closing comments.","Rich Noll","Great. That\u2019s all we have for today. Hope everyone has a good night. And give us call if you need help. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"10770":["Hanesbrands, Inc.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Hanesbrands fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.  (Operator Instructions).","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Charlie Stack, Chief Investor Relations Officer.  Please go ahead, Sir.","Charlie Stack","","Good afternoon everyone.  And welcome to the Hanesbrands quarterly investor conference call and webcast.  We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the fourth quarter of 2012.  Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.

","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer, Gerald Evans, one of two co-Chief Operating Officers, and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer.  ","For today's call, Rich will highlight a few big picture themes.  Gerald will provide a sense of what is happening in a few of our businesses.  And Rick will emphasize some of the financial aspects of our results.  ","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rich. ","Rich Noll","","Thank you, Charlie.  ","Normally, I start by discussing earnings, but not today.  Today, I want to stop and pause and talk about achieving a major milestone.  We ended the year with a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5.  2.5, that has been a long time coming and it feels really good.  ","Fifteen months ago, we told you we would reduce our debt substantially and we did.  Paying down \u00be of a billion dollars at a very short period of time.  The era of high leverage is now a thing of the past.  Going forward, we are targeting a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times.  We accomplished this monumental achievement by focusing on free-cash flow.  Both our profit and working capital improvement efforts are paying off.  In 2012, we generated $500 million of cash, the highest in our history.  And we expect another great year in 2013 generating $350 to $450 million.  In just these two years, we will generate more cash than in the previous five years combined.  And we are committed to using this cash wisely.  Over time, we will consider a mix of dividends, share buy-backs, and quickly accretive bolt on acquisitions to create further value for our shareholders.  ","Now turning to earnings, the back half of 2012 showed our true earnings power.  The operating margin of 13% demonstrates the benefits of our multi-year efforts of building our brand, filling our innovation pipeline, and transforming our supply chain to build a more profitable business.  More specifically, our leading brands remain strong and should only strengthen as we increase our media spending this year.  The innovation we have at retail and in the pipeline through our innovate to elevate strategy is contributing sales and importantly margins for 2013.  This strategy is designed to drive value added higher priced and higher margin items for both us and our retail partners.  And we're seeing the results as our core businesses are performing very well.  You'll hear specifics about all of these topics plus many more exciting initiatives at our upcoming investor day.  ","A year ago, we laid out our guidance for both 2012 and for 2013.  Not only did we hit our metrics for 2012, we are on track for 2013 raising this year's guidance to $3.25 to $3.40 per share.  When you combine this level of earnings with our low level of debt, we have truly improved our financial profile in a very short period of time.  ","To wrap up, 2012 was a very successful year under very challenging circumstances.  And we are coming out stronger, more innovative, and more profitable.  I believe we are only seeing the beginning of our true earnings power.  And I look forward to a successful 2013.  ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans","Thanks, Rich.  I am very pleased with our performance in 2012.  When we began the year, we had four clear goals.  First, to manage our pricing to navigate through the cotton bubble.  Second, to leverage our strong brands and innovation pipeline to accelerate growth and expand margins in our core categories.  Third, to de-risk our business by exiting the unprofitable segments of our U.S. image wear category and our European operation.  And our fourth and final goal was to optimize the performance of our supply chain to deliver additional cost savings and operate with lower inventory.  We accomplished them all.  And our momentum in the second half of the year demonstrates the full potential of our efforts.  ","Nowhere shows greater evidence of the power of our actions than inner wear, where we delivered progressively improving performance throughout the year culminating in a strong 7% sales increase and record operating margins in the quarter.  ","Our men's underwear category grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter and mid-single digits for the year.  Comparative price gaps, which returned to historical levels aided growth as did incremental sales driving by shelf space gains from innovative new products like ComfortBlend underwear and Slim Fit T-shirts.  ","I am delighted to tell you that our intimate apparel category was a particular bright spot in the quarter.  You may recall that two quarters ago, I discussed the early sales success we were seeing in our panty category as we up-rated our product offering and added space in our key customers.  The sales momentum in our panty category has continued achieving double-digit growth in the quarter.  ","Our work to revitalize our bra category started a little later.  And in the fourth quarter, we began to see the results of these efforts with bra sales up mid-single digits driven by our innovative Smart Side seamless bras and space expansions at several of our retail partners.  I am pleased with our momentum across intimates.  And anticipate continued growth in the quarters ahead.  ","For the full year, inner wear sales were up 3% despite a $40 million headwind from JC Penney.  Excluding that decline, inner wear sales grew 5% for the year.  Inner wear profit was up 18% for the year.  And the full year operating margin was an impressive 17%.  ","Turning to outer wear, sales also sequentially improved, up 6% in the quarter.  Champion, Gear for Sports, and Casual Wear also increases with Casual Wear posting growth of more than 20% driven by the launch of our Hanes BCT program.  ","For the full year, outer wear sales increased 6%, excluding the managed decline in our branded print wear category where we de-emphasized the more commoditized sector.  Outer wear's full year profitability was adversely affected by cotton inflation in the first half of the year, but showed substantial improvement in the back half.  We expect to see continued improvements here as we recognize lower cotton cost and realize the benefits of our strategy to drive our strong brands with a more profitable mix with a goal to have outer wear reach double-digit operating margins.  ","Let's now shift to international where we consistently perform below our expectations in 2012.  S we communicated last quarter, there are macro issues in certain countries that have slowed growth.  But there are also executional issues that we've identified.  Where in the past, we ran internationals as a collection of countries, we are now undertaking steps to take advantage of our regional scale, drive innovation, and better leverage our supply chain.  But we do not expect a return to double-digit growth this year.  ","Next, let me speak to the retail landscape.  Overall holiday sale through for our products was as expected.  We did see a different pattern at retail this year.  Where leading up to Christmas, many of our retailers saw relatively soft sales, but then ended strongly in the weeks following.  Retail inventories also finished in line with expectations.  Looking to 2013, we feel good about our own competitive situation.  But the overall consumer environment continues to feel mix causing us to be somewhat conservative when thinking about our top line growth.  ","As mentioned last quarter, the majority of our pricing is set for 2013.  For inner wear, wholesale pricing and pack counts are set for the year.  And our promotions are locked in through back to school.  ","In outer wear, pricing for our seasonal programs is locked in for the majority of the year.  We do expect branded print wear pricing to continue to drop in advance of lower cotton working through the supply chain as it did in 2011.  All of these assumptions have been contemplated in our guidance.  ","Also in our guidance is an increase in media spending of $30 to $40 million to further drive our already leading brands.  As a testament to the strength of our brands, the HanesBrand recently placed second in the Women's Wear Daily consumer survey of top 100 brands.  With cotton inflation behind us, we will invest in our brands and innovative new products to insure we remain number one in the minds of our consumers across each of our brand equity metrics.  ","Finally, I'd like to talk for a moment about our supply chain.  There are many lessons the industry is learning from the recent factory fires in Bangladesh.  One of these is that not all manufacturers adhere to high ethical standards.  Unlike most of the apparel industry, we produce approximately 90% of our annual units within our cell phone facilities.  We have employed a staff of professionals for more than 20 years that holds our factories and those of our vendors to the same high standards of corporate social responsibility no matter where they are located throughout the world.  Not only does this allow us to manufacture high quality products in our lowest cost manner, but it also allows us to create conditions for the workers that are both comfortable and safe.  It is clear that retailers are increasingly viewing this as an important advantage.  And are beginning to shift more business to vendors that they can trust to operate responsibly and ethically.  ","We are happy with the performance of our supply chain.  In particular, we are pleased with our success in Vietnam where we currently have about 8,500 employees, or roughly 70% of our Asian workforce.  We have seen Vietnam efficiencies exceed our expectations.  And that country is quickly becoming the central hub of our Asian supply chain.  ","So to wrap up, we are excited about the momentum we gained in the back half of 2012 and the actions we've taken to drive higher margin branded products.  Our strong brands, our innovate to elevate strategy and our world class supply chain are delivering strong results for Hanesbrand and for our retail partners.  We look forward to delivering another strong year in 2013.  ","I'll now turn the call over to Rick to discuss our financial performance.","Rick Moss","","Thanks, Gerald.  ","Before I review our results, let me take you back to my first call as CFO in November of 2011.  On that call, I laid out three key areas of focus.  Driving growth in our higher margin businesses, improving profitability in our underperforming businesses, and driving cash flow so that in turn, we could deleverage our balance to a level below three times debt to EBITDA.  We made tremendous progress in all three areas in 2012.  Inner wear grew.  Branded print wear was rationalized to become less volatile.  And we meaningfully de-levered the balance sheet.  ","To echo Rich's sentiment, I also want to celebrate the fact that in the last 13 months, we have paid down $750 million of long-term bond debt.  And brought our long-term debt to EBITDA ratio down to 2.5 times.  This is a significant accomplishment for our organization.  And I'm proud that we've kept our focus on generating strong free-cash flow to improve our risk profile.  ","Now let's turn to our results for 2012.  Sales for the full year were $4.53 billion, up 2% despite the challenging first half and a two point headwind to our growth from reducing the size of our branded print wear category combined with lower sales to JC Penney.  ","For the fourth quarter, sales increased 5% as the holiday period unfolded in line with our expectations.  And our momentum picked up through the back half of the year.  ","While gross margins were down for the year, I want to put this year's results in perspective.  When you look at the five year period preceding 2012, our annual gross margins have been very consistent plus or minus only about 40 basis points.  In 2012, margins were impacted by abnormally high cotton costs with most of the margin declines coming early in the year.  Gross margins returned to a more normalized level in the back half.  In fact, slightly higher than our five year average.  Our focus on driving higher margin businesses and improving the profitability of underperforming businesses should help us continue that consistency going forward.","For the year, SG&A was down $66 million as we benefitted from planned lower media and marketing spending and lower distribution costs.  SG&A in the quarter decreased approximately $9 million.  ","Operating margin for the year was 9.7%, down 40 basis points driven mainly by cotton headwinds in the first half.  However, our operating profit margins improved sequentially, 1% in the first quarter, 10% in the second quarter, and 13% in the back half of the year.  In the fourth quarter, all four segments achieved at least double-digit operating profit growth.  I'm very pleased with that momentum.  ","The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 10.3%, slightly lower than our guidance due to the impact of the debt pre-payment.  This is worth a couple of pennies to earnings per share, which put us just over the top end of our guidance at $2.62 for the year.  As expected, the back half of the year was very strong, and generated $2.18 of our $2.62 in earnings.  ","Turning to free-cash flow, we generated a record $508 million of free-cash flow in 2012 with solid business performance and a focus on reducing inventory.  With this free-cash flow, we prepaid approximately $550 million of a long-term bond debt in 2012.  And we intend to complete the remaining $250 million prepayment of our 8% notes later this year.","So let's turn to the 2013 guidance.  Our sales guidance for the full year is approximately $4.6 billion, or up about 2%.  It reflects our overall cautiousness on the current macroeconomic environment.  When you correct for the planned decline in branded print wear, we're planning the rest of the business up about 3%.  ","As a result of our pricing strategy and cost outlook, we have a great deal of confidence in our margin rates and achieving our operating profit guidance of $500 to $550 million.  At the midpoint of our guidance, the implied operating margin rate would improve about 170 basis points.  This improvement should be mainly driven by gross margin with SG&A slightly de-levering due to the increased media spending of $30 to $40 million.  ","Interest and other related expenses are expected to be $120 million, including approximately $15 million in prepayment expenses to retire the remaining $250 million of 8% notes.  ","The full year tax rate is expected to be in the teens.  But should fluctuate by quarter with the first and third quarter rates expected to be towards the lower end of the range.  And the second and fourth rates being at the higher end of the range due to anticipated discreet tax items including in the first quarter the impact of tax changes signed into law on January 2nd of this year.  These factors combined with the overlap of cotton inflation from 2012 should result in 2013 earnings growth that's more pronounced in the first half of the year.  ","Free-cash flow is expected to be $350 to $450 million including expected pension contributions of approximately $38 million and net capital expenditures of approximately $50 million.  As we pay off the remaining $250 million of 8% bonds, we should end 2013 with $1 billion in bond debt and a long term debt to EBITDA ratio towards the lower end of the 1.5 to 2.5 times range Rich mentioned.  ","In many respects, we are a very different company today than we were at this time last year.  At the end of 2013, we will have paid off $1 billion of debt in just 24 months all while successfully navigating through unprecedented cotton inflation.  We'll continue to drive our high margin businesses.  We've made necessary changes to exit those that are volatile and under-performing.  And our new normalized level of free cash flow of $350 to $450 million is stronger than it's ever been.  When you add it all up, our sales growth, EPS growth, and our strong cash flow, I'm feeling really good about 2013.  ","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Charlie.","Charlie Stack","","Thanks, Rick.","That concludes the recap of our performance for the fourth quarter.  Before we take your questions today, I'd like to remind everyone about our upcoming investor day at our headquarters on February 28th.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like to attend or have any questions regarding the event.  ","Now we will begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows.  Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your questions to one question plus a follow-up.  And then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.  I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session.  Operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question queue comes from the line of Susan Anderson  from Citi. The line is now open.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citi","","Hi you guys, and congrats on a really great quarter in Europe.","Rich Noll ","","Oh, thanks Susan.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citi","So, looking at your cash flow, it seems pretty amazing, and it seems to be exceeding your expectations also. So, after, you know, we get past kind of this cotton-giveback, where do you see that going longer term?  Is there more that you can take out of working capital to drive that further?  And then also, what the debt pay down coming to an end, can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on your capital priorities? I know you\u2019ve talked about, you know, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions. But not that we\u2019re kind of getting closer, do any of these rank higher on the totem pole?","Rick Moss ","","Sure. Let me take, this is Rick, let me take the first part of that Susan.  You know, in terms of, you know, the sustainability of free cash flow, particularly with respect to working capital.  We had \u2013 we made good progress in reducing inventories this year, a little over 350 million down.  You know, once you take the (diskoff) piece out of that, about half of the unit \u2013 or half of the decline in inventory was in units.  We think that\u2019s an important trend that we\u2019re going to continue to drive, do that we can continue to improve our inventory turns. And that\u2019s going to help over the next couple of years sustain this free cash flow. That, and as we continue to drive higher earnings.","Rich Noll","","Yes, so if you think of the 2013 probably is a more normalized level of cash flow to 350 to 450, right Rick?  ","Rick Moss "," ","Um-hmm","Rich Noll  ","","You know, then going into the second part of your question Susan, so what are we are going to do with it in 2014 and beyond? And I think it\u2019s really simple.  You know, first of all, we want to be really, really good stewards of capital and make sure that when we invest cash, we\u2019re going to get high returns for our shareholders.  That said, there\u2019s really only a couple of choices where we can return cash to shareholders through dividends and\/or share buybacks.","And [inaudible] acquisitions can also be a possibility. We purchased Gear a couple of years ago, that acquisition continues to play out fairly well.  We\u2019re overall pleased with its integration into our company and its long-term prospects. There can be other things such as that, that\u2019s in our core categories that we can use to leverage our global supply chain, reduce cost and justify any premium that we may pay. And we\u2019d also have a goal in mind of any type of acquisition where it would be relatively quickly accretive. ","So, those are also a possibility for the use of that cash flow going forward. I think \u2013 well, we don\u2019t need to do acquisitions to be successful. We have a lot of great opportunities on our own. But if those things play out, it could be a great way to create value. So, you\u2019ll see a mixture of those things I think play out over time.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citi","","Okay, great, that sounds good.  And then my last question is, just on your new product launches.  It seems like your Comfort Line has been really successful, and you\u2019ve been able to get higher prices for this. Do you think that\u2019s going help you get into \u2013 you know \u2013 I guess go more upstream to new distributions points?  ","And then also, maybe if you could talk a little bit about anything you have coming out on the innovation side for this year.","Rich Noll ","","Sure. We are definitely delighted with how our innovations are doing. The one thing we learned coming through the past couple of years is that, strong brands and innovations are what drives sales. And our ComfortBlend product continues to exceed expectations, and we\u2019ve just got a pipeline full of innovations coming through, and look forward to talking to all of you more about it at our Investor Day coming up later in February.  Because we really do believe that is the way to drive growth.","And we do continue to push our brands higher and higher. And each  brand is an incredible brand. Cuts across many channels of trade and performs very well. So, we\u2019re delighted about what we\u2019ve got in the innovation pipeline.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citi","","Okay, great. Thanks you guys, and congrats again.","Rich Noll ","","All right, thanks Susan.","Operator","","Next in queue we have the line of Eric Tracy from Janney Capital Marketing. There line is open for you now.","Eric Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. And all of my congrats particular on the debt pay-down.","Rich Noll ","","Thank you Eric.","Eric Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","So, Rich for you, maybe if you could just provide sort of a broader prospective on what you are seeing in the market.  Again, you mentioned sort of macro potential headwinds that are developing relative to sort of your visibility to the business clearly and where it is performing quite strongly.  But maybe just frame sort of the backdrop, and maybe how conservative that 2% sort of top line guide is?","Rich Noll ","Yes, let me just talk a little bit about that for a second. Because there\u2019s no one thing that, you know, we can point to that says, you know, let\u2019s be a little bit cautious here going into \u201913.  I think it\u2019s \u2013 you know, actually is here on the macro level housing looks like it\u2019s getting better, the stock market is doing better. Yet, when we talk to our retailers, I think since a little bit sometime before Christmas, they started being a little bit more cautious about 2013.  To be honest, I think a little bit more cautious than we\u2019ve probably heard them in the last 12 to 18 months or so. And I think a little bit of it had to do with the pattern of Christmas, and this is across a broad set of retailers.","Where things were a little bit slow before Christmas, but the week of Christmas and the two weeks after Christmas were unbelievably strong. So, everybody had a good Christmas overall, but made it right at the end. And so, it was \u2013 I think they were sort of a little bit nervous throughout the entire season.","And then I think everybody is just a little weary about what\u2019s going to happen with the tax increases, and importantly the delayed tax refunds to consumers, and is that going to impact spending.  ","So, when we hear our retailers being a little cautious, I think that in turn makes us just a little bit cautious, and we think it\u2019s prudent to be sort of at the lower end or our range that we were talking about before. ","Given that, though we feel very good about our prospects for the year. We feel very good about our margin increases, very good about operating profit cash flow earnings per share and so on.","Eric Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","And then yeah, I guess maybe my follow-up would then be the operating profit of 500 to 550 million.  What are the various, sort of puts- and-takes, you know that gets you at that low end of the high end?  It seems like [inaudible] or the marketing spend bill is relatively now.  I guess the first question is, is that fair in terms of the expected marketing spanners, or could that flex depending on the environment?","And then, you know, what are the different sort of puts-and-takes on the gross margin? Is it supply chain manifestation pricing that could potentially come through, to sort of drive that delta between the 500 and 550?","Rich Noll ","","Yes, Eric, this is Rich.  Let me start with the high level question, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick to talk a little bit more specific about some of those.","But it think one of the important things I want to communicate in terms of our overall ability to get to our higher level of operating margin goal of 12 to 14%, is this innovate to alleviate strategy is an important part of that in terms of increasing margins. So for us, we got the traditional cost reductions that we\u2019ve talked about historically, but the idea of getting products with features that consumers desire more and are willing to pay a little bit more for, is also part of our margin increase strategy, both on a pennies per unit, as well as a percent basis.  ","And so, some of the flex that we\u2019re talking about is exactly when these new products his, exactly how strong they are in the first couple of months, and so the stronger they are, the slightly \u2013 you know, it\u2019s going to have a slightly more positive impact on our margin. And that\u2019s sort of at a very high level.  ","Rick, if you want to talk more about some of the specifics of \u201913.","Rick Moss ","","Sure. I think I would narrow some of the flexibility dwindling the 5 to 550 down to a couple of things. One is, as Rich indicated, the success of some the new products that have higher margins. The more successful those will be, the more margin expansion we\u2019ll get from that. And that\u2019s really the, you know, one of the key benefits from that.","I think though that also we have a lot of cross optimization initiatives that we\u2019re undertaking right now. I think the more successful those are, the higher \u2013 the more we\u2019ll be at the higher end of that range.","And then as you said, the [inaudible] 30 to 40 million, that\u2019s pretty fixed. ","Eric Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, I appreciate it guys. ","Rich Noll ","","Thanks.","Operator","","Next in queue we have the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research. There line is open for you now.","David Glick -  Buckingham Research","","Thank you. Rick, I just had a question that maybe you can help us think about how the year unfolds. I mean, certainly you talked about first half earnings growth being, you know, the year being first halfway. When you\u2019re up against an EPS loss in the first quarter, obviously and you look at the first quarter of 2011, you know, that\u2019s a huge swing.  ","So, if you could help us think about how we \u2013 without, you know, being specific on [inaudible] guidance obviously, but how to think about the revenue trends as the year progresses, as well as, you know, gross margin. Whether we should think about that on a static basis, on the gross margin line, are there any? You know, you mentioned Q1 sales, you know, the bigger impact on [inaudible] being in Q1.  Just help us think about how the year unfolds maybe a little more specifically.","Rick Moss ","","Sure, let me walk you down the P&L. The key items on the P&L and give you a sense of where there may be some variability through the course of the year. As you rightly pointed out, David, the (Branded Print Wear) sales declines will occur primarily in the first quarter, about a half, may be a little less than half in the first quarter, but certainly mostly in the first half.  So you need to factor that in.","As you think about gross margin, think about it being more stable in 2013 than it was in 2012, though we tend to have a little bit lower margin in the first quarter because it\u2019s our \u2013 well a sales quarter. So, your fix cost tend to play in a little bit more there.","But after that, you should see a lot less variability quarter-to-quarter, though again, we had very high cotton cost last year in the first half, and those won\u2019t repeat.","As you think about SG&A, I would think about the key driver there as being the 30 to 40 million of additional media spend, two-thirds of which will come in the back half of the year.  So that will be kind of the key driver there.","I\u2019ll point out a couple of other things though. One, is our debt prepayment charge will be about $15 million, so that will come in probably in the fourth quarter. So the other $105 million of interest expense will be pretty flat, or will be pretty even for the rest of the quarters.","Then finally, we do talk about some tax rate variability. The tax law that was signed on January 2nd gives us about $5 to 6 million of benefits that we are required under the Accounting Rules to recognize, specifically in the first quarter.","David Glick -  Buckingham Research","Okay. And any chance that that December prepayment could come any earlier in fiscal 2013?","Rick Moss \u2013 CFO","It\u2019s certainly possible.

","Rich Noll","","We can now.  ","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Okay, thanks, guys.  Good afternoon.  So I wanted to ask you a question on the top line.  You know, it sounded like you kind of \u2013 international is still going to be a little bit of a transition year, it sounds like you\u2019re repositioning how you\u2019re approach those markets and maybe a little bit more on a market-by-market basis as opposed to a broader approach.  How do you think \u2013 what is apparent when you think about topline growth from here?  Obviously it\u2019s been pretty good the last couple of years despite existing some of those businesses.  Should it be some sort of mix of price and some market share gains and kind of natural GDP growth, you know, and then when international \u2013 and then hopefully comes on line in a couple years, is that the right way to think about it?  Where are the big revenue opportunities for Hanesbrands? ","Rich Noll","","You know, Omar, we\u2019ve always talked about organic growth for us with 3 to 4% total company growth that with that kind of growth you get a little bit of share gains, which really comes from shelf space.  The categories tend to modestly grow, but we can magnify that, you know, in a greater rate of operating profit growth through both our optimization and our innovation and elevate strategies at a much faster rate, and then with our strong cash flow we can go from operating profit down to EPS at a much faster rate.  So we\u2019ve always said that 3 to 4% of organic growth for us can easily translate into double digit EPS growth for a very, very long time to come.  And that model hasn\u2019t changed at all.  ","Omar Saad - ISI Group","But diving into the top line piece, Rich, you mean, with cotton inflating again, should we think about inflation as a steady piece of that, like on the revenue, understanding the P&L and how much leverage you guys can generate against it, where do you see like the big chunks of topline opportunities for the company, or is it just a little bit of shelf space, a little bit of\u2026","Rich Noll","","Yes.  So you want to think about it as this is a game of inches, right, every little bit counts. You know, so you margin up a little bit on this product, you gain a couple of feet of shelf space this year in this account and this product category.  You know, we\u2019re so broadly distributed, each and every year you\u2019re just making a little bit of progress.  Inflation will work into that. Over time, clearly, the area of \u2013 era of deflation in apparel industry is now over.  It\u2019s obviously got a little more lumpy in the short term but I think over time that will contribute a little bit.  And you know, so for us, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to piece together a consistent 3 to 4% topline growth and we feel good about those prospects.  ","Now, obviously, if you step back and you start to say, look, do you make an opportunistic acquisition here or there and use the \u2013 if we can get it at a good price, that\u2019s obviously going to fuel that topline growth at a faster rate.  So when you do that, you\u2019re going to have a year where you\u2019re going to be a little bit higher or substantially higher than that.  So you could get to even high single-digit growth rates, you know through acquisition.  But just raw organic growth, topline is 4% and that\u2019s all we need to make this whole model work for us.  ","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Understood.  Thank you.  ","Operator","","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel Nicolaus and their line is open for you now.  ","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you.  Nice job, guys.  Congratulations on the execution through a challenging period. ","Rich Noll","","Thank you.  ","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","I\u2019m going to build on Omar\u2019s question.  Rich, could you maybe put some shape around some of those ongoing efficiencies and cost optimization savings opportunities for \u201913?  What are some of the biggest areas of opportunities?  What\u2019s the total size of the opportunities when you look out over the course of the year? ","Rich Noll","","Yeah, Jim, we\u2019ve always talked about we can continue to make optimizations savings with 30 or $40 million a year overtime.  That will tend to decline.  We\u2019ve also got margin opportunities we\u2019ve talked about from innovate to elevate.  So we feel that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to continue to have those margins increase.  Any one particular one, again, it\u2019s a lot of \u2013 within the four walls, as we take out inventory and improve our turns, we\u2019re able to make labor more efficient, we\u2019re able to rationalize a few facilities here and there and continue to strive our cost and improve productivity.  ","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay.  And then in the prepared remarks, you highlighted the Vietnam efficiencies.  Is there any shift of manufacturing between geographical regions that\u2019s contributing to some of the efficiencies that you\u2019re seeing?  ","Rich Noll","","No, we just really continue to build out Vietnam and the Asian part of our supply chain came on later and that\u2019s the piece that we\u2019ve been ramping up.  But you know, just to reiterate, we\u2019re delighted with how that\u2019s going.  It couldn\u2019t be more efficient.  It\u2019s just fantastic.  ","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","I see.

That line if open for you now.","Bob Drbul ([inaudible]) Barclays Capital","Hi, good afternoon.  It\u2019s [Inaudible] on for Bob, and congratulations on the quarter.  ","Bob Drbul ([inaudible]) Barclays Capital","Just to talk a little bit more about the price strategies that you\u2019ve locked in for 2013 so far, how do those compare to what you did in 2012 on the increasing pack sizes versus bringing prices down and where have pricing levels sort of fallen out at this point compared to where they were at their peak?  ","Gerald Evans","","Sure, hi, this is Gerald.  Just, you know, first of all, having come through the past couple of years and all the challenges in cotton pricing, our first focus now is to really reinvest in our brands and our innovations.  We clearly learn that\u2019s the way to drive sales.  So that\u2019s our first objective is we come out of that period.  ","As we look at pricing though, you really have to sort of look at the pieces of our business to understand \u2013 to really answer that question.  If you look at our underwear business, that pricing is largely \u2013 is in place effectively for 2013.  The wholesale pricing is set.  Our pack sizes are set.  We put those in place later \u2013 in the latter part of last year and those are set.  And really, our promotions are set through Back to School.  ","Our outerwear business is very much in the same way.  When we look at the retail portion of our outerwear business we have seasonal programs that we set prices with our retailers and effectively, for 2\/3s of the year, those are set and we\u2019ll be setting the balance of those prices over the next few months.  ","The one business is our branded printwear business and in this business, prices do tend to change constantly and they tend to change \u2013 as cotton falls, prices tend to fall before them.  We saw that in 2011, we\u2019re already beginning to see some of that in the branded printwear category now and it\u2019s certainly one of the reasons that we began to de-emphasize portions of that business last year.  It only represents about 3% of our total business today, but that is the one where we see some pricing activity and we\u2019ve built that in our guidance.  We\u2019ve anticipated that in our guidance.  ","Bob Drbul ([inaudible]) Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks, Gerald.  And then what have you seen also in terms of promotional activities during fourth quarter in the competitive environment heading into this year and how did that compare to last year? ","Gerald Evans","","It really played out as we expected.  I think it sort of reflected the generally higher prices that the market had moved to at that point in time, but generally played out as it had in prior years from the number of events and so forth.  ","Bob Drbul ([inaudible]) Barclays Capital","Okay, thank you.  ","Operator","","Next in queue we have the line of Scott Krasik from BBT Capital Markets.  Their line is open for you  now.  ","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks.  Hey, gentlemen, congratulations.  ","Gerald Evans","","Thanks, Scott. ","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Just \u2013 I guess, two question.  One is sort of a numbers question and the second one is big picture.  In terms of the first quarter, I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance, but you know, the range goes from about $0.15 to $0.50 cents with a mean somewhere in the mid-30s.  So you know, is the mean sort of in line or could you point us in one direction or the other?  And then the second question, Rich, you did a great job growing shelf space even with the lower marketing spend.  As you get back into a phase of spending a little bit more, you know, should you expect to capture some benefit from the marketing spend and how are you able to capture share even with [inaudible]?  ","Rich Noll","","So I\u2019ll let Rick not answer the first question, Scott, and then I\u2019ll answer the second.  Go ahead. ","Rick Moss","I\u2019ll find a polite way not to answer your question, Scott.  No, in Q1, I would, again, reiterate a couple of things that you should keep in mind.  So the brand printwear business will have a negative impact on sales.  However, it will not have a material impact on profitability because you know, the sales that we\u2019ve gotten away from were less profitable or unprofitable sales.  ","We will see a significantly \u2013 in the first quarter of last year, our cotton costs were in the mid-180s and they\u2019ll be substantially below that in the first quarter of this year.  And don\u2019t forget to factor in the 5 to $6 million of reduced tax expense in the quarter. ","Scott Krasik - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.  ","Rich Noll","","In terms of a bigger picture question on media and how it relates to sales and so on, and you know, really, the impact of media is cumulative over time.  It\u2019s not something that is going to drive your sales in the short term.  You know, we\u2019re \u2013 you know, at our heart, we\u2019re really a packaged goods company that also sells apparel and so when we approach talking to consumers and innovation, it\u2019s not just an art, it\u2019s also a science.  We have models that can tell us, you know, how effective TV advertising is, how it\u2019s going to impact purchase intent, how it\u2019s likely to increase your sales over time and we understand a lot of those metrics.  And what you\u2019re able to do, you can pull back for a year or so and you\u2019re not going to have a detrimental impact, but you can\u2019t \u2013 then you\u2019re going to have a long-term problem if you stay at those reduced levels.  ","So we\u2019re really getting back to a more normal level.  I think you\u2019re seeing the benefits of all those media spins over the year.  It\u2019s why we were able to navigate all of those high-cost cotton and increase prices when we needed to, put out there with innovation and higher price points.  It\u2019s a cumulation of the efforts of our innovation coupled with consumer advertising.  And so it\u2019s going to continue to allow us to have a healthy sustainable business going forward.

Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. For the quarter, Hanes delivered revenue, operating profit and earnings per share that were at the midpoint of our guidance, while operating cash flow came in ahead of plan. Overall, the year is unfolding as expected. We reiterated our full-year guidance and we remain well positioned for accelerating revenue, profit and cash flow growth in the second half.","At our Investor Day in May, we spoke about our efforts over the past several years to reinvigorate our Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy by diversifying our business to become a more global company, one that's able to fully capture the leverage and power of our global supply chain. This strategy is designed to return the business to more consistent organic growth, further improve profitability by leveraging our increased scale and generate significantly higher levels of cash flow. And our progress continued in the second quarter with strong performance across our key growth initiatives.","Consumer-directed sales increased to 22% of total sales, including double-digit growth online. Global Champion sales grew high-teens and International revenue increased mid single-digits on an organic constant currency basis. For the total company, organic constant currency revenue was up modestly in the quarter, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of growth, as we outperformed our projection for a first half decline.","We're on track to deliver higher levels of organic revenue growth in the second half, driven by continued growth in our key initiatives, as well as the strong reception we're seeing to our latest product innovation, our alignment with key retailers for the back-to-school selling season and our action plans to stabilize our U.S. Intimates business. We're also making progress on improving profitability and remain well positioned to return to margin expansion.","Acquisition synergies are tracking to plan. The expected first half cost headwinds from marketing investments and distribution costs are essentially behind us, and we should see margin leverage from increasing organic growth. In terms of cash flow, GAAP earnings are on plan, putting us firmly on track to deliver our cash flow guidance for the year.","Looking at the quarter by product category, global Innerwear sales increased 1% over last year, driven by acquisition contributions and currency benefits. On an organic constant currency basis, sales declined roughly 2.5%, driven by a 3% decline in the U.S. Overall, the U.S. Innerwear business performed in line with our prior outlook.","In the quarter, our Basics business delivered growth, driven by improving point-of-sale trends, a low single-digit increase in men's underwear and a solid return to growth in women's underwear. This more than offset the expected short-term pressure from door closures. We're seeing strong reception to our latest innovation Comfort Flex Fit. In aggregate, innovation products now represent 20% of our Basics revenue.","With respect to our Intimates business, while revenue declined compared to last year, which we expected, our growth plan remains on track, as we're beginning to see positive sell-through trends associated with our space gains and new program launches. Global Activewear sales increased 12% over last year. On an organic constant currency basis, sales increased 6%, as strong growth in Champion as well as growth in our licensed sports apparel business more than offset the expected declines in the U.S. mass channel.","At Investor Day, we highlighted that within Activewear, we're seeing an ongoing convergence of casual and performance apparel and the consumers are demanding brands with athletic authenticity. Over the past several years, we have driven a brand-elevation strategy for Champion to capitalize on these consumer dynamics. We have reunited the brand globally, allowing us to coordinate product design around the world.","We've significantly increased our investments, including engaging directly with the consumer through digital platforms, and we're expanding our global points of distribution, including our owned branded stores. These elevation efforts are paying off and have driven strong demand for the brand across geographies, across product categories and across channels. Global Champion sales in constant currency have grown at a mid to high-teens rate in each of the past four quarters, with all of the growth coming from outside the U.S. mass channel.","Excluding the U.S. mass channel, Champion's constant currency growth has been in the high-20% to low-30% range over the last four quarters. Moreover, growth outside the mass channel continued to accelerate in the quarter, increasing 33% globally. And in the U.S., growth accelerated to over 70%, up from 50% in the first quarter and 40% in the second half of last year.","Looking forward, we believe the strong momentum of our Champion brand-elevation initiative will continue to drive growth in existing accounts, as well as distribution expansion in new accounts, new geographies and our owned retail stores, positioning us to achieve $2 billion of Champion sales by 2022 outside of the mass channel.","Turning to acquisitions, as we highlighted at our Investor Day, our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring businesses that, when integrated, provide additional revenue growth opportunities, significant profit improvement by leveraging our company-owned supply chain, as well as additional management talent. Our most recent acquisitions, Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things, both fit this mold. These are very well-run companies with strong management teams and attractive growth profiles. Integration actions are well underway and are tracking to plan.","Acquisitions remain a key part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. Over time, we believe a balanced approach to capital allocation through reinvestment, dividends, buybacks and acquisitions will drive sustainable high returns for our shareholders. And as you heard last quarter and again at our Investor Day, our short-term focus is on reducing our leverage to get back within our stated long-term range of 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA.","So, to wrap up, the quarter was right in line with our expectations and the year is unfolding as we expected. We remain focused on executing our long-term strategy to unlock our full cash flow potential. Our revenue diversification efforts are working, as we have delivered multiple quarters of organic growth. We're well positioned to return to margin expansion in the second half, with additional opportunities to further improve profitability by leveraging our global scale. And we're committed to reducing our acquisition charges as well as our leverage, all of which is expected to generate significant cash flow growth over the next several years.","Before I turn the call over to Barry, I'd like to briefly touch on this morning's announcement. We announced that Target made the decision not to renew the contract for our exclusive C9 by Champion program in Activewear after the current agreement expires January 31, 2020. The C9 program is fully booked for 2018 and is reflected in our 2018 guidance, and we don't expect our C9 business in 2019 to be meaningfully different from this year. Hanes and Target are proud of their partnership and remain focused on providing a great experience during the C9 transition.","Today's announcement does not affect the balance of our ongoing Target business, where we look forward to continuing our longstanding partnership of driving mutual growth with our leading national brands. As we look out over the next several years, the progress we're making across our multiple growth initiatives, including Champion, as well as our diversified global business leaves us well positioned and gives us great confidence that we can achieve all of the long-term goals we set at our Investor Day.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. At our Investor Day, we outlined our long-term strategies to deliver organic revenue growth, improve profitability, grow cash flow and increase shareholder returns over the next five years. We are executing on our strategy and we're tracking to the goals we laid out in May. We have delivered quarterly organic growth over the last year, and we are positioned to deliver higher levels of organic growth in the second half, driven by demand for our Champion brand, improving trends in U.S. Innerwear and the strength of our diversified global business.","With respect to profitability, we project a return to margin expansion in the second half. Acquisition synergies are building. Transitory costs that impacted the first half are behind us. Organic growth will drive leverage and we'll have modest pricing benefit late in the year with increasing price benefits expected in 2019. Cash flow is on track to grow in 2018 and beyond. Over the next few quarters, we expect to lower leverage into our target range, and then we'll be well positioned to deploy increasing cash flow to shareholder-friendly activities.","Looking at 2018, for the quarter, sales were $1.72 billion, an increase of $69 million over last year and up 10 basis points organically in constant currency. Operating profit was $245 million and operating margin was 14.3%. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.45 and $0.39 respectively. Sales, operating profit and EPS were all right at the midpoint of our guidance range. In the quarter, we generated $64 million of cash flow from operations, which was ahead of plan.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 4.2% over last year and included $52 million from the contributions of our recent acquisitions of Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things, as well as a $16 million benefit from the effects of foreign exchange rates. The dollar strengthened versus our last guidance and resulted in $12 million less benefit than what was embedded in our guidance.","Gross margin declined 40 basis points over last year, as expansion in our International gross margin was offset by higher input costs as well as product mix within our Innerwear segment. In the quarter, we experienced $11 million of raw material inflation. Absent this inflation, our gross margin was up 30 basis points. Operating margin declined 150 basis points compared to last year, right at the midpoint of our guidance range, as we made planned investments to support our brands and growth strategies, as well as experienced the transitory costs we previously discussed.","Absent the impact from raw material inflation, operating margin declined 80 basis points. For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges were $25 million, in line with our guidance and represented a decrease of $1 million from last year. We are making good progress on our initiative to complete ongoing integrations, and we continue to project that all integration charges for prior acquisitions will end during 2019.","Now, let me take you through our segment performance. U.S. Innerwear sales declined 3% compared to last year, in line with our prior outlook. In the quarter, Basics revenue increased 50 basis points and Intimates declined, both consistent with our expectations. We're on track for Intimates to return to stability by the end of the year. We're seeing early signs of progress as we continue to implement our action plans.","Our new bra programs are performing well, we have gained space in the mass channel and we are seeing a corresponding increase in point-of-sale. In addition, our new shapewear products, which include new cooling innovations, will begin shipping in the third quarter. While Innerwear margins declined 180 basis points compared to last year, the rate of decline improved from the first quarter. We experienced higher raw material costs and product mix headwinds principally in our Basics business.","U.S. Activewear segment sales increased 7% over last year due to the $20 million contribution from Alternative Apparel and a 1.5% increase in organic sales. The organic sales increase exceeded our expectations, as growth in Champion and licensed sports apparel more than offset the previously disclosed space declines in our mass business. Activewear's operating margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter to 14.2%, an improvement from the first quarter due to the scale benefits from Champion's growth. As compared to last year, favorable product mix was offset by higher raw material costs, start-up manufacturing inefficiencies and higher distribution costs.","Our International segment sales increased 15% or $71 million with $31 million from the contribution of Bras N Things and $16 million from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, organic sales increased 5% compared to last year, driven primarily by Champion growth in Europe and Asia. International operating margins increased 140 basis points over last year to 14% due to leverage and the continued realization of acquisition synergies.","Now, moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items, in the quarter, we generated $64 million of cash flow from operations, and consistent with normal seasonality, for the first half, cash flow from operations was a use of $64 million. First half cash flow performance was better than we planned, driven by working capital performance. Inventory was up year-on-year, in line with our second half guidance for sales and includes the balances from our recent acquisitions.","Accounts receivable was up in line with sales. Cash cycle improved seven days from the same period last year, driven by both payables and inventory days. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 3.9 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis, which was consistent with the prior quarter. We expect to be approaching the high-end of our target leverage range of 2 to 3 times by year-end, and as we move through 2019, we expect to be back within our target range.","Turning to guidance, since our last update in May, the dollar has strengthened, creating a $30 million revenue headwind in the second half as compared to our prior guidance. Despite this headwind, we reiterated our full-year outlook for revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. We continue to expect acquisition contributions of $180 million.","Given the strong performance of our key growth initiatives, we now expect organic revenue growth for the full-year to be slightly better than our prior 1% projection. As it relates to our full-year operating profit, our guidance reflects the impact from the stronger dollar. Our outlook also continues to include approximately $35 million of net input cost inflation, $30 million from acquisition contributions, as well as the benefits from acquisition synergies and cost savings initiatives.","With respect to our third quarter guidance, at the midpoint, our revenue outlook reflects an $18 million headwind from exchange rates, acquisition contributions of approximately $55 million and organic growth of 2%. We expect U.S. Innerwear sales to be down between 1% and 2%, reflecting growth in Basics and improving trends in Intimates. We expect organic constant currency growth in U.S. Activewear and International.","In terms of operating margin, at the midpoint, our third quarter guidance implies approximately 30 basis points of margin expansion and reflects acquisition synergies, leverage from organic growth, as well as price increases for certain seasonal programs. This is offsetting higher input costs, which are trending to our initial expectations, as well as slightly elevated distribution costs to support Champion's accelerating growth.","So, in closing, we're pleased with the way the year is progressing. We're well positioned for accelerating revenue, profit and cash flow growth in the second half, and we feel good about our full-year guidance. Looking forward, as we highlighted at our Investor Day, we're focused on executing our long-term strategies to generate significantly higher levels of cash flow and improving shareholder returns over the next several years.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and nice job on the quarter. I guess I wanted to maybe drill down a little bit, if you could provide any more detail on Target exiting C9 and just any thoughts around why they didn't want to renew the contract. And then also if you thought there could be other retailers that potentially could take the exclusive brand, and then maybe if you could just map out the growth you expect from Champion by region or distribution channel to offset this, that would be great. Thank you.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure, Susan. Good morning. It's Gerald. Let me start with just a quick overview of our business and how we're feeling about the core, because we feel really good, as you suggested, about how the quarter went. The year is really unfolding in total as we expected, our diversification across geographies and channels and customers is working, and we came in right at the midpoint of our guidance in revenue, EPS and operating profit.","And so, feel good about the start, feel good about the fact that we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth and better than frankly our outlook for the first half of a slight decline. So, real good, reaffirmed our guidance for the year, as you heard in our comments as well, and expect organic growth to continue to accelerate, including late in the year in the fourth quarter seeing U.S. Innerwear come back to organic growth. So, again, feeling very positive about the year and all that we're seeing about accelerating of the business.","Specific to your question about the C9 program, let me just reiterate first what I said in my comments that this is an exit of a contract that ends in January 31, 2020. So, we will work together for another two years frankly from the standpoint of executing that business. The 2018 business is fully booked and is in our guidance, and as I mentioned in my comments, we don't expect the 2019 volume to be materially different than what we're doing in 2018. It's a long-running partnership. It's over 15 years old. It was one of our original growth initiatives in the Champion business, actually pre-spin for us, and it's been a wonderful experience for us. But as businesses do, they do mature over time, and this one has certainly begun to mature, the fantastic product out there, but it has begun to mature.","Specific to Target strategies, I need to leave that to Target to speak to. But what I can tell you from our side of things on the Champion business is that we've been evolving the Champion business over the last few years from what was a domestic business with a maturing mass component to a global growth story, and it's been through our elevation strategy. And it started with repurchasing the Champion Europe business and the Japanese licensee, and we evolved our business from a U.S. business to one that's now a global business selling across multiple channels and creating a number of avenues to growth.","And you're seeing it in our numbers. You heard the numbers. I mentioned that in this year, we've seen four consecutive quarters of mid to high single-digit growth at a constant currency basis. And importantly, as we've evolved this business, now the vast majority of it is outside the mass channel. And when you exclude the mass channel from those numbers, the numbers have been in the high-20% to low-30% growth rate for the last four quarters, and in this past quarter, it was actually 33%. So, you see a nice ramping and it's going on globally. It's over 70% growth outside mass in the U.S., 31% in Asia and 30% in Europe.","So, we see the momentum building. We think it's a natural evolution for channels to shift as we go down this path. And as we look forward, we see the strong momentum of our Champion elevation initiatives will continue to drive us in our existing accounts, and we see new accounts coming on every month and we see our geographies expansion potential as well as driving our own retail stores. So, as I noted in my comments, we feel well positioned to continue on our path toward our $2 billion goal by 2020 outside of the channel, and we have clear view to that momentum continuing.","If we look at our bookings for the second half of this year, which we now have view to, we can see that the momentum continues into the second half outside of the mass channel in spite of us now overlapping some pretty strong growth trends in the latter half of last year. And even as we now get initial signs of our programs in 2019 for spring, we're getting very favorable responses. So, we're very excited about Champion. I can see it in the enthusiasm in my global Champion teams. There's a lot of momentum building and we feel great about the potential for Champion in the years ahead.","Susan Anderson - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Great. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the details, and the product does look good in the specialty channel. Just one more, if I could squeeze in there on the Intimates side. So, it sounds like you expect some stabilization in the back half. Maybe if you could expand on those action plans, and was the pressure in the first half, was it more related to the department store door closures or was it the mass channel too? Just trying to figure out if this is kind of a problem within the department stores or more of a brand \u2013 I guess a brand and space problem. Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great follow-up question, and we are on track with our Intimates stabilization plan. And it has been \u2013 it is a multi-quarter plan, as we've talked about, and we expect it to truly reach stabilization in the fourth quarter. To your channel question, some of our early initiatives were to launch some new initiatives in the mid-tier department store and in the mass channel, and we're seeing both of those demonstrate positive POS as they go into place.","There were more door closures in the department store and mid-tier channel, and we overlapped those \u2013 the last of those in the third quarter. So, that's an important overlap as we look to our stabilization as well. And it was more a headwind certainly in that area where the door closures were. But another key big initiative for us is, is in the third quarter, we relaunch our shapewear programs within both key mass customers as well as mid-tier customers, and that includes the new innovations including our cooling shapewear items. So, as \u2013 we think as we overlap this quarter and get those in place and overlap the door closures, we're well positioned to stabilize the business in Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. A couple questions for me. First, you've called for an inflection in the Innerwear segment before year-end. Do you have sight lines to stabilization in the Innerwear margins?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hey, Jim. Good morning. We feel good about the margin trajectory for the back half. We've been \u2013 just as a reminder, we've been calling for an improvement in margin expansion in the back half all year long, and that includes Innerwear. And just as a reminder, a few things are playing out in the back half that are very helpful. First off, as we talked about, we've got pricing benefit late in the year, and that's in addition to the seasonal plans that we already have got in motion for the third quarter. So, there will be less raw material impact, and as you know, the raw material has been impacting our Innerwear business particularly through the year.","We'll have the organic growth that we've discussed. And then, just as a reminder, if you think about last year in the fourth quarter in particular, we called out the fact that we had ramped up our marketing spend in that quarter. And so, on a year-over-year basis, that headwind goes away. The distribution inefficiencies that we had in the fourth quarter of last year that we talked about also go away on a year-over-year basis. And then, we had some mix impact last year in the back half. So, we feel very good about where we are as it relates to margin expansion both in Innerwear and in the total business. And I'll just point out that we've got building synergies, our International margins have been improving and Champion's doing great, as Gerald just mentioned. So, we feel good about where we are.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Barry. A follow-up on that. In your prepared comments, you spoke about pricing visibility into 2019. Can you speak in more detail on that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Jim, this is Gerald. From the standpoint of visibility, we're certainly out now communicating our planned price increases for 2019. We said there would be some in 2018 that we have in place, but the majority of the price increases were actually in 2019, as those are more the replenishable programs and we tend to work around the retailers' fiscal years. This is really inflation-driven increases that are across input costs. And as we go out and communicate those, our retailers are really seeing it come through their supply chains as well. So, there's not a surprise when we discuss these price increases with them, and we feel we're well down the path of getting those communicated, in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Hey, thanks for all the information. Wanted to ask a follow-up on Champion. Actually, I want to make a statement. You can respond to it or not. And then, I have a question. It's surprising that given the global kind of momentum and strength behind the parent Champion brand at this current moment that it's the time when Target would choose to kind of walk away from that growing halo around it and move in another direction.","But that being said, is it an opportunity to rethink how you're managing the overall Champion brand? Maybe it doesn't make sense given its kind of global renaissance to have a sub-brand at a value price point or maybe it does make sense. So, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the strategy for the broader Champion brand to get to $2 billion from a brand standpoint, product standpoint, and then talent too. Are you hiring talent to build that division out? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. And just to reinforce first, the C9 business does run through 2019 and the contract ends in early 2020. But from the standpoint of how we're managing the brand, we're definitely managing the brand as a global brand now, and that was an important part of reuniting the brand. And with that came the ability to merge our global product lines and lever the strength of all of those across the world. And we are elevating the brand from that standpoint and we're driving our brand position both from the standpoint of communicating with the consumer, but importantly, we're using our own retail stores in a number of locations to drive the business further.","And we're seeing all of that come together and drive our equities of the brand even stronger, particularly among the younger consumer, which is a fantastic thing to see as a whole group of consumers discovering a brand for the first time. And we're seeing it play out in our L.A. store, for example, our La Brea store. We've had fantastic success and we're looking to open three more stores this year as we roll that out across New York, Chicago and Boston. We've seen the same in Europe, as we pushed the brand up out of what's been typically an Italy base up into Northern Europe. We've expanded both wholesale with some of the key retailers there, as well as we've opened stores.","They've had extraordinary success, and we opened one in London. We've just opened our second in Amsterdam. So, as we look then across Asia, where we've been more established and running our own retail for some time in Japan, we see the same thing there. We see that it's taking hold now in China. Our early initiatives in China have really been extraordinarily successful, as we've opened some stores with a partner there. And even in Japan, we've gone from a business that offered all genders at one store to where we're experimenting with new formats, including one focused at the female consumer only and it's having extreme success. So, we're very happy and we certainly are elevating the brand and driving it around the world.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Does it potentially make sense after 2019 to kind of let the C9 label go by the wayside and just focus on the parent brand? Is that something you thought about?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, a question that was asked earlier and I didn't \u2013 I failed to answer it at the time is the C9 brand is our brand and we do own it. And through 2019, we are certainly focused on driving that and being very successful in Target \u2013 with Target and the relationship. What we do with it post 2020 is yet to be determined. There is equity in that brand. It is a potential tool that we could use. There's potential upside to the brand. But we do think that in the core brand, given all we've done to reunite it, we have incredible momentum and we're going to drive that hard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. Could you speak to the margins on the C9 business that you'll be exiting, how we can think about flowing that into what we saw at the Analyst Day as far as your margin expectations? And then, is there a point on the horizon more broadly where we could expect to see the margins turn positive for the Activewear segment considering all the top line contribution that's coming from that segment?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, this is Barry. I think those are very good questions, and let me take both of those. On the C9 margin, I think you can appreciate that for competitive and proprietary reasons, as well as frankly the terms of the contract, we can't give specific margins for a program like that. But I can also fully respect and appreciate why you'd want to know. So, let me give you a few thoughts to help frame that. First off, I think it's important to note that that business for us is essentially 100% sourced. So, you should expect no deleveraging because it's all sourced. The second thing is let me help you think about the operating margins of our U.S. business for Champion, C9 and then the core U.S. Champion business that's growing so fast.","On operating margin basis, they're essentially the same currently. Importantly though, what we're seeing \u2013 and this goes to the last part of your question, we are seeing a rapid expansion in that core Champion margin as we scale that business. In fact, in the most recent quarter, the gross margins in the core Champion business expanded several hundred basis points year-over-year, and the operating margins were up well over 1,000 basis points year-on-year. So, we're continuing to see the core U.S. Champion margins continue to expand as we scale the business. We got a great outlook on it and we feel really good about the leverage opportunity that's inherent in that business. And frankly, by the way, that concept is playing out around the world in our global Champion growth.","Now, the other part of your question was how does it play into the Investor Day scenarios we talked about. Well, Gerald already talked to you about the $2 billion Champion goal. So, let me speak to the scenarios that we laid out at the end of the Investor Day. First off, nothing's changed regarding our views related to the goals we laid out in the Investor Day or frankly the conservative scenarios that I presented. You'll recall, at the Investor Day, the team presented all those growth strategies, and we also presented the conservative scenarios of what was the business capable of driving for profit and cash flow with just 1% organic CAGR. We separated those two from \u2013 the scenarios from the strategies.","And as you will probably recall, we've been continuing to see the Champion business really grow, and as it specifically relates to the conservative scenarios, C9 was excluded from those scenarios. At the time, we had been talking to you about the fact that that business was mature and we had seen some headwinds there. And frankly, at the time of the Investor Day, the renewal was still pending. So, we specifically excluded it from our CAGRs and the 1% scenario. Said differently, frankly, if the contract had been renewed, we would have significantly exceeded those goals. So, we feel good about where we are and nothing's changed as it relates to those scenarios.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Chethan Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. So, your gross margin guidance for the full-year implies a better year-over-year trend in the back half, which is consistent with how you framed it throughout the year, but still is a pretty big change in trend versus the first half. And I think you've talked about acquisition synergies, the easings of some transitory costs, and improvement in pricing and inflation, and some operating leverage as tailwinds. But is there a way to maybe give a little more detail on the magnitude of each of the factors, just so we can understand what are kind of the larger swing factors that drive that outlook?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. I think you hit on several of them. I'd remind you the raw material inflation was $11 million year-on-year in the second quarter. It was more than that in the first quarter. The pricing benefit is ramping through the back half. And so, as we move through the second half, we see that headwind essentially go away. We have considerably more organic growth in the back half, thanks to the trajectory we see the business is on, and that provides significant leverage.","And I'd suggest that if you just work through the organic growth that's implied in the guidance, you'll find a fair amount of improvement in gross margin there. And then, you're absolutely right. The synergies and our Booster efforts are playing out across the P&L, but certainly help the gross margin considerably. And then in addition, our International margins continue to expand. And so, that part of our business is one that we see, both in the back half as well as moving through the next few years, as continuing to drive margin improvement. So, we feel very good about the gross margin as we move through the back half.","Chethan Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then, just one quick follow-up on back-to-school, just how are you thinking about that time period? It sounds like, from the prepared remarks, you have some pretty good alignment with key retailers and you're obviously lapping a pretty easy comparison. But just any context there would be helpful.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. From the standpoint of back-to-school, we're right in the middle of it right now. In fact, some of the biggest ads of the season, if you follow them, dropped last week for the key mass customers. So, we feel we're well positioned for that, and we'll see how it plays out over the next few weeks. And as you know, it's an extended period. Back-to-school starts now, back-to-college a little longer, but we feel we're well prepared.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple questions on the C9. I guess, Gerald, just for some history maybe, is it possible to tell us what year and maybe what revenue base the C9 business peaked at, because it sounds like it's been in decline for a little bit? And then, maybe over the last 12 months, what has the top line trend in that business looked like, because again, it seems like that business is declining while the core U.S. business is doing really well?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Frankly, Ike, we're limited on what we can share based on our agreement. I can tell you that the business has been in place since 2004 and has grown nicely for many years. It has been mature the last few years, and I think that's where I'll leave it at this point.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, based on how you're talking about the business will continue through January, I think, 2020 I think you said or 2019. So, we're okay for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. But when we get into fiscal 2020, should we essentially model that year assuming there is roughly a 5-point headwind to the total company top line? Or \u2013 I'm just trying to understand how it should be \u2013 how the decline should layer in or when exactly we should expect that in our multi-year models.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I think if you look at the size of the business with the momentum in the balance of the global Champion business, you should see that that is offset by that period of time.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","And Ike, I just want to note that you mentioned when it goes through, it goes through January 2020, and so that's where you ought to be thinking about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. In the wake of the C9 announcement, what can you say to help us build confidence that Target and other retailers wouldn't also look to more aggressively extend their private label programs to Innerwear potentially disrupting Hanes there? Or said it differently, because I know you can't control what other companies do, can you dig into what gives you confidence in your competitive moat?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","First of all, from the standpoint of that relationship, we have a strong relationship with Target and have so for many years. We've got an ongoing business that, in the Innerwear side of the business, is doing very well, and we anticipate and expect that longstanding partnership to continue as we drive mutual growth.","From the standpoint of what gives me confidence, it's in the strength of the brands, the things that we've consistently talked about is brands do matter in our core categories. And as we looked \u2013 at Investor Day, we looked at 2013 and we looked at 2017. And in all cases, for example, in a category like Basics, the branding percentage was in the 80% to 90% in 2013. It was the same in 2017. Consumers do care about brands, young and old, and what we focus on is reinforcing the equity of our brands through innovation and brand investment to continue to maintain that consumer loyalty.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much. Just to follow up on Champion, can you maybe describe to us what percentage of the business right now is in the Activewear segment and what percent is in the International? And as we see the C9 business, when we get to January 2020 change, how we could see the growth in both of those segments for Champion change?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Jay, we don't generally break out the specifics of the business. But I think if you work through the disclosures that we made at the Investor Day, you'll have a good sense of what we've been seeing from Champion in terms of the sizing of it. And in particular, I think the important thing to call out here is the growth that we are seeing is coming across the globe outside of the mass business. If you look at our growth in the quarter, we saw very strong growth in Europe out of Champion, we saw very strong growth out of Champion in Asia, and outside of mass in the U.S., it's just growing over 70%. It's just amazing what we're experiencing here. So, without parsing it much more than we did at the Investor Day, I would just point you to the trajectory we're seeing is phenomenal.","Jay Sole - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And maybe to follow up on that, Gerald, you said that 2019 for Champion and mass is not going to be different from 2018. Can you just maybe give us some more color on that? Because presumably Target will want to have kind of a smooth transition from C9 to whatever they're going to do next. So, is it that the business is going to operate as usual, but sales might be down a little bit as that transition happens? Or do you still expect the sales to be at that same kind of $380 million level that they are this year into next year?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","First of all, the bookings for 2019 are still underway. So, from what's \u2013 what we expect is that we won't see a material difference. We haven't finalized those bookings. So, we'll see how that plays out. But from what we know, the contract runs through January of 2020, and we intend to be providing that program through 2019. And at this point in time, we just \u2013 we do not expect a material difference in the business to what we see this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thanks and thanks for all the color. Just to clarify or contextualize, did you say how much Champion sales are excluding mass or can you? And then, just your point about the current margin expansion is encouraging. Is it surprising that the core Champion business margins were the same as that sourced C9 business just given the benefits we know you have from the manufacturing model? Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","We really don't break it out much more, but we'll consider that for future disclosure. As it relates to the margins, I think what you're seeing there is an inflection in the core Champion margins, and it's been growing for some time, but really now hitting a major amount of scale benefit. And that's one of the reasons \u2013 you point out the internalization of that line. That's one of the reasons we expect that margin to continue to move higher as we see incremental benefit from both the scale of just the organic growth of the line, but also the internal production. So, we feel very good about the margin opportunity on Champion. We are seeing it be favorable to our mix this year, and over the next couple of years, I expect that to continue to play out in a very meaningful way.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Instinet","Okay, great. And then, just one follow-up, if I can. Can you just \u2013 on the cash flow, the operating cash flow line, can you talk through the drivers there around the comfort in hitting your numbers just given \u2013 I think it looks like we're about $100 million behind last year at this point? So, if you can just help understand the drivers there. Thanks.","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Maybe I'd start with, just as a reminder, for our full-year cash flow guidance, it's pretty simple straightforward view. You take our GAAP net income and you add back D&A and stock comp and you kind of are there. Now, having said that, for the second half is what I think you're most focused on, let me start by noting we're ahead of plan for cash flow through the first half. Working capital has been less of a use than we planned for the first half. So, I'd start with that guidance and I would look at our GAAP net income for the second half, and then of course add back the D&A and the stock comp.","Then, I'd encourage you to look at our working capital performance that typically occurs in the second half. As you would appreciate, we're at the seasonal peak for inventory, and that will come down naturally and be a significant generator of cash as we move through the year. Accounts receivable is typically a source in the back half as well, and we certainly expect that again. And frankly, if we just simply repeated last year's second half working capital improvement, not even including the benefit we got from tax reform, we would easily achieve the cash flow guidance that we've put out there. So, we feel good about where we are through the first half and we feel very confident in the guidance we've given for the full-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. If we could go back to the product cost discussion, I know we've already talked about some of the pricing actions you are thinking about. But how much control do you have in offsetting some of these costs through efficiencies in your supply chain in the short-term?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we certainly constantly work on supply chain efficiencies and certainly a part of Project Booster is exactly that project. But our philosophy has always been over time that on inflation, you price for inflation over time. And so, we have done things in the interim to offset some of the costs. But as the inflation builds, we're focused on implementing the prices to recover that inflation.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And as an unrelated question, just with your online business, it seems like you saw some good growth again this quarter. Can you just walk us through any changes you are seeing in how that business is growing, whether it's at your own website or at the pure plays or your retail partners, and where are you seeing the most success and will be seeing any new initiatives in the second half to support the online business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, first of all, I'd say yes, it did grow well, and thanks for calling that out. We're continuing to see it grow generally across the various channels. The biggest change for me would be on a global basis is that we're seeing the traction online build in our International businesses too. It was a little later start there, but we are seeing that build and \u2013 even and across the global pure players. So, it gives us confidence that our strategies are continuing to gain momentum on an International basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First, on the product cost side, just a follow-up. Can you talk about I guess what's driving the inflation, how much does cotton costs matter and how are things looking for next year?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, let me just give you a broad \u2013 let me shape it broadly, and I'll let Barry answer the specific cotton question we always get. But what I want to say first is we're no longer a cotton-dependent company as many people often think we are. And this is not just a cotton question. This is general inflation that comes with a strong economy and the pressure on input costs, and you see it coming across oil, you see it coming across packaging materials and you see it coming across cotton. This is natural inflation. And so, it will touch all the products. That's why our retailers are seeing it come through their own supply chains as well. And so, we are pricing to offset that. From the standpoint of what percent cotton represents of our total, Barry, it's fairly small, isn't it now?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, it is. It's kind of a mid single-digit kind of rate in terms of total. That said, I would just echo the point, inflation is coming across a number of inputs. It's really essentially in line with our expectations. All year, we've been kind of calling for about $35 million of net impact net of pricing, and we continue to see that play just as we've been projecting. And the important thing here I think is that we have good visibility on the pricing line to offset that with the strength of our brands.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Barry, can you quantify the acquisition synergies that are embedded in the guidance for the back half of the year?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. In terms of \u2013 in the third quarter, it's about $55 million, and in the fourth quarter, it is \u2013 of course, we have Alternative Apparel...","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, synergies, not contribution (48:55).","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Oh, synergies. Oh. In terms of synergies, I would say we don't generally break out the specifics. But I would tell you that the synergies are actually ramping. That's one of the things that came in better in the second quarter as compared to our guidance. We noted that we had a couple of elements in the second quarter that were more of a headwind in terms of the guide, but synergy is actually building. We have, I would say, as it relates to the first half several million dollars of upside on a run rate basis, and that's particularly because the International side is seeing significant uptake as it relates to \u2013 and that's both on the gross margin and the SG&A line.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. Can you talk to the consumer reception to the Hanes brand on Amazon and how you feel about the product placement there and just the overall competitive environment on Amazon?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Look, yeah, we feel great about the Amazon relationship. We were one of the early partners with Amazon and have built a nice business there. It is a business that we continue to work on to ensure that our brands pop up first and that it is more competitive than it once was, but we're very focused on continuing to win that buy box and it really is about \u2013 then about marketing. Just like you do in any channel, you have to maintain that presence and invest appropriately, and that's where we're focused.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Organic revenues were down low single-digits in 1H 2017, but then they meaningfully inflected up to low single-digits in 2H 2017. How should we think about the implied organic revenue growth for 2H 2018 as we consider the two-year stack basis?","Barry A. Hytinen - Hanesbrands, Inc.","If you think about it on the prior year, part of that was on the Innerwear, and that was really related to what was going on in the prior year before that in terms of the inventory destocking that the company incurred. So, I think the way you ought to think about this year's organic is a couple of factors. One, Champion is growing really, really well across the globe and continues to be quite additive to the business. Our Basics business is seeing good trends and is improving.","Gerald spoke to the men's and women's underwear growth that we were seeing that actually came in better than we were expecting as the Comfort Flex Fit is driving significant upside on men's. And I would say that our sports apparel business was also ramping better than probably previously expected. So, that's \u2013 those are some factors that I would say. And just generally speaking, the trends in our International business are modestly better than what we were expecting earlier in the year. And so, I would be looking at those factors and recognize that we have a very strong visibility on the Champion side since it's mostly a seasonal commit business.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, very helpful. Thank you. And then, I wanted to follow up on the C9 revenue guide for FY 2019. Just curious to understand if there are minimum revenue contract thresholds. Just curious to reconcile since I think the FAQ this morning calls out that C9 is a seasonal commitment business from a sourcing standpoint. And then, your Target Innerwear business I think was $400 million last year. Maybe you can parse out how that relationship is different and or more long-term compared to the C9 business.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start with the first part of your question. From the standpoint of a guide, what I would say is it is a seasonal commit business. So, the commitments have not been finalized for 2019. So, what we give you at this point is an expectation based on the best information we know at this time, and we do feel like we're well positioned to not see meaningful change from 2018 to 2019. But that will only be confirmed as we go through the bookings for the 2019 period.","We certainly have great lines prepared and we're looking forward to driving that business very strongly with Target as we go through that 2019 period of time. The Innerwear business is built on \u2013 it is a replenishable business. It's built on a replenishment basis in our national brands. It runs with all our businesses as a replenishable business. It's not a contract business. But we feel very good about where our brand shares are and where our performance is within all of our customers, including in particular our key mass customers. So, we feel good about those businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Thomas with Gabelli. Your line is now open.","Doug Thomas - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Gerald, I guess my first comment is I guess \u2013 I just feel like Target must be really out of touch with maybe their core consumers even who \u2013 given the success you guys are having in Champion, this is not the \u2013 this is the time in my view and I guess a lot of other people's view to redouble their commitment to Champion. But that notwithstanding, my question is can you talk about \u2013 you talked about sort of the \u2013 as Activewear and Comfort are coming together, you're relaunching the shapewear business, the shapewear line. Can you talk about what went into the relaunch and what your expectations are long-term? And I guess looking back at the first wave we saw of this before, I'm not \u2013 I don't want to think it was a fad necessarily, but what do you do to try to make this a really sort of long-term growth business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, Doug, let me say first thank you for your comments on the strength of Champion, and we too believe it's got tremendous momentum and feel really good about its momentum going forward toward that 2022 goal of $2 billion. From the shapewear question, it's interesting. You have a lot of insight on the business. The shapewear products, what we've done with these cooling items \u2013 and it's very similar to what we saw across our Basics business, particularly millennial consumers prefer products that perform in some way and they're more familiar with some of the Activewear type products that do something for you.","So, in the case of shapewear, shapewear has traditionally been a very constricting product, can be very warm, and so we have adopted some of the same technology from a cooling yarn standpoint to make the product cooler when it's worn. And that brings an aspect to the business it's been lacking and one that we know has been a consumer \u2013 has made consumers unhappy. So, we feel like along with resetting our programs in Q3, that upgrading it with some of these innovations gives the consumer a reason to come back to the business and purchase again.","Doug Thomas - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Can you create \u2013 can HanesBrands create an aspirational line in that segment of apparel?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we think...","Doug Thomas - GAMCO Investors, Inc.","Or how do you \u2013 yeah.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","We do think we can, because what we try to do with all of our segments is understand the consumer wants and deliver those to them \u2013 or consumer needs in particular. And we know this is one of them. Along with the strength of our Maidenform brand, it's a pretty compelling offering. Now, we have to get it placed, we have to do our job to attract the consumer to it. But we do believe that we're making a compelling offer to a consumer that hasn't bought in a while. And this is a less frequent purchase than some of our other Innerwear categories. So, bringing them back and making that purchase with something new is a pretty important step.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time.

Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. Hanesbrands delivered strong results for the first quarter.","Revenue increased 13% compared to last year. Earnings per share increased 12%. Cash flow from operations improved by more than $260 million, and we returned over $350 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Overall, our results were right in line with our plan. Recall that when we set our guidance for the year, we took a more conservative view than most with respect to the impact from the various headwinds within the U.S. retail market, including door closings and tighter inventory management.","And the year is unfolding just as we expected, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full-year guidance. Over the years, we've talked in detail about the various ways in our multi-faceted business model can drive strong shareholder returns. And today, we announced Project Booster, which is an initiative designed to further optimize our business model and extract additional returns for our shareholders.","Putting Booster in context, if you look back over the past decade, we've refined and strengthened our business model by implementing various strategies based on the underlying premise of Sell More, Spend Less and Generate Cash. These strategies include the globalization of our supply chain, our revenue and margin enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, and the implementation of a disciplined acquisition and capital allocation strategy. These strategies have been extremely successful, driving strong financial results and creating a powerful, global, commercial and supply chain footprint.","That said, you should really think of the past decade as the construction phase, where we built the engine of our business model. Now it's time to fine tune the model to extract its full revenue and cash flow potential. And this is exactly what Project Booster is designed to do.","With Booster, we plan to leverage our global scale and rebalance our operations to remove approximately $150 million of annual cost from our business. We expect to annually reinvest roughly $50 million of these savings as well as reallocate resources to deliver more consistent organic growth of 1% to 2%.","And we plan to drive improvements in working capital, which when combined with the net cost savings is expected to generate an incremental $300 million of annual cash flow from operations. We launched the project late in the first quarter, and we expect to deliver its full benefits by the end of 2019.","Touching briefly on the growth investments and cost-saving initiatives within Project Booster. In terms of our growth investments, we plan to further accelerate development of our omni-channel capabilities, including online in the U.S. as well as our retail and online operations in our international markets. We're planning to increase our investment in our global portfolio of leading brands, including brand building and marketing support. And we plan to further invest in the expansion of our Champion brand globally.","With respect to our cost reduction efforts, these will be driven by two initiatives. The first is to reduce overhead, including head count to better match resources with opportunities as well as to reflect trends on a market-by-market basis. The second initiative is to further lower cost with our supply chain, which will come on top of the expected synergies from our current acquisitions.","Some examples include generating procurement and product development efficiencies, leveraging global fabric platforms, redesigning our distribution network to more efficiently ship online orders and further optimizing our global textile and selling operations.","So, in summary, we had a strong first quarter. The year is unfolding just as we expected, and we feel good about our outlook for the full year. Looking forward over the next several years, as we realize synergies from our prior acquisitions and unlock our potential through Project Booster, we believe we're very well positioned to deliver more consistent levels of organic growth, higher levels of sustainable profitability and over $1 billion of annual cash flow from operations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. Given my recent decision to retire by the end of the year, let me reflect on the past few years as a way to help frame the company's future as we launch Project Booster.","Over the past five years, the implementation of our Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy and all its variations has significantly transformed our business. Over this time, we've added approximately $1.6 billion of revenue. We've expanded our global footprint with nearly a third of our sales now coming from our international businesses. We've more than doubled our operating profit, while expanding margins by over 500 basis points. We've completed $2.3 billion of acquisitions, and we've returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","The evolution of our business model has clearly driven strong results over the past five years. With Project Booster, we're entering the next phase of our evolution, which is where we fully leverage our large global footprint and unlock the full revenue and cash flow potential of our business model. And we believe this positions us for continued growth over the next five years.","In terms of the impact and cadence from Booster; the project, which began late in the first quarter, is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017. We incurred approximately $7 million of cost in the first quarter or about $0.02 a share primarily from head count-related actions. We expect an equivalent level of expense in Q2, which is factored into our current guidance. The Booster-related costs are reflected in our adjusted results. So, to be clear, these costs are not part of our acquisition and integration-related charges. The savings from these actions, which are expected to fully offset the first half costs, should flow through in the third and fourth quarters.","Looking forward, gross cost savings, working capital improvements as well as growth-related investments in Project Booster are expected to build over the next two years reaching on an annual basis $100 million of net cost savings and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019.","I want to emphasize that the benefits from Booster are on top of our annual $30 million to $40 million of supply chain efficiency gains and on top of the remaining synergies from our prior acquisitions. And as Gerald noted, when you combine the remaining synergies from our existing acquisitions, with the expected benefits from Project Booster, we are very well positioned to exit 2019 at a run rate of more than $1 billion a year in cash flow from operations.","Now let me walk you through some of the specifics for the quarter. We're off to a strong start to the year as our results were in line with our expectations and our guidance. Sales increased 13% over last year, driven by roughly $210 million of acquisition contributions.","With respect to organic sales, was 4% decline versus last year, was in line with our expectations and showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Organic growth in Activewear, Online, Asia and the Americas was offset by expected declines in Innerwear as well as our new Other segment, which consists of our businesses that are being managed for cash.","Touching briefly on organic sales. There were a number of encouraging signs within the quarter that reinforced our confidence for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses. Online sales in the U.S. across all channels grew at a double-digit rate. Our largest business, men's underwear, grew low single-digits as order patterns normalized with a large mass retailer.","Our Activewear segment returned to organic growth, while our Asia business continue to grow at double-digit rates. And as we look through the second half, simply wrapping our higher growth acquisitions and last year's exit from our legacy catalog business is expected to add over 150 basis points to organic growth.","Looking at our segments. Activewear sales increased 3% over last year, driven by low single-digit organic growth and a modest contribution from last year's acquisition of GTM. Champion sales in the U.S. were up double-digits, as we continued to benefit from our refreshed product offering and increased space within the mass channel. This more than offset the decline in our Hanes Activewear business. Operating margin of 10.2% was essentially flat relative to last year.","Switching to our International segment. Sales growth was driven by the contributions from last year's acquisitions, while organic sales on a constant currency basis were essentially flat in the quarter. Operating margin of 10.6% increased 170 basis points over last year driven primarily by synergies from Hanes Europe.","Turning to our Innerwear segment. Sales decreased roughly 6% over last year in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 20.3% was essentially flat versus last year. In basics, the strength in our men's underwear business was more than offset by declines in other product categories due to challenging traffic and cautious inventory management by retailers.","With respect to intimates, the entire year-over-year decline was driven by a single retailer who began its planned door closings during the quarter. We felt good about our outlook for the second half as our shelf space is stabilizing, and we're seeing traction with our new Maidenform offerings, which are being rolled out across multiple channels throughout the year.","Looking at our overall results, gross margin improved 230 basis points over last year to 40.2%, driven by acquisition-related mix as well as efficiency gains within our supply chain. Operating margin of 11.6% declined 50 basis points over last year, due entirely to the roughly $7 million of costs related to Project Booster.","Core operating margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by $5 million of acquisition synergies. The tax rate was 6% in the quarter, in line with our full year guidance, while EPS of $0.29 was at the high-end of our guidance range despite the $0.02 per share impact from Booster-related expenses.","With respect to balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Core inventory declined 8%, while cash flow from operations improved $262 million over last year. About half of the cash flow improvement was timing related, while the other half was from structural improvements to working capital. We also invested approximately $300 million during the quarter to repurchase nearly 15 million shares.","Turning to guidance, we reiterated our full year outlook while also providing second quarter guidance. So I'll point you to the press release and our FAQ document for any specifics.","That said, let me touch on a couple of items regarding Q2. First, with respect to sales, our guidance includes approximately $200 million from acquisition contributions, which implies an organic sales decline of roughly 2%, continuing our improving trend to return to organic sales growth in the second half. And second, our guidance includes approximately $8 million of Booster-related expense or about $0.02 a share, which will fall primarily in SG&A.","So, in summary, we're off to a strong start for the year as our results were right in line with our expectations. We grew revenue 13%, we grew earnings per share 12%, we delivered strong improvements in cash flow, and we returned over $350 million to shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. As you can see, we had a strong first quarter. The year is unfolding as we expected, and we feel good about our outlook for the second quarter and the balance of the year.","We saw sequential improvement in organic growth in the first quarter. We're forecasting continued sequential improvement in the second quarter, and we expect to return to organic growth in the second half.","Looking beyond this year, we're very excited about our prospects for continued growth as Project Booster leverages the scale of our global footprint to deliver our full revenue and cash flow potential.","With Booster, we are investing for growth behind our leading brands, our omni-channel initiatives and the global expansion of Champion. We're driving cost out of our business and we're improving all areas of working capital management to deliver higher levels of sustainable cash flow. So, as we look forward over the next several years, we believe we're very well positioned for continued revenue, profit and cash flow growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T. C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Our first question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. So, thank you very much. Very intrigued to hear about Project Booster. Could you help us understand what the building blocks are to get to that $300 million of operating cash flow improvement? Where are the real big moving pieces beyond the cost saving side of the equation?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, as we said, about $100 million of the Project Booster number will come from cost savings. Those cost savings will be both SG&A related, but mostly cost to sales related as we continue to leverage our supply chain. And then $200 million of the $300 million cash flow improvement from Project Booster will then come from working capital improvements, and that's going to come across the board. It'll come through continuing to drive improving inventory turns. It'll come through \u2013 and also as well in improving our accounts payable and accounts receivable management. So, there are lot of elements to it. It's really not one thing, but a whole organizational effort.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. And could I ask about your expectations for return to organic growth in the back half of the year? What are you seeing at point-of-sale to give you comfort in that trajectory?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","What I would say, first of all, Q1 was the quarter that we expected to see the greatest impact from door closings, and that's playing out as expected and it's now behind us. And we expect improvement to continue into Q2 and growth returning in the second half. And we really see that from three things. And the first one is that we're seeing positive signs within our key businesses. Our Activewear segment returned organic growth. We're seeing double-digit growth in our Online sales. Our Asia business continues to grow at double-digit rates and our Latin America business has showed growth in the quarter as well.","Now within Innerwear, while it was down, our men's underwear grew at low single-digit rates and our intimate space outside of door closures stabilized and positioned us for growth. We did see POS to improve through the quarter and build as we moved into the April period. And so, we see that as a positive as well.","As we look to the second half, we pick up the additional benefit to organic growth that our back-to-school business is weighting more heavily to Q3. So that's a tailwind for us as we go toward Q3 in the second half.","And then finally, as Rick noted in his comments, as we turn to the second half, we pick up about 150 basis points of improvement in organic growth by overlapping last year's catalog exit and overlapping the acquisitions of Pacific Brands and Champion Europe. So, with the closings behind us, we're seeing signs of positives trends in our core business as well. And the tailwinds we pick up in the second half, we feel good about our guidance and the trend of our business to move to growth in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with FBR.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. Good evening. Congrats on a good quarter in a really tough environment.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Susan.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And Rick, let me just extend my congratulations, but we'll definitely miss you here, but good luck with everything in the future.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, Susan.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I was wondering if maybe you could give a little bit more color on the women's innerwear. So, was it still negative even excluding the door closings? And then also maybe just some color on the weaker areas there. And then I think you mentioned, the new Maidenform offerings, have those begun to roll out yet, or is that mainly second half? And then also if you could talk about any other space gains in Innerwear, Activewear for the second half? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Specific to Innerwear in total, Innerwear was the category that was down in the first quarter. And as much as my prior comments, we expected Q1 to be the most challenged because it was where the door closings where. And frankly, Innerwear was the business that was most affected by door closings as it has the broadest distribution.","In spite of that, we saw a number of positives. The men's underwear business did grow nicely in the quarter, low single-digits rate. And we actually, across our basics business, we gained share in the quarter as well. Certainly, our FreshIQ is a innovation is driving momentum across those businesses, and we anticipate further introductions of ComfortBlend in the next few weeks with a new fabric platform.","Specific to the intimates business, all of the Q1 decline was tied to a single retailer who is closing doors. So, outside of those closings, we've actually seen our intimate space stabilized and we feel now that we're well positioned as we look to the second half there to drive growth in our intimates business as well. And certainly, we are seeing traction in some of those new Maidenform innovations, and that's an important driver of second half growth as well as we flow out those new initiatives in Maidenform.","So, when you see that, and you add it to the movement of the back-to-school weighting more heavily to the third quarter, as we've seen for some time, our retailers are moving their purchases closer to the event, we think things are building nicely to give us some momentum to return to positive growth in Innerwear in the second half.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. That sounds really positive. And then, are you guys expecting any other space gains in the second half in either Innerwear or Activewear in the U.S.?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, I think from a space standpoint in Innerwear, things are pretty stable at this point in time. And that's a very positive statement as we come out of door closings to be able to say that we've stabilized the space and we're not going to build up on that space and drive growth forward. On the Activewear side, we are seeing some space expansion in certain channels as well look to the second half, so we do have some expansion there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta from C.L. King & Associates.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good evening, everyone. Gerald, you've mentioned a couple of times that you expect organic growth to reaccelerate in the second half. Just to put a finer point on it, do you expect that in Q3 as well as Q4?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","We do expect it to ramp in Q3. It benefits from the certainly, among other things, the carry-on of the back-to-school orders that were last year in Q2. So that's an important driver of that. I also want to point you to the fact that we overlap our exit of our catalog business on the broader basis that would affect our organic growth in the first half of the year.","And then finally, our acquisitions go into that organic base in the back half of the year. And those two acquisitions grow at a mid single-digit rate. So there's a lot of fuel to that that you'll see ramp as it goes in the third quarter. We do expect growth driven by those initiatives also into the fourth quarter. But I would add, we've been cautious in how we planned inventory management by our retailers. And we're not anticipating the traditional holiday builds that we were accustomed to in the past. We think that the retailers will be more cautious in their inventory management in the fourth quarter.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","But even with that caution, organic growth in the third and fourth quarter would be expected?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up question is, as it relates to the omni-channel domestically, and you mentioned that there will be some initiatives and investments there in the coming years. Is that your direct-to-consumer, or is this in support of your wholesale dotcom customers?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","It's all of those things. From the standpoint of our investment, it's investment in people to better service the various accounts, which includes our wholesale brick-and-mortar customers who are developing their online capabilities very quickly. It's servicing the pure plays that are emerging and also driving our own sites. It's also from the standpoint of investing our media more effectively to engage the consumer where they're engaging with our brands and as increasingly in the digital world.","And then finally on an international basis, we have a number of businesses that now have strong omni-channel businesses that are a combination of online businesses and stores. And we certainly intend to keep ramping those as they proven to be very strong growth models in the international markets.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Burns from D.A. Davidson.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good evening. You did call out the timing of shipments for the back-to-school season from 2Q to 3Q. I was wondering if you could quantify that.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I would say, it's probably in the 20 million to 30 million range. It's hard to say at this point, Andrew. We'll give a much better feel for it as we go through the quarter, but that's a general range for you.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks. And I was hoping you could spend a little more time on the $50 million in incremental brand investments, specifically on Champion. What are the top priorities for investments, or largest opportunities you see for the global platform going forward? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Specifically, to Champion, Andrew, we spent the last several years reassembling the Champion brand and building a global footprint and the final piece of that fell in place with the acquisition of Champion Europe. So with that in place, and given our extensive global product line, we see an opportunity now to engage on multiple levels from the standpoint of brand building with advertising, but also continuing to ramp our store development in Europe and build our distribution in our brick-and-mortar retailers here as well. So, we see an opportunity to invest in all elements of the marketing mix and drive that business forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back, follow-up on a prior question about the $300 million of cash flow generation. Rick, you mentioned working capital improvement, but maybe give a little more detail, I guess, we've always looked at as you guys running a fairly tight ship on working capital anyway. So, may be just a little help with how you're thinking about where the inventory improvement in turns comes from in the accounts receivable and payables please?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. I'd be glad to, Mike. So, let's take inventory first. When we began our acquisitions a few years ago, we actually saw our turns begin to decline as we begin to integrate new businesses into our organization. As we've now become better at that, and we've kind of bottomed out kind of that two turns type of a range. What we now see is that we are able to continue to integrate but do so and we returned our turns to a more normal level. So, I would expect to see about a 10th of a turn a year in improvement in turns from that two turns base on average. So that's inventory.","Let's talk about accounts payable. As we become more global and our footprint as we become larger, we have an opportunity to become more effective in the way we negotiate terms, conditions and price with our largest vendors. And so, as we do that, we're seeing our days to pay extend. I think you're seeing there's a lot of people, we're seeing it as well.","On the accounts receivables side, what we're seeing is that as we're able to integrate our international businesses, we're able to make good progress in reducing their DSO. We have a really strong competency in our organization, and we're able to transfer that to our acquired companies and reduce DSOs. So, it's really, like all those three things playing together, it things that we know how to do that we've done in the past and that we expect to be able to continue to do in the future.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. If I could just one put in one follow-up with Gerald. And Gerald, it would seem that you guys have said for a long, long time, it seems very intuitive is that over time sell-in and sell-through should match up in the categories you sell-in. Organic trends have been a little bit negative here for a while, but I do believe that intuition is correct. I'm just wondering as we see these categories move online to places like Amazon and other digital channels, it seems like your categories would be very natural to transition over to those channels.","But it just seems like when we add it all up, the negative organic is like the brick-and-mortar sales are falling faster than e-com channels are picking it up. Do you see that as something that's temporary, or do you see some reason why sell-in and sell-through are not balancing out right now as we go through these closures in brick-and-mortar and it's not being picked up quite fast enough in the e-commerce channel, is that something that can change?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, certainly there's a disruption in the retail channel going on now with a number of door closings and so forth that is taking sales out of the mix as they sell off their inventory. And as that sale then moves longer term to an online player, particularly pure player they tend to turn their inventory at a faster pace. So, it takes some period of time for that inventory turn to actually catch up with the lost distribution.","I think the best indication of our success in capturing that business has seen in something like our basics business and particularly, underwear whereas we saw reordering normalized our sales increased, and we see our share across basics increasing with it. It tells me that as we're growing our business online, we're capturing the share and increasing our share and holding our share in the market. And that's the best indication to me that the business is moving and we're capturing it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, in your analysis of the online environment, there're some categories where you feel you have more opportunities than others. And then, what are some of the key areas of omni-channel investment that's been helped with competitive positioning and influence those categories?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start with the \u2013 from the standpoint of categories, our intimate apparel categories have traditionally been better developed online. And the basics businesses were a little slower to develop online, they were more traditionally consolidated in the mass channel and so forth. They are rapidly developing online.","In all of our categories, we hold the leading shares online and are growing as we shift our business out, we're expanding that share. Certainly our focus has been on aggressively expanding our capabilities from an omni-channel perspective, which means selling online in the U.S. heavily, and we're developing that not only with our own sites, but with our brick-and-mortar retailers and with pure plays. And we see our brick-and-mortar retailers in particular making great strides now online, which gives us great enthusiasm to our ability to continue to grow that business and for them to succeed frankly.","In the international markets, it tends to be a bit more of a balance of owned brand stores and online. And so, we balance our investment across those multiple opportunities. And that is typically a combination of people and also in marketing money investment as we shift to engage the customer where they're buying today.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. Gerald, you mentioned that online retailers have faster turns. Is there a rule of thumb figure that you think about as to the amount of inventory needed to service the same amount of business online versus in a brick-and-mortar environment? Is there any way to put shape around that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Not really. It varies by business, but traditionally I think it's quite simple as they run one warehouse in many cases, or a few warehouses while retailers have a warehouse in multiple stores as well to turn. So you can get a sense of the pace of the turn difference between the two, and I think that's what they're working through. As in any case, some categories turn faster than others.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys. I guess two questions for us. First on the door closures, how much was that impact to sales in 1Q? And maybe talk about what levers do you have in place if there are additional door closures out there?","And then secondly on gross margins, really strong results there. How much of the expansion was the new businesses versus organic improvement? And what kind of gross margin expansion are you implying in the second quarter guide? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I'll handle the door closure, I'll let Rick handle the margin portion of that question. From the standpoint of door closures, while we won't give you the exact numbers, we can tell you that it was a heavy impact on the first quarter, and it was a substantial portion of the sales shortfall in the quarter on organic sales. Rick, you want to handle margins?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, I was actually hopping somebody would ask that. Our margins are really good this quarter. We're up 230 basis points on gross margin, 200 basis points of that came from acquisitions, about 30 basis points came from manufacturing cost savings that dropped down to the bottom line.","When you really look at the operating profit margin for the quarter, we saw the base business, the core business generate 40 basis points, that's 90 basis points of improvement from cost savings and synergies, mostly and then offset by about 50 basis points of Booster expenses. So, a really strong performance in the quarter on margins.","In terms of Q2, if you do the midpoint on our guidance back into that, you find that we're expecting operating margins in second quarter to be down about 150 basis points. That's 100 basis points from the dilution from the short-term dilution from the lower margin acquisitions that we did last year.","The core margins, it should be fairly flattish except for the 50 basis points from Project Booster that will flow through in the quarter. We're kind of expecting flattish margins because we're going to see a little bit of a richer mix towards Activewear this year versus last year in the quarter. And that business has a little bit lower margins.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I think there was a last portion of the question was about future door closures. Certainly from the standpoint of 2017, as we entered the year, we planned a number of known door closures into our guidance. And I would say that while they were heavily in the first quarter, we feel that we capture the bulk of them that will be experienced in 2017. Retailers tend to plan these well in advance. They're complex exercise and. So, we have a good side of what we'll experience in 2017 and feel that's in our guidance and best majority of it is behind us. And so we feel that the like we're well positioned in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Project Booster sounds like a big piece of it is investing in marketing and brand building. Can you talk about what Project Booster implies for how marketing as a percent of sales might change as we look forward into fiscal 2018 and 2019, 2020?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me just say that Project Booster is really about taking the Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash that we've evolved over time to unlock value and unlocking more value. We're basically leveraging the scale that we create over time. And it gives us the opportunity as we reduce cost to use a portion of those savings to increase our marketing and address the market challenges and drive the more consistent organic growth that we've been lacking over time, as well as to improve our working capital management to generate higher levels of sustainable cash flow.","As to what percent of marketing that represents would depend \u2013 our total sales that represents would depend on doing an entire P&L and looking at the top and bottom line. So, I think it's fair to say that we will ramp that investment over time with the clear intent to drive more consistent organic growth.","In fact, Rick, you may want to touch on the cadence sort of how that's spending and savings might roll out.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, I think as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we would expect the Booster expenses and savings in 2017 to pretty well offset each other. Then as we roll into 2018 and 2019, you would expect similar to what we've seen with synergies.","We expect to see the SG&A savings come a little faster than the cost of sales because the cost of sales take a little longer to flow through to the balance sheet and then on to the P&L. So, what that would suggest then is that in terms of cadence, you'll see savings in both 2018 and 2019, though skewed a little bit more to 2019 as our current plan. But you'll see savings and investments throughout that period, and we should hit a run rate net savings of about $100 million by the end of 2019.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then maybe if I could ask one more on Innerwear in the quarter. I know there's many subcategories within Innerwear, but can you give us a broad sense of, within sales, can you break down unit growth versus year-over-year change in ASP?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, we don't normally. We don't generally give that out. And to your point, I mean, they can be somewhat misleading when you look at it in the whole, because the cost of a pair of socks versus say a bra are so dramatically different that it can really skew that price per unit versus volume analysis when you look at it. You really have to look at it on a very detail level to really get meaningful numbers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Two quick ones. So, sorry if I missed it, are the $150 million savings dependent on a certain level of organic sales growth over the next few years? And if so, what sales growth would you need to get that leverage that you mentioned in the FAQs?","And then just, Rick, sorry if I misheard it. But just to confirm, did you say that Q1 gross margins benefited by 200 basis points from acquisitions, but then 2Q should be pressured by lower margin acquisitions. I just want to clarify that and get what you said the expected gross margins for the second quarter should be embedded within your EPS guide? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Let me clarify the other. First, on your question on Booster. No, the savings are not contingent on achieving any level of growth. The nature of where we expect to see the savings is based on our ongoing operations.","And let me clarify what I've said a little earlier. In terms of the operating margins from the first quarter, the operating margins were down 50 basis points primarily due to Booster, but we did see the margins hit by the acquisitions in the quarter. The acquisitions were generally running 7%, 8% operating margins in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we expect to see a similar 100-basis-point hit to margins.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities","Got it. And the gross margin would see a benefit?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Absolutely, yeah. We're continuing to see \u2013 and let me explain why that is. The two acquisitions, Pac Brands and Champion Europe have a very heavy retail element to them, which has a very different dynamic through the P&L. So, much higher gross profit margin, but also much higher SG&A. So you have to look at them together.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hey.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","I guess, my first question I wanted to ask is the timing and impetus behind the cost savings portion of the plan, the Booster plan. Can you talk about why now and what kind of were the key factors that led to the decision to pursue this course of action as the infrastructure and the platform you built oversized for what where businesses or are you identifying incremental opportunities that you didn't see before to create shareholder value through cost savings. Maybe help put a little bit of framework around why this and why now?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. I'd be happy to, Omar. From the standpoint of our strategies, we've consistently evolve the Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy over time. And over the past five years, we've expanded our business dramatically, and we've upgraded our IT infrastructure and further globalized our supply chain and broadened our international reach through acquisitions.","But the one thing we haven't done is deliver consistent organic growth or consistent cash flow. And we really believe that this is important element that we need to deal with. And so, as we view the growing scale that we have, we view it as a next natural step is for us to leverage the scale that we've created over the past five years to further enhance the productivity of our company, to take advantage of the global scale, to reduce our cost, use a portion of it to spend back to drive our business and improve our working capital management to generate higher sustainable cash flow and frankly, address the things that have been missing from the consistency of our performance.","Why now? As we sat down and looked at the potential of what we've built and the needs we had to correct that this seemed the natural time to put this program in motion, and that's what we've done. And we're very excited about the potential of this and what we can really achieve by unleashing the full revenue and cash flow potential of this company.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's really helpful, Gerald. And I wanted to ask one follow-up around the omni-channel initiatives and investments you're going to making there. As you think about potentially the evolving behavioral patterns, when it comes to consumers around underwear and innerwear type purchases, have you thought at all about maybe pursuing something along the lines of subscription model or other creative ways to kind of create the digital social connection with consumers and replace the regular trips that used to happen at retailer now kind of morphing into more digital trips. I'm wondering if you thought about other creative kind of digital opportunities to create that consistency in the business.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, that's one of the great things as we've continued to invest in our capabilities and evolve is that among other things we have our own internal website, people that run that and we have the capability to experiment with all those models. And certainly, other things we do, think about ways to launch those subscription concepts over time. So, we certainly are looking at that. We're certainly working with our brick-and-mortar partners as well to evolve their distribution capability to capture business as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Nancy Hilliker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. This is a Nancy Hilliker on for Ike. I am wondering if you guys could give us a little more color on the trends in the International business, Hanes Europe, what are the challenges in getting that kind of piece of the business back to growth. And in Pac Brands and obviously you've talked a little bit about the potential for Champion. And then also if you could just touch on the appetite for acquisitions, is that dependent on the cost savings or could we see acquisitions sooner than that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start with the International question. Our International businesses are performing well. Our Pacific Brands and Champion Europe acquisitions are doing very well. We're in the early stages of executing their integration plans and they're right on course and frankly, if anything they're exceeding our expectations at this point in time. So, we feel great about their performance in the management teams.","Our Hanes Europe business was a more complicated integration and we're down the path with that. And from a synergy standpoint, we continue to capture synergies and they're well into their double-digit operating margins each and every quarter, which is a vast improvement from where we acquired that business. There certainly have been some headwinds on to the top line on that side. There're some political activities certainly in the western part of Europe, if you will, now between Brexit and the political situation in France. That's creates some short-term interruptions that will get passed and that certainly tempers the top line a bit. While in the southern part of Europe, we see very strong trends. So, I'm very proud of what they're doing, and we believe that those headwinds from the political issues will pass as well.","Let me address, from the acquisition standpoint, absolutely, acquisitions remain a significant part of our strategy. They've created significant value for our shareholders over time. And a perfect example is, you just asked me about some companies that are executing very well and have contributed substantial amount of sales and profit to our company. We followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that was a combination of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. And we'll continue to do that in the future as we believe that's working very well for our shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of William Schultz from Goldman Sachs.","Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Really nice result in Activewear. Good to see that return of growth in the quarter. Can you help maybe dimensionalize the improvement you saw there, Champion U.S., in particular, maybe sort of unpack it between distribution growth, productivity increases in existing accounts would be helpful.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Happy to. As you said, it's great to see Activewear return to growth. And we feel good about it, and that's what we anticipate and it came through as we had planned it in our plan. We did see nice growth in Champion. It was a double-digit rate of growth, and we saw solid growth particularly in the mass channel as we had some space expansion, but we're also seeing positive trends in our department and sports specialty channel as well. In addition, the sports license business performed very well in the quarter. So, we saw good activity in several pieces of the Activewear business that drove our growth.","Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then second question just on cotton. U.S. cotton prices have moved up a bit. Can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about the outlook for pricing and AUC, just broadly across your business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. In terms of cotton, I'll just make a couple of comments. Just remind everybody that cotton costs are less than 6% of our cost to sales now. And so, yes, well that's have an impact. As long as it stays within a normal band of volatility, which it has, it is up a little bit, but it's not abnormal based on its historical patterns. As long as it stays in those bands, we're fine. We're locked in through the end of this year on our cotton costs. And so, we have good visibility to that. And we generally try to be nine to 12 months ahead in terms of our locking in our cotton.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen & Co.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Afternoon, I should say.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Can you just talk about pre-tax charges related to the acquisitions are down pretty significantly year-over-year this year. Where you think this will trend in coming years? Obviously, this could be another benefit to cash flow if they continue to come down.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Our guidance for the year hasn't changed, it's $80 million to $90 million of charges this year. As you pointed out, that's a significant drop from last year. We expect to see again, assuming no new acquisitions, which I wouldn't, but assuming that, you should see another pretty substantial drop next year, and then we shouldn't \u2013 then all","XA (50:53) charges related to current existing acquisitions should be finished by the end of 2019.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up on synergies from all the acquisitions that have done, they've been increasing into this year, just wondering where we are in the realization cycle of all these synergies? How much is left? What you think might fall into 2018 and 2019 from all the acquisitions?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Right now, our best estimate is that total synergies from our acquisitions should reach $220 million. We have recognized $125 million of those so far through the end of Q1, which would leave us with $95 million. We recognized $5 million this year in the first quarter, so we've given guidance of $15 million for the full year. So, $10 million more this year and then the remaining $85 million would come in 2018 and 2019 on a declining scale between those two years.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question for today comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Rick, you had mentioned that the gross margin in the second quarter would be more flattish than this quarter where you saw so much improvement...?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I'm sorry, I meant operating profit margin would be more flattish. Core operating margin would be flattish in Q2.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, on the gross margin side, are you expecting to see a similar improvement to what we saw this quarter?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I think you're going to continue to see improvement. I don't want to start giving guidance on gross profit margin, but we'll continue to see improvement. It's the same dynamic that you saw in the first quarter that you should see in the second quarter, perhaps not necessarily on the same scale, but should see strong improvements year-over-year.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, yeah. (52:49) first quarter how sustainable is that. It sounded like the pieces that made it up, the mix and while that will move around a little bit, but that it was a sustainable type of rate in Q1.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, it was very strong, but we expect \u2013 what we said historically is that, we do expect \u2013 even when we wrap the acquisitions in the beginning of the third quarter, we still expect to see incremental gross margin improvement quarter-after-quarter or year-over-year, improvement in each quarter.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And have you given expectation for cash taxes this year?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, I'll tell you, we don't generally give guidance on that. Historically, our cash taxes have been half or less of our estimated tax rate. That varies from year-to-year though, Carla. It's not generally a big driver of cash flow one way or the other.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the conference over to T.C. Robillard, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","T.C. Robillard - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the HanesBrands' quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We're pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the fourth quarter of 2015. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release and the replay of the call can be found in the Investors section of our hanes.com website.","On the call today, we may make forward-looking statements, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.","The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made. Unless otherwise noted, today's references to our consolidated financial results as well as our 2016 guidance exclude all one-time charges and expenses. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP, can be found in today's press release.","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer; Gerald Evans, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. For today's call, Rich will focus on a few big picture themes, Gerald will focus on key highlights within our business operations, and Rick will focus on certain financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, T.C. 2015 was another record year for Hanesbrands. We grew revenue 8%, operating profit 13%, and earnings per share 17%, once again, magnifying our growth rates as you walk down the P&L and we intend to do it again in 2016. While these are great results, make no mistake, they're not up to the high standards to which we hold ourselves at Hanesbrands. We did not fully deliver on our Q4 commitments. While Q4 was impacted by the well-publicized retail traffic declines, frankly, we struggled a bit on the sales line all last year. So, it's time to refine our approach and regain our sales momentum. We have a variety of focused initiatives designed to reenergize sales. These initiatives, which Gerald will highlight, give us confidence in our ability to firmly deliver our 2016 revenue target.","We also expect another year of double-digit earnings growth, growing EPS 11% to 15%. Importantly, we can achieve the low end of this range, just with our expected acquisition synergies, our historical level of SG&A leverage and the projected contribution from share repurchases.","In terms of cash flow, we have several action plans in place that put us on track to generate up to $850 million this year, which would be the highest level in our history. To put this in perspective, this is the amount of cumulative cash flow we generated in the first three years as a public company. Turning to acquisitions, both DBA, now renamed Hanes Europe, and Knights Apparel continue to perform extremely well.","Operating results were above plan, the integrations are progressing on schedule, and we are on target to deliver $40 million in synergies this year. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have turned our attention to 2016 acquisitions. A number of variables obviously need to fall into place, but with the integration of Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe now in full swing, we have the bandwidth to take on additional acquisitions.","So, in closing, we are refocusing on driving our top-line and we are well positioned for another year of double-digit EPS growth, with upside provided by potential future acquisitions.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Rich. We have a lot of things working very well in our business, such as our innovations, our supply chain efficiencies, our margin enhancement strategies, and our acquisitions. And this is evidenced by three consecutive years of double-digit growth in both operating profit and earnings per share.","However, the fourth quarter did not turn out as we had expected. Retail traffic declined at high single-digit rates in November and the first three weeks of December driven by one of the warmest holidays on record. The prolonged traffic decline weighed on point-of-sale trends, even in our Innerwear products as there were fewer people in the stores. This caused retailers to pull back on their orders, which in turn impacted our shipments for the quarter. The impact was across all channels, and relative to our expectations, it was split between our Innerwear and Activewear segments. Relative to last year, the lion's share of the decline was in Activewear as Innerwear sales were down only 2% in the quarter.","As retail traffic improved in the last two weeks of December and into January, so did our point-of-sale trends. Looking at January, our basics' POS is up low single-digits month-to-date, while Champion in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels is up low double-digits. While weather affected Q4 and our POS is rebounding from that, our core business in 2015 was essentially flat for the year. And I'm not at all satisfied with that level of performance. So, we're being proactive by putting in place several focused initiatives to drive improved revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. And this is something I am committed to deliver.","Let me take you through why I'm so confident that we can achieve our sales guidance for 2016, which calls for growth of 1% on the low end of the range and 3% on the high end. To reach the low end of our range, we only need about $70 million of incremental sales, which we should be able to hit with the $50 million from acquisition contributions and the absence of last year's $50 million to $60 million of Innerwear headwinds from the retail inventory destocking and our Intimates brand transition, partially offset by approximately $40 million in currency headwinds.","From there, the execution of our various sales initiatives, as well as a more normalized Q4 represents another $100 million to $150 million in revenue opportunity that could put us at or above the high end of our range. There is four specific sales initiatives that I have the organization focused on delivering. One, continue to drive Innovate-to-Elevate by expanding space of our successful innovation platforms such as X-Temp. Two, apply Innovate-to-Elevate to our core products by driving innovation and making the right investments to deliver better volume growth. Three, continue to accelerate growth online and build upon our leading market share positions across all of our brands. And four, deliver product enhancements and Champion across all channels.","With my focus on reenergizing sales growth, I want to emphasize that these efforts and investments will still come with the same focus on profitability and cash flow generation. And you can see that in our guidance which calls for roughly 100 basis points of operating margin expansion driven by our acquisition synergies, as well as our continued focus on effectively managing our SG&A.","We also intend to deliver record level of cash flow this year. Rick will walk you through the various drivers of our cash flow, but let me talk to the largest contributor, inventory. To bring our inventory level down in a cost-efficient manner, we will need to make small adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, which we will do by taking a little time out internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work-in-process.","So in closing, our brand is strong. Our innovation is working. We're expanding our margins and we're generating significant synergies from acquisitions. Add to this the heavy focus I have on executing our sales initiatives and I feel really good about our ability to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gerald. Last quarter, I spoke about how we create strong shareholder returns through the combination of our core business strategies, our acquisition strategies and our cash deployment strategies. This is the underlying formula that drives the magnification of our growth rate from sales to operating profit and again to earnings per share. 2015 was the third year in a row we've delivered on magnifying our growth rate down to P&L. And we believe we're well-positioned do it again in 2016. Before I turn to the results, I'd like to point everyone to our FAQ document, which provides additional details on our 2015 results, as well as our 2016 guidance.","For 2015, the 8% increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions, as our core business ended flat with the sales decline in Q4. Operating profit increased 13% or nearly a $100 million due to the addition of roughly $50 million from acquisitions, and a 150-basis-point increase in our core operating margin as we benefited from efficiency gains in our supply chain, synergies from acquisitions and ongoing cost controls.","Earnings per share grew 17% driven by the growth in operating profit, a slightly lower tax rate and the contribution from share repurchases. And cash flow from operations was $227 million. The weaker than expected cash flow was the result of an inventory buildup due to the sales shortfall coming very late in the year. With no markdown risk and specific action plans to reduce inventory, we believe the impact is temporary.","Turning to our 2016 guidance, we expect full year sales to be $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which represents a 1% to 3% increase over last year. And as Gerald highlighted, we have a variety of focused initiatives that give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our revenue target. We expect operating profit to be $920 million to $950 million, which implies a 90-basis-point to 110-basis-point increase in our operating profit margin and includes roughly $40 million of acquisition synergies.","Our EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91 represents 11% to 15% growth over last year and includes the following assumptions. Interest and other expense is expected to be $115 million to $120 million. Our tax rate is expected to be 10% to 11%. And in terms of share repurchases, we expect to spend a similar amount to last year. Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $750 million to $850 million. Using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this represents an increase of roughly $575 million from last year, which is being driven by four main factors.","First, more than $300 million from improved working capital driven by reduced inventory. Second, roughly $140 million from lower expected cash charges absent any new acquisitions. Third, roughly $60 million from expected growth and adjusted net income. And fourth, a $60 million reduction in our pension contribution.","With over $300 million of cash on our balance sheet at yearend, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3 times as well as our expected cash generation in 2016, we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And our strategy is simple: use our cash flow to fund capital investments and our dividend, use debt for acquisitions, and use excess free cash flow to buy back stock.","So, in summary, we generated significant shareholder value over the past several years. And with our focus on driving sales growth along with our continued execution on expanding our margins, we're well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth. Add to that about $800 million in expected cash flow as well as upside from potential acquisitions, and we feel really good about 2016.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional question.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Brean Capital.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital, LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Eric.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital, LLC","Rich and I guess Gerald for you, if we could just dig a little bit deeper on the 4Q revs both from an environment and consumer perspective, walk us through a little bit more how you discern between weather versus just outright weaker traffic or something more structural going on that gives you comfort that we should expect that acceleration into 2016.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, let me talk a little bit about Q4 and then I'll also let Gerald talk about the initiatives going into 2016. You go back to October, it was cold, things were looking really good. November, December came, it was the third warmest November and December since 1895 and December was actually the warmest. And you could actually see the correlation as temperature got above normal, retail traffic dropped and then we saw it impact our POS.","So, I think a lot of it was clearly impacted by that. How much is overall consumer spending? You can't really tell, but clearly I think it was a very unusual holiday period. That said, you expect it to be in our cold weather Activewear areas, it was. That was down about 12% in the quarter, but it was so strong it actually impacted Innerwear, which when you take out the 53rd week was actually down 2% in the quarter. The good thing is, we started to see it rebound in December going into January, and I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk a little bit more about initiatives to drive results in 2016.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","So, as we look forward, we really have a focused set of initiatives that we've built on proven tactics to better drive consistent top-line over time. And really the focus is in two areas. First, we are going to keep doing what's working and that clearly is Innovate-to-Elevate is working, our innovation platforms like X-Temp and our elevated product in Champion are all driving sales increases and we're gaining additional space that we will have going in place for 2016.","There are two areas though where we will refine our strategies a bit. One is in the area of accelerating our growth online. The online channel continues to grow very rapidly in apparel now, 18% of apparel sales are online. We are well positioned there. Our brands hold leading shares already, and our sales, while 7% of our sales are done online today, they are also growing at a double-digit rate. And actually one of our largest customers and our eighth largest customer is a large pure-player, that sales online is growing at approximately 70% rate. So, we are going to invest more resources to drive this business faster, both people \u2013 we are dedicating more people resources, as well as marketing investment to maximize our position in this channel.","Secondly, we are rebalancing our focus a bit on driving our core volume. And really in two areas. If we look at our core business, we've stayed behind our core innovations such as Tagless for a number of years, in our underwear business, for example. And it's time to drive new innovation there. So, you will see innovation coming across our core basics business late in 2016 and into 2017. And secondly, you will see us rebalancing our media to focus more balanced across both the core and our innovation platforms over time. We think these are good strategies that take the best of what we're doing and moderately refines our strategy against basics and gives us confidence that we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for 2016.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital, LLC","And I guess my follow-up would be, just in terms of the cash flow, you've got working cap expected to go down pretty significantly. Just walk through the inventory drawdown, the potential for sort of downtime within manufacturing, how should that impact? And then ultimately on the stepped up cash flow for next year, Rich, maybe just again highlight the acquisition environment, and the pipeline of things that you guys are potentially looking at? Thanks.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start with the inventory drawdown portion of it. Let me just say, first of all, that our inventory levels are high, but the quality is good, as Rick noted. And so, we have good quality, but we'd like to see those levels lower, and we'll take actions to draw that down through the year. And we'll do that through a few ways. First, we always look at where we can is first cutting off outsource production. And second, is we will take a week or so of time out in our internal production. And finally, we will drawdown our work-in-process and raw materials, and Rick referred to some of that last year, we had built up some of that for the internalization of DBApparel, and we'll continue to draw that down over the years, we pull our inventories back in line.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Eric, let me just say this. We've been through the inventory with a fine-tooth comb, so we can stay with a high degree of confidence, there is no markdown risk here, very confident of that. There will be some cost early in the year associated with these actions that Gerald's talked about. We built that into our guidance.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think, there was a third question in there Eric that I'll ask is, you went from inventory all the way to acquisitions, but I'll go ahead and discuss that. Acquisitions is working great for us. There is no ifs, ands or buts. We're doing well with Maidenform. We're still seeing a little bit of the last synergies in 2016, Knights Apparel and Hanes Europe are working extremely well, both beat their plans in 2015, who are in full swing to reap acquisition synergy benefits and so, we feel really good about it. And we've now got the bandwidth to start looking for our next set of acquisitions, and it's part of our strategy and will be part of our strategy, and feel really good about where we are.","Eric Tracy - Brean Capital, LLC","Thanks, guys.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon. Tough quarter. Can you talk about \u2013 did you guys see anything at the retail level in terms of a sell-through in the Innerwear category? It's one of the lower numbers you posted even when you back out all the non-comparable items and FX and acquisitions. Between the Intimates category versus the basics, men's versus women's, is there anything you can glean there to help understand what's going? Or is it really just such a broad-based kind of across the board slowdown in the revenue line?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think when you back out the 53rd week, the Innerwear category in general was down about 2% year-on-year. And clearly it was tied to the fall off in traffic, and we saw it fall off late in December as traffic caught up with those replenishment trends. I think from the standpoint of looking forward, we saw the POS begin to rebuild as traffic built late into holiday and into January. We've seen our basics' POS for example rise into low-single digits. I would say that, as you look through the data you can see that in the bra business, for example, we came off a strong third quarter. Our fourth quarter, when you back out the 53rd week, that business was actually flat in the quarter in spite of the traffic. So, it gives us strong confidence in our brand consolidation strategy and certainly optimistic it will drive that forward.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Omar, let me talk about channel a little bit, because this was really broad-based. We saw it across all channels of trade. I will say however, it was probably a little bit more concentrated in mid-tier and department stores, which if you just think of what they're offering is, it's probably going to be a little bit more weather driven than some of the mass. But it was pretty darn strong across the board, the impact of traffic declines.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good. Does Gerald's comment around Intimates, is that saying something about the basics and the men's side of it and maybe the Innovate-to-Elevate there's a little bit long in the tooth and ready for some new stuff to come in or are you comfortable where you're at?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think it's just the opposite. If you remember in the first half of the year, we're struggling a little bit in Intimates because we're going through the brand transition. We said a lot of that was behind us at sort of late summer. You saw a really good strong third quarter results and then in bras in particular when you back out the 53rd week, we actually had good strong momentum and Gerald actually think it was up slightly in the quarter when you back out the 53rd week. So, I think just tactically we were just better set up there because of some of the things that have happened earlier in the year. I wouldn't read into it negatively about basics.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it, got it. Thanks, guys.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Susan.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, how is it going? Good job in the tough environment. I wanted to follow-up on the DBA acquisition. So, it sounds like the integration is pretty much done now, how should we think about the flow through of synergies this year. Is it going to be more back-end loaded, pretty equal throughout the year or how should we think about that?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We actually said the integration is really now just in full swing, so it's not done. I think we're well on our way. And so, you'll start to see synergies build this year going into 2017, and even into 2018. So, there's a lot of tailwinds to come from that; specifically about this year. Rick, do you want to talk about the overall synergies?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. We expect about $40 million in synergies for the year. The bulk of it will be coming from DBA and Knights Apparel. And it will be a little bit backend loaded, more oriented towards SG&A as is often the case. The initial flow of synergies comes more in SG&A, then the cost for sales synergies come later.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then just one follow-up on the Activewear category, maybe just digging a little bit deeper. So it sounds like you guys feel like it's pretty much weather issues out there, I guess investors have been trying to kind of figure out, is this category slowing just given a lot of excess that we've seen out there across a number of brands, maybe if you can talk about how you feel about the category in general going forward this year?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we still feel bullish about the category. And certainly, the Champion brand ended up at mid single-digits in the sports specialty and mid-tier and department store channels. For the year, it was running well above that through Q3, and then it fell off as the weather related pressures hit our replenishment in that business. But as we look forward in our bookings and so forth into spring, we're very optimistic about where that business is going and expect it to be in that 10%-plus growth range. And there's early signs of recovery in the POS and the mass channel as well. So we're very optimistic about the category going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Hello. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about acquisitions. What types of acquisitions are you looking at? What regions and what categories would you want to enter?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. I know you're pretty familiar with our four criteria, but for those who might not be, I'll just quickly restate them. Obviously in our core categories, complementary revenue growth opportunities, justifiable on the synergies, mainly supply chain, but also SG&A and quickly accretive. After that, we don't have necessarily a prioritization. Anything that falls through that screen would be a viable candidate. So it would either be Innerwear or Activewear, both domestic and international. And I think over time you'll see us have opportunities along all of those dimensions, both Innerwear, Activewear, domestic and international. In terms of the near-term, we're always talking to people and working on things, and as soon as we get a deal signed, we'll let you all know.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much. As a follow-up, could you talk a little bit about e-commerce and how you're thinking about the e-commerce part of your business as it develops, given the challenges we're seeing at retail from a traffic standpoint, from an underlying sell-through standpoint?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, let me just give you a couple of big picture things and I'll turn it over to Gerald to talk about some more of the specifics and reiterate some of his comments from earlier. When you talk about Q4 and you talk about online, I think, a lot of people have also asked, is some of the retail traffic declines driven by channel shift from bricks-and-mortar retailers to online? Holiday was tough for everyone. And, in fact, some of our large Internet pure-play businesses, the growth rates, while they were still strong, were cut by two-thirds in the fourth quarter. So everybody was feeling the impacts of a soft holiday.","So while that shift may be going on, I think, we just need to keep that in perspective. But online here, it's growing, it's growing with our traditional retailers, it's growing through our own efforts and we're also working with pure-plays, and so it clearly needs to be a big area of focus. And Gerald, do you want to highlight a couple of specific things that you're doing.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, I think, first of all, we're really well positioned. Our brands are well positioned in the channel itself. And we're working very carefully with across bricks-and-mortar as well as pure-plays on our own sites to drive the business across all those channels, leveraging our position, our brands and our marketing investments. And as I referenced, certainly with the major pure player, we've seen significant growth. And we expect our overall growth, as we work across all these players, to grow at a double-digit rate going forward to really drive our business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jay.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So a question on the operating margin guidance for 2016, I think, in the FAQ document it says the midpoint of the 2016 guidance implies a 100 basis-point increase in operating profit margin, with more coming from SG&A than gross margin. Can you talk about, within gross margin, obviously, cotton, oil should be benefits. Maybe FX in some of the Asian currencies should be a help. It sounds like one offset is the inventory reductions. But is there any other offsets there? It sounds like the inventory is relatively clean, so you're not kind of anticipating big markdowns. Can you just talk about some of the more levers and drivers of gross margin in 2016?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I think you're going to see a lot of same sorts of things that you've seen in the past. You've got manufacturing cost savings that will flow through, and that will be offset somewhat by the costs associated with the inventory reduction. And so we think that the gross profit margin improvement should be a little more modest than what we've seen in recent years. But, remember, the recent years have been distorted a little bit by things like DBA's P&L structure, which has much higher gross profit margins and much higher SG&A. We've now seen that flow through our P&L and it's now a part of who we are. So we think basically the same drivers, just a little more modest growth than what we've seen.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And I just want to say that \u2013 and thank you for focusing on the operating margin improvement, first, because I just think that is just a fabulous result. And while it may come a little differently spread in 2016 than it has historically, our business model continues to perform extremely well and we're thrilled with that kind of margin improvement.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","500 basis points of operating profit margin improvement since 2012 is not bad.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You can tell we're proud.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Definitely. A 100 basis-point improvement in this environment is terrific. Maybe just to follow-up on that, can you talk about the company's ability to react quickly to changes, say, in the RMB and different aspects of the cost structure that could allow you to maybe go back and find some savings there?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Well, in terms of our exposure to RMB, one of the benefits of making the vast majority of what we sell is we're not nearly as dependent on the RMB as a lot of apparel companies who source heavily from that part of the world. And so, to be honest with you, it's really not that big of a driver. Plus what we do source from China, we do in U.S. dollars. So it has less of an impact on us than on a lot of other apparel companies.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Chad Sutherland on for Taposh. First question, just hoping to dig a little deeper on the quarter-to-date commentary. When you talk about Basics and Champion both being up, is that relatively broad-based and just any detail you'd care to provide on that?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","I think your question is about the POS trends. As the traffic lifted coming through the holiday week into January, we did see a positive lift in POS, and that's what we've seen today. It's early days, but it's certainly favorable and follows the traffic.","Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That makes sense. And then any additional detail? I saw in the FAQ document, the acquisition in Japan related to the Champion brand. I guess, can you talk maybe a little bit about that? And then is it possible to get a breakdown of what other markets maybe there are opportunities around Champion, I guess what markets you're present in in Asia?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, in Japan, we had a licensee for a long period of time. We actually did some of the Champion sales ourselves, but it was with a licensee and we started working with them to actually reacquire the rights, and actually the deal was done last year and it actually starts to flow into 2016. It's relatively small. It's good size for that market. We feel really good about it. I think in total that business, Gerald, will it be close to $100 million I think in 2016? So we feel good about them continuing to drive Hanes and Champion in that market.","We have rights for Champion throughout the Americas and Asia where we can start to use that plugging into the design and the products that we do for the U.S. and continue to expand it in Japan. We've got a business down in Australia that's also leveraging that same product line. And so that's our plan is to continue to drive growth in Champion not only domestically, but internationally as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good evening. Given the amount of volatility we're dealing with with our earnings models across the sector right now, can I just ask you to get a little better sense of the cadence of the year on the top line and the operating margin within the guidance you gave and maybe just a little bit of help on what we should be thinking about in the first quarter to get us off on the right foot to start the year here?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. A couple of things. If you recall from our comments that you probably picked up, Knights Apparel will be incremental to us in the first quarter. That's about $20 million of sales. Then, we acquired them in April, so they'll be anniversaried at that point. We mentioned the $30 million in Japan; that will come a little later in the year in terms of top line. The synergies, as we mentioned, are about $40 million, will be mostly in the back half of the year. And then the $40 million of FX headwinds I would expect to be heavily weighted in the first half and a lot in the first quarter actually. And then we talked about some costs associated with inventory management and that is going to be, again, heavily weighted in the first half of the year and a lot in the first quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. As I look at different revenue scenarios for all the companies in the group here, it's pretty easy to figure out for you guys in particular the incremental margins as revenues come in above plans, since you guys are really good at controlling the costs in even a strong macro. But if the revenues do come in closer to flat, how should we think about the point of fixed versus floating costs and your ability to deliver on the EPS line if the macro works against us? Any kind of quantitative support you could offer there?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","You know, let me just talk about that conceptually.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","In the very short term, it's obviously a little harder to react. Actually given where sales ended up, I was thrilled with the fact that actually our operating margin didn't delever in Q4. So I think our ability to manage it quickly was pretty darn good in that quarter. If it's over a longer period of time and I'm inferring the way you're asking it, if you started to see a much broader base, soft consumer environment that's going to last, our ability to last is substantially greater.","I'd also remind you that in any given quarter, we have a lot of volatility as you've now seen, but in places like Innerwear over the period of a year or so, those types of things will start to work themselves out. In fact in both 2008 and 2009 men's underwear had a lot of volatile quarters, ended up slightly up in both of those years. But over a period of a year or more, our ability to react is pretty high.","Great thing about our business is we've got a lot of things that drive profitability. We've got acquisition synergies, we're independent of the consumer environment, we have strong cash flow that we can use, so we've talked about to pay dividends and buy back stock, we've got other acquisitions to do, and I am very comfortable. As Gerald took you through the sales, what we need to just get through to the low end of our sales range, a lot of it's just the acquisition wrap that we've got plus the absence of one-time things from 2015. So we feel really good about our 2016 numbers to be able to deliver on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, almost good evening. Just a follow-up question on these POS trends and then I have a follow-up on e-commerce. I'm assuming that retailers are in a position to re-order from you from a replenishment perspective based on their POS trends that they are seeing as opposed to kind of tightening their receipt plans. Also, you're up against some big destocking in the first quarter, if I recall. So I just want to make sure we can make that logical conclusion that shipment trends are correlating with the POS trends you're seeing at retail?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Certainly, from the standpoint of our replenishment of Innerwear goods, they will pick up with replenishment as replenishment \u2013 as POS goes, our replenishment will follow. In the case of cold weather goods, if they haven't been taken at this point, those sales are not going to occur now until next year when we go to the cold weather period of next year. But on the replenishable piece of the business, and Innerwear in particularly, you do see that POS pick out the replenishment.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So you are obviously not counting on those cold weather goods in your plan to be shipped?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","No, no, no.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. All right.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, in fact let me actually restate, and Gerald talked about it. When you look at the low-end of our guidance, he explicitly said that we are not assuming in that end any lift from fourth quarter next year. It's basically the same kind of results that you would have seen in 2015. It's not until you start to go to the high-end of our range that we started to actually expect that we begin to see Q4 next year start to normalize; that's an important point.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for highlighting it.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow up on e-commerce. How do you think about investing in your own e-commerce site as a transactional site versus more an informational site as opposed to really partnering up with your omni-channel wholesale customer as well obviously there is the big e-tailer, which you've had a lot of success with Amazon. How do you look at investing your resources across the various alternatives you have, particularly when it pertains to your Amazon and it pertains to your own site?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","First of all, on our own site, what we really believe that there's a true convergence now of where the consumer learns and where the consumer shops, and they make come to your site and learn, they may then go to retail and buy, they may come to your site and learn and go to another site and buy. So we view our site as a very important informational source as well as a selling source, just as we view our presentation at retail as another way to provide information or representing our brands on Amazon is also another way that consumers go and learn, and then they may also go to a store. So it truly is a convergence of the consumer across channels from a communication and purchasing.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, David, I'll share with you an anecdotal piece of data that Gerald and his group put together. And they were tracking where people were doing searches for different products. And actually, when they took the snapshot, 15% of the searches that were being done for some of our products, people were actually doing while they were in a store. And it shows that everything was now totally interconnected. You could be in a Kohl's or a Walmart or whatever and searching the Internet to find out more information to make a purchase decision. So I think it's going to all blend and merge, and we need to be good at all of those things.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen & Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","So just wanted to go back to the inventory. Obviously pretty significantly here you talked about minimum markdown risk, but there's also a lot of inventory in the channel from other brands across apparel. Can you just walk us through why you are so confident there's minimum markdown risk, and what the timing looks like in terms of this inventory drawing down?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, let me break the inventory down in two buckets for you and I think it'll clearly answer your question. In the case of Innerwear, the same inventory is used all year long, so as POS comes back up, then the orders come behind it, and it just continues to ship. In the case of cold weather goods, ours is a fairly basic cold weather goods. So those that didn't sell yesterday are actually goods that we didn't sell in the current season, we can actually carry over and sell again next year. So we don't have any risk in those as well, it's basic fleece and things like that, that we will carry over and sell next year.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I can just shift back to the revenue question, the guidance I think assumes $50 million in revenue from acquisition, can you talk to what you're looking at in terms of acquisitions for 2016 geographically, category wise and the confidence you have in consummating a deal this year?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, the $50 million that you referred to are acquisitions that are already completed, so it's the simply $20 million of wrap of Knights Apparel plus the $30 million additional from reacquiring the rights to Champion Europe. Nothing in our guidance has anything about our future acquisition, and I think that's important. We're now turning our attention to begin looking at acquisitions in 2016 and beyond, but we don't have anything like that built into our guidance.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Actually just to correct, that was Champion Japan, that $30 million.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. I was thinking of Hanes Europe and not Champion Japan. Thank you, Gerald.","John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then just on valuations, it seems like there's been a lot of valuation contraction out there, certainly in the public market. So, are valuations looking more appealing at this point than they were maybe 12 months ago?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think it's fair to say that over time if you go back and look at our Gear for Sports acquisition and Knights Apparel, fairly similar businesses and we probably paid about a turn and a half higher for Knights Apparel than we would have back when we bought Gear for Sports in 2010. How that may change over time, remains to be seen.","What we really focus on is what we're going to do with the acquisition and how much value we can create and we've been thrilled. All of these acquisitions that we've had, the after-tax cash returns are easily in the teens and we're convinced, there's deals out there that we can do over time to continue to drive great value creation for our shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question everyone.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Happy to do it.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a quick one, I guess, Rich, just real quick. In talking about the acquisition of Japan, is there anything that inhibits you from reacquiring the rights of Champion Europe? And is that something that does intrigue you, I think it's a small business? And then, Gerald, just to go back to that eighth largest customer that you referenced. I'm just curious, how that business works relative to your other brick-and-mortar partners? Meaning, how big do you ultimately think that could grow to, is the profitability different, better or worse? And how does the pricing work there, I'm assuming there's no real difference that would create any disparities, but just curious, some color on that whole dynamic?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm not going to talk about any one specific acquisition, and nobody should infer that we're focused on any one thing in particular. Obviously, people do know that Champion Europe was a business that was spun out of Sara Lee or sold out of Sara Lee many, many years ago and it's obviously a candidate that could one day make sense, yet you need a lot of things to fall into place for two people to be able to come together and decide to have a marriage. And so, while it's something that's out there, as you said, it's a relatively small business, and it'll continue to be on our list. What we're focused on is, there's lots of ways for us to create value with acquisition. There's a lot of different types of companies that fit our four criteria. And as we're continuing to work with people when we get a deal done, we'll make sure we announce it.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","And to the second part of the question on the online business. As I have said a minute ago, we go to business online really three ways. For our brick-and-mortar retailers, we have online strategy through our own sites, as well as through pure plays. And generally, we work with all of them. We bring ideas and business and sell similar brands and similar structures to all of them in a wholesale model whether they're bricks-and-mortar online or pure plays and we drive those businesses accordingly and our goal is to be well represented in all of them and grow across those businesses.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking our question. I guess a follow-up on the gross margin guidance for 2016 being a little bit more moderate than historically. Should we expect the opportunity more back half driven given the sales initiative and the near-term, I guess, inventory overhang?","And then secondly, looking at profitability in direct channel, it came down pretty significantly in the quarter and for the year and we know outlet traffic has been difficult. Are you guys reevaluating your commitment to this channel at all. Is there an opportunity to perhaps close some stores as leases come due? Thanks.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Anna, with respect to your first question, yes, I think you can infer from what we've said that gross margins will be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half as a result of the various pieces that we've talked about. In terms of DTC, you got to remember, the 53rd week actually impacts that business disproportionately to some of the other segments, right?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Right, it was $8 million in the fourth quarter...","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","On sales, on sales alone. So, when you look at that, you got to factor that in. In terms of more though to your strategic question, which is the piece of that's the outlet store business, how do we think of it because the other piece within there is our direct-to-consumer online business, which is obviously one we will continue to build and grow that piece.","The outlet business for us has always been there, we're in most of the malls around the country, it's a business that on the margin is a good business for us to be in. It's never going to be a growth driver. In some cases as rents in some places have gone up, it doesn't make sense for us to be there, and if the lease comes up, we'll go ahead and exit from that particular mall. We look at everything on a four-wall profitability basis and as long as the thing's making money, we'll continue to keep the store, and if it's not, we'll let it wind down. But on the flipside, I want to reinforce, the online piece of that's clearly a growth vehicle.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon, everyone.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, how are you?","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm doing well, thanks. You've talked a good amount about the online growth going forward, but as we think about 2016 and even beyond that, and some of the other channels, whether it's mass or department stores or sporting goods stores, where do you see the most opportunity, or what are the growth profiles for each of those channels?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we'd see opportunity actually in all the channels. We don't view online as the only opportunity. Certainly as we look at sporting goods and so forth, there's still quite a bit of distribution to get with our Champion brand. We've expanded quite a bit, but we still see a number of doors and a number of segments within those doors that we don't have distribution. So, we see substantial opportunity there, as well as in the mid-tier channel for the Champion brand.","If we look across the Innerwear, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we continue to expand our innovation platforms like X-Temp. We feel good that with our Intimates brand transition behind us, we've got growth potential there as well. So we're not giving up on any channel. We see significant opportunity across all the channels.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then just in 2015, what did X-Temp and ComfortBlend ultimately represent as a percentage of men's basics and Activewear even? I mean, what could that mix reach in 2016 and are you doing anything differently to get there?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","It was roughly 15% in 2015, the combined of all those together and we expect it to grow as we continue to expand space, and that will be balanced some. As we dial up our innovation in the core, you may see that balance out. But there's still ample growth there and we're taking some of those technologies and then pushing them across other to elements including Champion now as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","It's been speculated that there could be a bankruptcy in the sporting goods arena over the next 6 months to 12 months and I know one of your brands has some exposure to that. How do you incorporate that risk into your guidance and how do you mitigate some of the inventory risk if that were to happen?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we monitor all of our customers' credit profiles very carefully and gear our relationships with them accordingly. I think the one you're specifically referring to potentially having that issue at some point, we manage our position with them very well. If something like that were to happen, it would really not have a material impact on our financials.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then my second question is unrelated, more to do about the European market. Just wondering now that you've had DBApparel in your ownership for a while, just what you've learned about the European market and what opportunity is there in that market for the rest of your portfolio of brands.","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think we've certainly learned that we made a great acquisition with the one we bought. We have a leadership position in a number of countries and we have potential to build across a number of countries with a very strong management team to do that for us.","The apparel business in general is fragmented in Europe, as the continent itself is fragmented into many countries. And so, there is certainly over time are opportunities to look across for broader acquisitions as well as build our own, and we're very bullish on Europe right now as an area of future growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Hello, guys.","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jim.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Rick, a couple of questions for you on the cash flow. Just eyeballing the spread between your actual cash flow and the initial guidance is more than the increase in inventory on a year-to-year basis. Were there other surprise factors that worked against the cash flow during the year? And then looking out to 2016, I'm curious the seasonality of the cash flow for the year. Can you pull some of that earlier in the year \u2013 or help me think through that on a quarterly basis?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I think in terms of 2015, really the main driver of the cash flow shortfall in 2015 really was the inventory when you look at the numbers that almost matched up to what our most recent guidance in 2015 was. That was a sales shortfall, but we continued to have production at levels and we just weren't able to react in time because of the sales shortfall coming so late in the year.","As for 2016, you normally see our cash flow very heavily weighted towards the back end of the year. I think with Gerald and his team on the inventory adjustment programs and the initiatives that they've got, I think you'll see that moderate some. You're still going to see most of the cash flow in the back half of the year, but I don't think you'll see quite as big a peak in 2016 as you saw in 2015.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Kawamoto from D.A. Davidson.","Michael Kawamoto - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hey, guys. This is Michael on for Andrew Burns. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you've seen any changes in how Walmart is operating its basic apparel business, I know they outlined quite a few things on their Analyst Day in November and I wonder if you've seen any changes there, positive or negative?","Richard A. Noll - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Across our businesses, we haven't really seen with any of our customers any significant changes in how we do business. We still have very strong relationships and very strong brand representation with all of them.","Michael Kawamoto - D. A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

King & Associates, Inc.","Good evening, everybody. Gerald, I have a question for you and please forgive me if you were more specific at the redundancy of this question. You mentioned that the point-of-sale trends in late December and through January improved, did they improve to positive or just less negative?","Gerald W. Evans - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And in our basics business they improved to low single-digit positive. And then same in Champion, they were double-digit positive.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much. You did say that and I wanted to verify. Thank you. That's perfect.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (54:51) on for Carla. We had a quick question about your bonds and we see that your bonds are callable now 103.188 (54:56) and it steps down to 102 (54:57) at the end of this year. Do you have any thoughts on a new refinancing or coming back to the high yield market?","Richard D. Moss - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we're always looking at what the economic tradeoffs are in refinancing versus leaving them out there. I will say that when you're looking at $50 million of cash to refinance the bonds of 3% plus, we have to evaluate whether there is not a better place for that $50 million of cash. But we're constantly looking at that, and as it steps down again in December of this year, we'll be keeping a good close eye on it.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Hanesbrands delivered solid results in the third quarter right in line with our guidance. And as we\u2019ve seen throughout the year, our diverse business model offers us many avenues to deliver consistent revenue, profit, and cash flow growth. In the quarter, constant currency revenue increased 2% over prior year. We grew operating profit and earnings per share, while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth.","Operating cash flow increased 47% to more than $300 million and we reduced our net debt by nearly half a billion dollars over prior year. And we achieved these results in spite of apparel traffic trends that were softer than we expected in the United States. We continue to benefit from our multi-year diversification efforts with another quarter of strong performance from our key growth initiatives, including international, consumer directed, and Champion.","Within each of these initiatives, we generated double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanded operating margins. Looking at our growth initiatives, international revenue was $20 million higher than our guidance, driven by stronger than expected performance in both our activewear and innerwear businesses. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 11% over last year.","We also continued to expand international's operating margin in the quarter. And over the past five years, we\u2019ve increased this segment's margin by more than 600 basis points through supply chain optimization and volume driven leverage. International has quickly become our largest reporting segment.","Looking out over the next several years, we expect international to represent an even larger mix of total company revenue and profit through a combination of organic growth initiatives, cross regional opportunities, and complementary acquisitions. With respect to our consumer directed business. Our investments continue to generate strong returns.","In the quarter, revenues increased 13% in constant currency with double-digit growth both domestically and internationally. We have significant momentum and consumer directed with additional opportunities for growth across geographies. For example, the recent launch of our maidenform.com website is driving new users to the brand.","Our Bonds brand generated mid-to-high single digit retail comp growth in the quarter and our Bras N Things business also continued its strong performance with growth in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. We\u2019re redesigning our Champion website with a mobile first approach to significantly improve the consumer experience and increase engagement globally.","We\u2019ve also increased brand in content investments on several social media platforms behind a number of our brands. And we\u2019re strategically investing in branded stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, and the United States. Consumer directed currently accounts for 23% of total company sales, and looking forward, we expect consumer directed growth to continue to outpace our category growth rates.","Turning to Champion, we continue to see solid double-digit growth. Excluding C9, global Champion sales increased 26% in constant currency during the quarter. This was ahead of our expectations for the third straight quarter this year. We\u2019re also expanding margins in our Champion business as our brand investments normalize and we leverage prior distribution investments.","Global Champion has generated over $1 billion of incremental sales in just three years, and as dollar growth continues to increase. Year-to-date, on a constant currency basis, global champion revenue has increased approximately $470 million. The growth through the first nine months of this year is already more than $100 million higher than the growth at all of 2018.","Looking ahead, we believe Champion is well-positioned to generate another billion dollars of growth over the next several years. Now, we have several factors supporting our view. We see strong secular trends within the activewear category. Champion's brand equity scores are growing, particularly with Gen Z and Millennials.","We\u2019re expanding Champions product portfolio, including a broader assortment within our performance, kids and women's lines as well as in casual footwear and accessories. And we\u2019re increasing distribution in large economies such as China and South Korea. All of which positions us for continued double-digit Champion growth in 2020 and beyond.","We believe we have strong momentum and long runways in each of our growth initiatives. This, along with contributions from allocating our strong cash generation should drive continued long-term revenue, profit, and cash flow growth for the total company. Touching on our U.S. innerwear business, we continue to execute our strategy to return this business to growth.","In the quarter, we delivered approximately $580 million of revenue. Sales were modestly below our expectations, driven by the impact of softer than expected retail traffic trends on our basics business. Despite the challenging environment, over the past year, our basic shares have remained stable, while our Comfort Flex Fit and X-Temp innovations continue to expand.","Our intimates business performed in-line with our expectations for the quarter. Shapewear delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth, and we saw early signs of success with our bra innovations, positioning our intimates business from improved revenue trends in the coming quarter.","Looking to the fourth quarter for total U.S. innerwear, we expect sequentially improving revenue trends and strong margin improvement as we benefit from our brand investments and innovation. We anniversary a large retailer bankruptcy and we benefit from our price increases as commodity pressures have peaked.","So, in closing, we delivered solid third quarter results. Our diversified business model continues to produce revenue, profit, and operating cash flow growth. With our strong cash generation year-to-date, we\u2019re approximately $100 million ahead of last year, and well-positioned to deliver our full-year cash flow goal, and our leverage is coming down positioning us for higher shareholder returns in 2020 as we will once again have acquisitions and share buybacks at our disposal.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry Hytinen","Thanks, Gerald. We delivered solid third quarter results with revenue and earnings per share coming in towards the high-end of our guidance. For the quarter, sales were $1.87 billion and adjusted operating profit was $280 million both increasing 1% over last year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4%, and GAAP per share increased 9%. Cash flow from operations of $302 million increased 47%, and net debt declined $470 million from a year ago.","With that summary, let\u2019s turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased $18 million or 1% over last year, despite a $23 million headwind from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, sales were up over 2% or $42 million. Adjusted gross margin of 38.7% declined 50 basis points over last year. The impact from foreign exchange rates drove 20 basis points of the decline with lower innerwear margins accounting for the remainder. ","Higher Champion margins, partially offset these items. The price increases we implemented earlier in the year offset input cost inflation in the quarter. As we said before, Q3 was expected to be the peak for commodity cost. Now that we're past the peak, looking to the fourth quarter, we expect the net benefit from pricing to drive gross margin expansion over prior year.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $280 million. This included $3 million of currency headwinds and $11 million of growth-related investments as compared to last year. Our adjusted operating margin of 15% was consistent with prior year. For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges were $10 million. Our tax rate of 14.1% was in line with our forecast, and adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.54 and $0.51 respectively. ","Now, let me take you through our segment performance. U.S. innerwear sales declined 3.5%, compared to last year, driven by headwinds from retail and bankruptcies, as well as softer apparel traffic trends. For the quarter, basics revenue declined 2%, while intimate was down in-line with our expectations.","Innerwear's operating margin of 21% was down 110 basis points, compared to prior year, due to volume, mix and increased investments to support our intimate\u2019s business. And as previously discussed, higher commodity cost in the quarter were offset by pricing.","Turning to our U.S. Activewear segment, as we discussed before, we're focused on remixing parts of our activewear business to branded products, which drives improving margins. Therefore, for the quarter, revenue declined 1%, while operating profit increased 4% as compared to last year.","Champion activewear sales, excluding C9, increased more than 18% over last year. C9 revenue was consistent with prior year and ahead of our expectation, due to strong sell-through trends. And sales in the remainder of our activewear segment declined approximately $45 million as compared to last year. This was driven by the previously disclosed exit of commodity programs in the mass channel, which represented $30 million of sales last year, as well as softer trends in the printwear channel.","Activewear's operating margin increased 90 basis points to 17.8% even with higher levels of investments to support our growth initiatives. The strong margin performance was driven by improved Champion profitability, favorable contribution from our remixing activity and the benefit from pricing.","In our international segment, reported sales increased more than 7%, and constant currency sales increased 11% or $68 million driven by growth in both our activewear and innerwear businesses in the quarter. International's operating margin of 16.2% was up slightly over last year. This marks its fifth consecutive quarter above the company average and we see additional opportunities for margin expansion going forward.","Touching briefly on our Global Champion business, excluding C9, constant currency sales increased 26% over prior year well ahead of our expectations. This consisted of 29% growth in our domestic Champion business and 24% growth in Champion international.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated $302 million in cash flow from operations, an increase of $96 million, compared to last year. The growth was driven by improved working capital performance and higher GAAP net income. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is up 73% as compared to last year.","Consistent with our cash generation and debt reduction strategy, our teams drove a five-day improvement in our cash cycle over last year. On a sequential basis, we reduced our inventory balance by $125 million in our net debt by approximately $250 million. And compared to last year, our net debt is down $470 million.","Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down half turn from last year's 3.8 times and down two-tenths from last quarter's 3.5x. We\u2019re on track to lower our leverage to 2.9 times by the end of the year. And now turning to guidance, I'll point you to our press release and FAQ document for more details, however I would like to share a few thoughts to frame our outlook.","For the full year, we narrowed our guidance range as for revenue, operating profit, and earnings per share. We raised the midpoint of our revenue range to reflect stronger than expected performances in our Champion and international businesses. We tightened the high-end of our operating profit range, and we raised the midpoint of our EPS range, driven by lower interest expense.","Today, we also issued fourth quarter guidance, which at the midpoint implies total sales of consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis or down less than 1.5% on a reported basis. Our guidance reflects nearly $20 million of currency headwinds in the fourth quarter, as well as headwinds from the exited commodity programs in the winddown of C9.","With respect to our segments, the midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance assumes a decline of approximately 2% in our U.S. innerwear segment. This outlook reflects improving sequential trends, including the anniversary of the Sears bankruptcy. In U.S. activewear, the midpoint of our guidance assumes a revenue decline of approximately 7% over last year. This is unchanged from our prior outlook although we now expect even stronger Champion growth in the quarter.","We increased our fourth quarter Champion activewear forecast by approximately $15 million to reflect a strong demand trends Gerald mentioned. We now expect Champion activewear, excluding C9 to increase at a high teens rate as compared to our prior outlook for a low double-digit growth. And reflecting my earlier comments, we\u2019ve taken a more cautious outlook within the printwear channel.","In our international segment, the midpoint of our guidance assumes reported sales growth of approximately 4% in constant currency sales growth of approximately 7%. This is above our prior outlook as we've experienced stronger than expected performance all year from our international business.","Our fourth quarter operating profit range is $259 million to $284 million and reflects a $3 million headwind from exchange rates. At the midpoint, our guidance implies a $12 million increase as compared to prior year. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $51 million.","Our fourth quarter guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately 14%, diluted shares outstanding of slightly less than 366 million and approximately $11 million of acquisition integration and supply chain related charges. Therefore, at the midpoint, our fourth quarter adjusted net income guidance is approximately $190 million, and our guidance for adjusted and GAAP earnings per share range from $0.48 to $0.54 and $0.46 to $0.52 respectively.","So, in closing, we delivered another quarter of solid results once again underscoring the benefits of our diversified business model. Our key growth initiatives, including Champion and international continue to outperform our expectations. We\u2019re generating higher levels of operating cash flow and our leverage is coming down positioning us for higher shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Anderson with B Riley FBR. Your line is now open.","Susan Anderson","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering on the Basics pressure in the quarter, was this consumer not accepting price increases or was it mainly just lower traffic in the closed-doors? And then also maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing impact in the quarter, and then also the drivers that you see for fourth quarter for Basics and I guess the Innerwear category as a whole? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Sure, Susan. Let me take the first half and I'll let Barry touch a little bit more on the pricing at the end. From the standpoint, let me just start with the quarter. We're very pleased with our quarter, once again coming in at the higher end of our expectations on sales and earnings. And from the standpoint of our diversified business, it is really continuing to show through and we love the way our growth initiatives continue to outperform.","Within the Innerwear segment, we also \u2013 as I noted, we delivered $580 million of sales in the quarter, and we viewed it as a solid quarter for Innerwear. Sales were modestly below our midpoint of our expectations and now it's about $8 million, $9 million, somewhere in there. And we really did see a little slower retail traffic than we expected early in the quarter and particular intended to pick up a bit as we work through, and more normalized as we work through, and actually seems early in October to be normalized as well.","So, we view this more as a short-term fluctuation in anything of significance to worry about underneath. We continue to see our Basics business. Our shares are performing very nicely as we look out over the last 12 months in spite of the challenging business environment and our innovations are gaining traction. For example, our Comfort Flex Fit POS continues to be up double digits even 18 months after its introduction, and we've now continued to roll that out into women's underwear and socks.","So, we feel like the things we've set out to accomplish in Innerwear are going fine on the Basics side on intimates, and intimates came in once again, and has all year right on where our expectations, where we've started to see in early on the shapewear performance. It was our fifth consecutive quarter of growth there. We're seeing our innovations in bras begin to get traction as well.","So, as we look to the fourth quarter, we do have an expectation of sequentially improving revenue results with particularly good results or movement in our intimates business, and that's really all behind our investments in our brands and our innovations, as well as we are overlapping a fairly significant retail bankruptcy in the quarter as well.","And then from a margin standpoint, our prices have been in place all year, and we're passing the peak of commodities and are beginning to see some supply chain efficiency that give us confidence on the margin \u2013 op margin side as well.","So, Barry do you want to touch a little bit on the pricing in particular?","Barry Hytinen","I think you hit the high points there, Gerald. Susan, hi, it's Barry. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We got all the pricing we expected. And as you recall from earlier in the year that was 4%, 5% on the vast majority of our Innerwear business. So, that is flowing through and has been for the last couple of quarters. And the element related to the fourth quarter is that input costs are meaningfully down as we move forward, and we've got a nice cost position. ","So, from the standpoint of what you'll see is the net benefit of that pricing really starts to flow into our gross margin, as we've expected in the \u2013 for the fourth quarter for some time and that will help drive improved Innerwear operating margins as we move through the remainder of the year. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. So, asked about the Champion growth, 26% growth ex-FX outside of C9 for Champion. You're talking about double-digit growth next year. It sounds like you're raising that target from $2 billion to $3 billion in the long-term growth. You gave us some color on fiscal 2020, and maybe just talk about the shape of fiscal 2020? Do you think you can deliver positive growth for all the quarters of fiscal 2020? Because you know the compares are a little tougher in the first part of year than there will be in the next part of the year. So, maybe you could just help us there, and then talk about what the addition of distribution partners in South Korea and the second one in China, made the business? Will that be additive to sales right away and what kind of benefit might that adds to the Champion business?","Gerald Evans","No, we're very pleased. Thank you for the question on Champion. We're very pleased with how it performed once again. It once again outperformed our expectations, and you noted it was strong, up 26%, up 29% domestically, 24% globally up across our Innerwear, as well as our Activewear businesses, so I'm feeling really good about that. And we often get tangled up in the percentages, but when we look at the real growth, over $1 billion of growth in three years is just phenomenal and we're already ahead of pace by $100 million over the full growth last year.","So, we couldn't be happier with where it's going. We will surpass our $2 billion goal next year, two years early, and we do believe that, that that next billion can emerge over the next few years. So, we've got a lot of momentum behind it. You heard that we're seeing not only the secular trends in Activewear, but the equity scores growing, we're expanding our product lines and the new geographies to your question.","I think, I spoke last time about moving into China with a second partner which also puts us online. We've now added South Korea into that mix as well. So, tremendous opportunity there, and we do expect double-digit growth and beyond, and it will be an important driver as we look to next year from the standpoint of how the business performs in total and so we couldn't be happier with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Westcott Rochette","Hi, guys. This is Westcott on for Omar. I just have some more questions on Champion. You said you're going to be rolling out an updated online platform mobile-first, has an investment already kind of been absorbed, or is there an increased investment that need to go, that you need to make to expand that program? And thinking about the demand \u2013 balancing the demand, particularly domestically, I think a lot of people see the Champion product used as a promotion driver from a lot of your partners. Wondering how you balance like the demand aspect of keeping the demand high, but not getting people used to promo? Thanks a lot, guys.","Gerald Evans","Well, I think, let me just say, from the standpoint of the investment, we've been making that investment all year in the platform that we're going to roll. It comes active, the first of next year. So, that's already underway for Champion and it's an important part of the broader push we've got behind Champion in the digital push.","From the standpoint of the brands, nothing could be farther than the truth. It is prestigious of promotion brand. It actually continues to press its limits on price and premium position, and well segmented across the channels and we think there's a lot of legs to continue to push it even higher over time, as well as across the women's business, as kids and in performance. So, we feel good about the brand. As I noted in my comments, we think there's a lot of room to grow, and a lot of strength in this brand.","Barry Hytinen","And Westcott, it's Barry. I think I'll just add as a reminder, something we've made the point about throughout the year is our level of investments year-on-year to support brands and growth will be consistent in the fourth quarter of this year, whereas it's been a significant increase year-on-year through the first three quarters as you'll recall. ","Last year, we elevated the level of investments and such that earlier in the year, we've said by the time we get to the fourth quarter, that will be kind of consistent year-on-year. So, that will no longer be a headwind to profitability, and will be part of the reason why the operating margin start to expand. So, we're looking forward to good trends here in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Just a couple quickly. As you look at the expectation for pricing the flow through better in fourth quarter as the commodities come down. How should we think about the competition and what they may do with that expanding margin opportunity? Is there any risk we should think about, particularly some of the private label competitors out there that they try to reinvest some of that commodity benefit into lower \u2013 lowering the pricing spread? And then I also wanted to ask on, if you could help us unpack the gross margin in the quarter a little more between Champion and some of the Innerwear pressure that you saw? Obviously, I think you said you saw most of the pressure, excluding Champion. I think, you're expecting gross to just be about flattish. So, maybe just help us dimensionalize that and help us think forward on it a little bit? Thank you.","Gerald Evans","Yes, let me take the first half of that, and I'll let Barry take your second half. From the standpoint of pricing, our pricing has been in place since mid-February, and we've seen \u2013 as we've commented before, we've seen a number of competitors \u2013 and follow in different areas, as well as we've seen private label take pricing in certain areas. So, from the standpoint, these were \u2013 our prices were put in place to maintain our margins in the face of rising commodity and input costs, and we've seen others follow for the same reason to maintain their margins, I assume. So, we feel our pricing is in place and well-positioned.","Barry Hytinen","Yes, Michael. Hi, it's Barry. Good morning. You asked about the margin in the quarter. So, gross margin was down slightly below our forecast. I'd say there were three things that I would highlight as it relates to gross margin year-on-year. First thing is similar to earlier in the year, FX continues to be a big headwind and costs us about 20 basis points versus last year.","Second is, pricing Champion profitability improvement as you mentioned has continued and Activewear remixing all of those are quite favorable to growth and will continue to be in the fourth quarter. And then third, that was offset by higher commodity cost and Innerwear margins really related to mix and leverage. And as we look forward, we see that getting much better, actually, as we have a much better visibility on cost position getting better as we overlap these peak commodity costs as we've forecasted earlier in prior calls. And just as a reminder, year-to-date, gross margin is actually up 10 basis points on a constant currency basis and slightly down on a reported basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez","Hi, thanks, guys. Can you just talk about pricing on the Champion side? I'm curious about AURs and your direct-to-consumer business for Champion, and how much is price a driver of Champion sales in the wholesale business as well? If price is a driver, curious how much is mix shift within the Champion brand versus higher prices on unlike items? And also, if you could \u2013 also on Champion, can you talk about the percentage of that brand sales coming from men's, women's, kid's and where you think those percentages might go couple of years down the line? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Yes. Let me just take that. From the standpoint of price versus other means of growth, this business is growing at such a phenomenal level. It's a combination of all of that. It is a combination that continuing to push up to the more premium levels, but importantly it's continuing to build our distribution within our current customers across geographies and into new customers. So, it's just all the momentum that you would expect. I mean this is phenomenal growth here, so it's not one item that's driving this growth.","From the standpoint of the business mix today, it's more mixed into the men's side of things, but we certainly see the opportunity to continue to make that a bigger mix of women's, and then kids is an area of tremendous opportunity as well. And also, the performance across the genders, the performance of products across the genders is a small, but growing area that we also see as a growth potential for us. So, as you can tell, we are very optimistic and very bullish on this brand, because we see lots of ways to keep growing it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi. Thanks for taking your questions. Given the very good growth in international, would you discuss where you believe we are in the maturity curve with respect to Champion outside the U.S. specifically? How the 24% international growth in the quarter might compare to growth next year? And how much of that you expect to be driven by adding distribution partners, as opposed to organic growth with existing ones?","Gerald Evans","Yes, let me just say, we're delighted with the International business and how well it's done, up 11% in constant currency, 7% in actual is phenomenal growth in that business and it's another quarter in a row that we've done that, and we've done it all year long. And this was a great indication of the power of the total business model. We saw growth in both our Innerwear and Activewear businesses.","We commented that Champion was up 24%, but the Innerwear business was up mid-single-digit. And if I dig down more on that Innerwear business in total, there\u2019s growth across a number of geographies, the Hanesbrands delivered nice growth across Mexico, Japan, Canada, and Philippines. The Bonds brand and Bras N Things brand grew nicely in Australia, New Zealand and of course we saw Champion growth across the region.","So, from the standpoint of our growth, we've got a lot of room here to grow as well. And from the standpoint of new areas, we've obviously added a second distributor in China that we believe will quickly make China our second largest geography for Champion. As we look to next year and beyond, we just added a new distributor as we noted in our comments in Korea, that opens up that sizable economy to us as well. So, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity to keep driving this business forward. It already is our business segment, and as I noted in my comments, I would expect it to get larger over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi, guys, this is [Matt] on for Ike. I appreciate the color on gross margin in 3Q, and getting to 4Q operating margins, should we continue to expect modest leverage on \u2013 deleverage on the SG&A side? And then as far as the updated guidance, can you just help us quantify the revised outlook for the U.S. retail market versus prior plan and kind of the longevity of those expectations going forward?","Barry Hytinen","Okay. Hi, Matt, this is Barry. I'll do the gross margin point, and then I'll let Gerald talk a little bit about retail. Yes, thanks for the question on the fourth quarter profit. At the midpoint, let me help you frame that. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our outlook assumes gross margin is up about 100 basis points and operating margin is up about 90 basis points, which equates to the $12 million more operating profit we have in the guidance year-on-year. I think the easiest way to explain that is to go right through the expectations that we have by segment.","So, on a year-over-year basis in U.S. Innerwear, we have both gross and operating margins up about 100 basis points, which when combined with our sales guidance is roughly $138 million of operating profit, which is an increase of $4 million year-on-year. I think a good way to explain how Innerwear expectation is developed is looking at it sequentially. As you'll see when comparing our fourth quarter guidance with the third quarter performance, the absolute sales level are basically the same and the pricing benefit is consistent.","So, if I explain Innerwear sequentially, our guidance would equate to about $16 million more profit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And there are two drivers. First is, we have $10 million to $11 million of benefit due to improved supply chain efficiencies and lower input cost, and I'll note, we have very high visibility on those improvements. And then secondly, we'll have less promotional activity and better mix and lower expense, which is just seasonal, and those combined for about $5 million of sequential profit increase. And when you put that in your model, I think you'll see that it arrives at the guidance I referenced.","Now within U.S. Activewear, our guidance assumes operating profit dollars are consistent year-on-year based on our sales guidance, which puts operating margin up a little over 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year for U.S. Activewear. Now, that's all explained through the remixing activity we've had underway in the segment to drive the improved profitability we've been seeing, which is really driven off the few factors. ","First, Champion is going to grow nicely again and we're seeing strong margin improvement that will more than offset the decline we projected in C9. We have the benefit from the exited commodity programs, we call that was $20 million of sales last year with essentially no profit. And then, thirdly, as we noted in the commentary, we've got a sales decline in our printwear channel based on how that channel is developing and that's really a lower margin portion of the Activewear segment. So, that will get you to flat profit dollars in the quarter year-on-year.","And internationally, we're using incremental margin on the $25 million of reported sales increase that would get to about $6 million more profit, and you get about $1 million better from our other segment and corporate cost being consistent. And I think, at this point, I'll just remind everyone one more time that at a total level for the company, brand investment will be equivalent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. So, all in all, we have high visibility on the gross margin expansion, which with the good cost controls we've got underway will yield the increased operating profit that our guidance is calling for.","Gerald Evans","And I'll just jump on the retail side of things, just to finish the color on that side, and much of this was in my comments. Look, we feel good that sequentially we will see improvement in our Innerwear business based on the innovations that we have in place and the brand investment, as well as we do overlap a pretty significant bankruptcy in the third quarter of last year of this past year. So, from the U.S. Innerwear side, we feel that we've got good momentum there and we certainly have the prices in place to help propel that as well.","On the Activewear side, we're effectively booked. We can see our bookings at this point in time and Champion's driving the vast majority of that business. So, we feel that we've got a very thoughtful plan from the standpoint of U.S. Innerwear. We said all year, we were going to view the retail environment with caution, and we continue to do that in our guidance for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Swartz of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","David Swartz","Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the slowness in the printwear market and also your outlook and strategy in the long-term for printwear? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Sure. Let me take that. From the standpoint of printwear, printwear is a fairly small part of our total Activewear business. It's a business that tends to be a bit more sensitive to economic fluctuations and so forth in the market. And so, it was a small fluctuation of what we expect in the third quarter about $15 million or so, and we projected a similar sort of level of impact in the fourth quarter out of caution. We'll see how that plays out, but it's a business that we manage tightly, and it's one you may recall, a number of years ago we restructured a bit the focus more on the branded elements of that, and that's how we still run the business today.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to the International segment, the constant currency revenue growth here has been very consistent as has the margin profile all year. Can you just update us on the long-term thinking around this, the growth drivers, as well as the margin profile, both for not just long-term, but also for the fourth quarter as well?","Gerald Evans","Yes, let me take it from the growth drivers, and I'll let Barry jump in if he wants on \u2013 a little bit on the margin profile side of things, but clearly what we're seeing is early on was building this international presence through our acquisition strategy, which has proven to be very effective in broadening our business in a profitable manner. And we're now building upon that with organic growth and throughout we've seen the synergies come through from both the leverage of our scale, but also from our supply chain benefit.","And this business has gone from a high-single digit kind of business to a nice business outperforming the corporate average very quickly. And we think there's room to grow. And then this thing should become a bigger part of our business over time. And as it becomes a bigger part of the business, you would expect some additional scaling through the margin side. Barry, do you have anything to add?","Barry Hytinen","Hi, John, this is Barry. Good morning. I agree with your points. Thank you for them that the International business is continuing to develop exceptionally well. We beat our guidance in the quarter by $20 million on a reported basis, and even more on constant currency. I want to congratulate the team on the performance, because it's really been strong across all regions. And year-to-date, on a constant currency basis, the team has delivered growth in sales and profits in all of our regions. And we expect margin to be up in the fourth quarter and we have a modest amount of margin improvement in there that may just prove to be conservative.","In the third quarter, we increased some level of brand investment. We won't have that as a headwind in the fourth quarter year-on-year. And so, as we move into 2020 and beyond, we see the opportunity for our International margins to continue to expand, thanks to leverage mix, pricing and the underlying trends there are very good. So, we feel great about how the International business is developing. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Carla Casella with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Carla Casella","Hi. You may have answered this, but I may have missed it. Can you just give us an update on how you're viewing inventory both in the channel, as well as your own on the balance sheet, and your comfort level with both?","Gerald Evans","Yes, let me take the channel part of that, and I'll let Barry take our balance sheet part of that. From the standpoint of channel, we feel like we're well-positioned. The fluctuation that we saw in traffic a bit early in the quarter was \u2013 our business is replenishable in the Innerwear side, so when traffic fluctuates, the customers don't reorder quite as much, so the inventory stays in line. And certainly, we entered the fourth quarter with our inventory in line and we feel that we've done so in the Activewear side. And as we look across the global businesses, we have a good snapshot, as well as we're positioned around the world as we want to be going in the fourth quarter from the retail side of things. Barry, you want to take?","Barry Hytinen","Hi, Carla. Thank you for the question. Inventory was down $125 million from the second quarter, down versus last year as well. We improved days of inventory. I think the team is doing a great job with respect to it. As you'll recall, earlier in the year, we noted that we had invested some in front of some of the Champion growth to fund that, and that over the next couple of quarters, we'll be seeing inventory come down.","Obviously, we did that in the third quarter, and we expect to continue to see inventory coming down in the fourth. And over the next several years, I think the team is very focused on driving improved days of inventory and we would expect that to be a benefit to working capital in the future. So, appreciate the question. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Barry, with sidelines to be in \u2013 within the target leverage ratio into 2020, can you talk about how you think about use of cash flow thereafter? Do you consider share repurchases in the context of the share price or how do you prioritize that versus M&A opportunities to further diversify the business? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Hi, Jim, this is Gerald. And yes, we are doing a great job on bringing down our leverage, and we will be back in our range as we've said, we will by the end of the year. And certainly, we are most comfortable operating in that debt range of two times to three times net debt-to-EBITDA. From the standpoint of what that allows us to do, it allows us to introduce both share repurchases and acquisitions back into our tool box, if you will, to drive shareholder returns.","And I think we've done a nice job over time of balancing the two and we will certainly continue to balance the two to drive the long and the best return for our shareholders at the given time. And I think you should expect that the acquisitions will be part of that mix over time. So, our goal has been to get back in that range, and we'll be solidly there next year to unleash the power of our \u2013 full power of our capital allocation model.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to T.C.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the floor over to T.C. Robillard, Chief Investment Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the second quarter of 2017. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.

With me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. For today's call, Gerald and Rick will provide some brief remarks and then we'll open it up to your questions.","I'll now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. Hanesbrands delivered solid results for the quarter, as revenue and earnings per share were right in line with our guidance. And cash flow from operations year-to-date was up over $160 million from last year. Overall, the year is unfolding as expected and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the remainder of the year.","With respect to our revenue outlook, we saw two key trends in the quarter that further support our confidence for return to organic growth in the third and fourth quarters. First, was the continued sequential improvement in organic revenue trends, even with an unexpected timing shift of sales into the third quarter within our sports apparel business. This sequential improvement was led by our Innerwear segment, which delivered revenue that was right in line with our guidance. For the quarter, we saw continued progress in our innerwear trends as we gain additional share in basics and we pass the initial impact from door closings. Our Innerwear business remains on track to return to growth in the second half, driven by stabilizing shelf space in our intimates business and continued momentum in our basics business behind our FreshIQ innovation.","The second key trend was the ongoing strong performance from both of our global growth initiatives as Champion sales worldwide increased approximately 7%. While our global online revenue growth accelerated to roughly 25%. In fact, we saw accelerating online growth in all of our key regions including the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as in key product categories such as basics, intimates and activewear. Also adding to our confidence for return to organic revenue growth in the second half are the various items that affect the year-over-year comparisons, such as the lapping of our catalog exit, the inclusion of our fast-growing acquisitions into our base and the expected shift in back-to-school timing.","In terms of our outlook for continuing earnings and profit growth in the second half, our confidence is being driven by ongoing efficiency gains within our supply chain, acquisition synergies that are on track and cost savings from Project Booster head count actions. And with respect to our confidence regarding our outlook for cash flow from operations, our cash flow generation to-date remains substantially ahead of last year as we are executing our plans to drive structural improvements in working capital.","So in summary, we have a number of positive trends building in our business to go along with solid first half results that were in line with our expectation. That's why I am confident in our ability to deliver on all facets of our full-year guidance. And when we look beyond this year, we believe the strength of our brands, the power of our company-owned manufacturing model, and the expected benefit from Project Booster position us extremely well to exit 2019 at a run rate of more than $1 billion in cash flow from operations.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. Through the second quarter, year-to-date revenue and earnings per share were in line with our guidance and we continue to generate cash at a faster pace than last year. We're tracking through our plan for the full-year and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the second half. For the quarter, sales increased 12% over last year, driven by roughly $220 million of acquisition contributions. Gross margin improved 100 basis points over last year to 39.5%, driven by acquisition related mix as well as efficiency gains within our supply chain.","Operating margin of 15.5% was better than our guidance. And when compared to last year, our operating margin was affected by roughly $8 million of Booster-related expenses as well as the short-term dilution from acquisitions. The tax rate was 6% in the quarter, which was in line with our full year outlook and earnings per share of $0.53 was within our guidance range and included a $0.02 per share impact from Booster-related expenses.","Looking at our segments, Innerwear sales were in line with our guidance as the 2.5% decline represented another quarter of sequential improvement. Point of sale trends remained steady during the quarter, while performance was mixed by retailer and channel. In our basics business, we gained share in the quarter driven by men's underwear as well as strong gains in both socks and kids' underwear. In intimates, shipments improved sequentially as we saw improving broad trends at certain key retailers. With respect to Innerwear's operating margins, the decline versus last year was driven by the combination of lower sales and Project Booster related expenses. And as we look to the second half, we expect operating margins to expand driven by sales leverage and the expense savings from Project Booster.","Turning to our Activewear segment, sales increased roughly 1% over last year as the addition of GTM and the strength in our Hanes business more than offset the last of the impact from The Sports Authority bankruptcy and the late quarter timing shift in our sports apparel business. As we look to the second half, we expect an acceleration in Activewear's growth driven by our Champion in sports apparel businesses. The operating margin decline versus last year in Activewear was driven by short-term acquisition related dilution as well as lower royalty revenues due to the bankruptcy of a licensee.","Switching to our International segment, sales growth was driven by contributions from last year's acquisitions as well as the continued growth of our Hanes and Champion brands in Asia. Our acquired businesses continued to perform well, as they were above plan in the quarter, while our Asia business delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Operating margin of 12.3%, increased 370 basis points over last year, driven by synergies in Europe, as well as a positive product mix in Asia.","With respect to balance sheet and cash flow highlights, our core inventory declined roughly 7% over last year while cash flow from operations year-to-date improved $163 million over prior year, as we continue to drive structural improvements in working capital.","Turning to guidance, we reiterated our full year outlook, while also providing third quarter guidance. So, I'll point you to the press release and our FAQ document for any detail. As you can see, our third quarter guidance implies total sales growth of roughly 2.5%, which we also believe is a good growth rate to use for the fourth quarter. In fact, as I look at both the third and fourth quarter consensus estimates, they're essentially in line with our expectations from a standpoint of revenue, operating profit and earnings per share.","So, to wrap up, the year is unfolding as expected. Trends are improving across our business, particularly within U.S. Innerwear. We're seeing strong momentum in our global growth initiatives, both Champion and online. Structural improvements in working capital are driving better cash flow generation. And as a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions, and we'll continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets. Susan, your line is open.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. Sorry, forgot to hit the mute button. Congrats on the quarter, nice to see that sequential improvement in Innerwear. Quick question on the Activewear front, maybe a little bit more color on the timing of the shift of the athletic orders in the third quarter, is that mainly the Gear product shifting and then also the bankruptcy impact, is that mainly the licensee impact or is it some of the smaller sporting goods retailers?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","So let me answer the first half of that question. I'll let Rick answer the last half about the bankruptcy. But beginning with the quarter for Activewear, it was up low-single-digits, we saw particularly strong performance out of our Hanes Activewear business during the quarter as well as our online business was up a strong double-digit rate in the Activewear business as well. We did have a couple points of headwind from the last of the TSA bankruptcies. We overlapped that. And then there was a modest shift late in the quarter of some sports apparel business into the third quarter from the second quarter.","From the standpoint of the outlook though, we're very confident and continuing to see accelerating growth as we look to the second half. The overall Activewear categories remain strong for us. The sports apparel business is always a very strong quarter in the third quarter and the products that we carried from or, the orders we carried from the second quarter to the third quarter, we already see shipping which gives us confidence that we will ship that as well. And then we have a good look at our order book this time of year and we have a good view of the business going forward on that business. And then finally, we have finally overlapped the TSA bankruptcy, The Sports Authority bankruptcy of last year. There is an awful lot of good things to drive momentum in Activewear as we look toward the balance of the year.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","And with respect to the profitability comment, Payless ShoeSource has been our Champion athletic shoe licensee for several years. I'm sure you're aware they declared a bankruptcy little earlier this year. We don't actually sell anything to them. They are a licensee. The royalty income really didn't have much, really any material impact on our top line, but did have an impact on the bottom line in the Activewear business. That's a transitory thing. We factored all this into our guidance for the back half of the year, that's what the bankruptcy was.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the online business, nice to see that strong growth there. Maybe if you can just give some color on what you are seeing in terms of the growth coming from key online players and then also what you are seeing at your brick-and-mortar retailers from their online business. Are you seeing big differences in growth there?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of the online business, we've been focusing on this for some period of time and it's become a substantial business for now. It's roughly a $600 million business and it's growing at a strong double digit rate. So, we're very excited about the trends that we're seeing and they were global. We saw a 25% growth rate across the world from that standpoint and we had double digit rates in all of our markets and across all of our core categories: basics, innerwear, and activewear. And to your specific point, within the channels within online, we saw nice solid growth across our own sites, across our brick-and-mortar partners as well as our pure-play.","So, we really think the time we spent focusing on building our presence in this channel is really paying dividends now and that's why part of our Project Booster is to continue to invest in this area both from a people resources standpoint, but continuing to broaden our assortment online and certainly even as we look at our media to spend more of it in the digital world, engage the consumer there. So, we feel really good about the progress there and we feel we're well on our way that over the next couple years, online could become a mid teen share of our total business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess Gerald or Rick, if we could just go right into the cash flow, again a second quarter here of decent year-over-year improvement (14:40) to kind of structural improvements to the working capital. Maybe if you could elaborate on that. And then as we think of moving to the back half cadence, I just want to discuss that and then the bridge to that $1 billion kind of build in 2019, if you are able to provide some color there, that would be great.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Eric, this is Rick. Let me just remind everybody. First, what we talked about at the beginning of the year which was around the first quarter call, which was we have two objectives this year for cash flow from operations. One is to level it out, so that we don't have quite the \u2013 so we're not as back-end loaded as we have historically been, although that gives us a lot more flexibility with respect to how we deploy our capital during the course of the year. And the second thing is to drive structural improvement in working capital.","So, how are we doing that? The focus is really on receivables, inventory and accounts payable. And where you're really seeing through the first half, where you're really seeing the benefit is coming from inventory reductions. You probably saw that our inventory was down. It was basically flat, but down about 7% on the core. So, we are seeing good improvement in our inventory. That's continuing to be a shining spot and our days to pay and our payables is moving up very nicely and so those two things are providing a good base for the performance of cash flow in the first half. We expect those things to continue and we expect to see in the second half some additional benefits from accounts receivable as well.","So, that's what's really driving it. Part of what we're doing is timing related to balancing things out, but the part is actually true, structural improvement to the working capital. And as a result, we feel really good about our cash flow guidance for this year and we're right on track to get where we want to get to and very, very excited about it.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just follow-up in terms of profitability and margins, the back half of this year you start to lap the kind of acquisition contribution, how we think about \u2013 should it be sort of an inflection in organic growth helping kind of leverage the fixed cost, but maybe just sort of talk through the margin components, be at the savings from Project Booster really gives you kind of confidence in the improved profitability.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hello?","Operator","Please standby, the conference will resume momentarily. And please continue to standby. The conference will resume momentarily. Thank you. You may resume. Eric Tracy, your line is open still.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sorry about that, Eric. Don't take it personally, Eric. We're not trying to avoid you. Now, let me talk a little about margins. First of all, I think we tried to be very clear in our remarks and that the fact that we think that consensus estimates for the back half are right in line with our expectations. So, I think you can kind of take that as a guide for margins, that does imply margin improvement in the back half. Yes, we are overlapping our acquisitions and so, you won't see quite as large a margin improvement on the gross margin line going forward in the back half as you did in the front halves of the year, that's to be expected. We do expect to see operating margin up in the back half as well.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a nice quarter in a tough environment. So, I guess, just to Eric's question about Booster, so it looks like you'll get about $15 million of SG&A back in the first half of next year. But just kind of curious on top of that, of the $100 million run rate in cost benefits that you're planning by 2019, how should we think about that kind of getting layered into 2018, just trying to think about the build over the next two years?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, in terms of \u2013 let me be clear, the $15 million of expenses we've seen in the first half will come back to us in savings in the second half of this year, so it will be neutral for the full year. Then you'll begin to see the net $100 million; remember, $150 million of total savings and the rest is about $50 million of the business over that two-year period of 2018 and 2019. Typically you would see the SG&A savings come a little earlier, and the cost to sales savings coming a little bit more in the back end of that period. We haven't given any specific numbers for 2018 and 2019 yet, but we will as we start giving guidance for 2018 later this year.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess at a high level, just curious, so you were looking for organic growth to inflect in the back half, but just if you were to see a sustained negative top-line environment for the next year, so can you just talk about the sustainability of your core margins within the business, just trying to think about how would you think about the ability to match capacity with volume if units were negative for another again 12 months to 24 months?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Ike, I kind of hate to be negative about it, but let me just remind everybody of what drives our margin improvement. It's driven by things like synergies. We're going to get those regardless. It's driven by manufacturing savings. Those have been \u2013 you don't set your watch by the amount and quality of the manufacturing savings that we've gotten in the past. And so, SG&A leverage, those are the kinds of things that have driven our margin improvement consistently over time. And in fact, during periods when we have seen a challenging top line with respect to organic. So, I think, we've proven that we certainly can expand margins in both a growing and challenging environment. So, again, it gets back to why those margins get improved.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","And this is Gerald. I would just add to that, that as we've said many times from our manufacturing standpoint, we always maintain around 20% of our production outside of our network and flexible capacity, which gives us the ability to flex up or down and offset any short-term impact we may have in volume now. I don't want to end the question this way, because I want to turn back to what we've talked about is, we are off to a really solid start here, all the trends that we set out to achieve and the sequential improvement we were expecting in our business, we're seeing and we see all the momentum now occurring into the second half and the year is playing out exactly as we expected it would, it will return to organic growth in the second half as Rick noted in this comments. And we think it will grow at about 2.5% rate in each of those quarters.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us a little color on your comment that your guidance includes some more store closures and just curious what prompts you to say that and how did you try to go about estimating that as you look out your business for the next six months?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No. Our guidance has always been, Michael, that we expected in the first half of the year that there would be headwinds from the store closures and also a continued maintenance of tight inventory by our retailers in the U.S. market in particular. The store closure is more heavily in the first quarter and continued constraint of inventory into Q2, and that's the ramp thing that we anticipated, particularly as it affected our Innerwear business and that's why we expected that we'd see the sequential improvement that we are seeing.","And it's broad-based when you look at our Innerwear business. We saw it across our basics business as we drove volume improvement as well as share improvement. We saw an improvement in trends in our intimates business as well that along with our online trends give us great confidence that we'll return to growth in the second half.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on that, your comment that you're expecting the holiday build, I think, the back-to-school and holiday build to be lower than last year kind of adds a little layer of conservatism to the guidance. But are you seeing that dynamic ahead of key shopping dates in the first half? Am I right to assume that you've seen the retailers building a little lower. And have you seen if their starting point is a little lower or are you seeing them start to chase or maybe your thoughts on how inventories look in the channel today?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, our inventories in the channel, I think, are well aligned, and that's due to the cautious approach that our retailers have taken to inventory management. As part of that, they are tending to bring their inventory in closer to the event and they are more cautions in the builds that they make. And so that is the reason for our approach, our cautious approach, particularly in the fourth quarter. As we look at what's played out over the last couple of years, we think it's prudent to approach with caution.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And then if I could just ask one last one. I know there's a lot of moving parts on the organic growth. I think it came in a little bit lower than you thought in the second quarter. You pointed out a shift. That seems to explain it. If we think about the moving parts of the catalog and lapping a destock last year in the second half, if you were to exclude that list of one-time issues that you have been helping us with, is there a sense that the organic growth rate will be positive in the second half?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, yes, the guidance that we've given calls for 2.5% of organic growth in Q3, and as I said in my remarks, I'm expecting 2.5% organic growth in Q4 as well.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It seems business is playing out very much as you had planned. With the in line results and guidance, maybe the best use of my question is to ask you to talk a little bit about trends and opportunities you're seeing with Hanes Europe and also Hanes Australasia.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. Let me take that. We're seeing solid performance out of Hanes Europe starting with them. They've done a great job over the last several years now of executing their integration plan. It's gone very well and the synergies are coming through just as we expected. So I can't say anything, but positive things about them.","From the standpoint of their operating margins, they have been in double-digit operating margin for a number of quarters now, which really is playing out to the strength of our integration of the Hanes Europe business. From the Champion Europe business, that's also going well. That integration is fully in motion now. We'll see the vast majority of those synergies really play out in 2018 as they're supply chain driven, but the business itself is performing very well and it continues to perform at that mid-single digit kind of growth rate that we had said that that acquisition would deliver.","If I look to Australia, it's very much the same story. That's a business that's a combination of wholesale and omni-channel. It too is continuing to grow at that mid-single digit rate that we expected, driven by its omni-channel business in particular. And there again the integration is going extremely well, the management team is executing well, and we anticipate again to see those synergies well into 2018 as they too are also heavily supply chain driven.","So we feel really good about those acquisitions. And just as a reminder that goes into the base as we look into second half and helps drive that accelerated organic growth as we look to the second half.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good to hear. And then you're getting a little bit of relief on FX. Rick, are you working with the same FX assumptions in the guidance? Just being conservative and not passing that through, or is there an update on that?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. As we look at the guidance for the back half, we have not assumed any material changes in FX rates in the back half. That's probably a little conservative because I've been doing this a long time and I've learned never to bet on FX rates. But even if we do see these rates stay at the current levels that they're at, they're really going to have a fairly minimal impact on our full year. You're talking about a 20, 30 basis point impact on revenue growth for the full year, and really almost immaterial impact on operating profit. So I guess the bottom line is that FX rates shouldn't be a major player in the back half of the year for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys, and also congrats on navigating the environment.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","We had a couple of questions. On Champion up 7% I think globally, it's been up double digits for a few quarters now. Should we expect the brand to revert back to double digits again in the back half? Maybe talk about the new distribution opportunity there as opposed to productivity improvements. And then secondly, just a follow-up on the synergies. What was the amount you realized in the second quarter? And I think you should have about $85 million less between 2018 and 2019. How should we think about the number for 2018?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Let me take the first half of that question, then we'll go to the synergies. From the standpoint of Global Champion, we did see it have another solid quarter of growth in that 7% rate. We expect Champion globally to continue to grow in that high single-digit rate as we go through the balance of the year. We've got a nice base with our retail stores now, particularly in Champion Europe and our omni-channel push here is also having pretty dramatic impact on sales. As I mentioned in some of my comments, we're seeing strong double-digit rate growth of online in our Champion business, in particular in many of our markets. So that is a positive trend for us as well. And so as we look to the balance of the year, it's that combination of driving the online, but also we do expect some broadened distribution in the second half of the year on the core Champion business as well.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. With respect to synergies, we saw $6 million of synergies in Q2, which brings us to $11 million for the year-to-date, right on pace for where we thought we'd be. And you're right, I'm impressed, Anna, that you remember it was $85 million. That's right. That's what we are expecting for 2018 and 2019, though we haven't given any specific guidance on exactly how that $85 million will roll out. We do expect that it will roll out between 2018 and 2019, and we'll give you more visibility on that as we give guidance for 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Marotta with C.L. King & Associates.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good evening, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about the current costing environment and if there has been any changes, either favorably or unfavorably, since the last time you spoke? And even if this bleeds a little bit into commentary regarding those deltas in 2018 that might be helpful.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well. I think, Steve, I think in general in terms of our cost structure, things have \u2013 never really seen any big surprises this year. Cotton continues to be somewhat volatile. It was up earlier in the year. It's now back down. Again, it's kind of operating in a normal band that we would expect. And we've always said, as long as it does that, then we're fine with that. We're hedged on cotton through about mid-year of next year, and so we got good visibility for the back half of this year and the front half of next year. And then again costs in general, labor costs, other inputs are really unfolding right along with our plan, no surprises.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. And I would only add to that, Steve, a critical part of our Project Booster though is over the next few years to drive $150 million of cost savings by leveraging our scale and our infrastructure, building toward that run rate to the end of 2019. And that will be both SG&A and cost of goods savings, and $50 million of that we will invest back in the business. But we have a very tight focus on driving cost down.","Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. And I think, Rick, you mentioned \u2013 or maybe it was Gerald \u2013 that the current point of sale, pace of sales is matching your shipments largely. There's no inventory stocking or destocking that is material or germane at this point, right. That's correct?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","No, yeah, what we feel is that the retailers have managed inventories tightly and inventory is in line with where it should be at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","I wanted to ask you \u2013 thanks guys \u2013 I wanted to ask you about the acquisition environment. We've been hearing from some other players out there. There's obviously been some activity in the sector. And we're hearing from other players that it's loosening up a bit. Valuations are becoming a bit more attractive. I know you're a year out or so from your last one. Is it time to start thinking about something? Can you kind of corroborate that's a fair assessment of what the environment's like?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","What I would say is, yes, acquisitions have and remain an important part of our strategy, Omar. And we've driven a substantial returns for our shareholders with those acquisitions. We did say in the first half of the year that we would focus on integrating the two that we had made, Pacific Brands and Champion Europe, and you're exactly right, it's been a year since we made those acquisitions. Those integrations are well underway, and our cash flow is building nicely. And we do think there is \u2013 we always have a long list of potentials that we're out talking to, and we're clearly positioned when the time is right to make an acquisition. And when we have a deal, we'll definitely let you guys know, but it's an important part of our strategy going forward.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Fabulous. That's all I wanted to know. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","Great, thanks. Hey, guys. Can you talk through where you see the state of Champion growth, just given all the noise around the athletic channels, the retail? So where you see the growth happening from that distribution? And then just with the destockings or some of destockings behind us, can you give us some context on what you see for how long it normally it takes for orders to normalize afterwards and then just comfort that the retailers are where you think they should be? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of Champion, I think that our Champion growth is going to certainly come on a global basis. We've got many tools now as we've linked the business back together on a global basis, and we anticipate driving it. Certainly in Europe we have high expectations as we bring Champion Europe into the fold. Within this market we're seeing particularly strong growth online driving our Champion business as well as we do see some distribution expansion opportunities in our core brand that we anticipate.","And then finally, as Rick noted in his comments, we've seen very strong growth in our Asia business and continue to do so. So we really do see that we have a lots of growth levers in the Champion business going forward. And so we feel that the activewear category is still a nice growth category, and we think we've got room to grow on a global basis.","From the standpoint of destocking, going through this half of the year, we've certainly seen cautious inventory management rather than I would say destocking. The period of rebuild that we would say that won't repeat itself because as we get out to the fourth quarter, we don't anticipate an additional destocking as we went through last year. We think that's all worked through. We certainly have been cautious about anticipating holiday builds, and we haven't planned them in the fourth quarter, but we had not expected an additional destocking given the tight nature of the inventory. In fact, if you look at our half, we've taken a balanced approach in the second half anticipating roughly a 2.5% growth between each of the quarters.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Rick, the guidance suggests that from the special charges that you outlined in 3Q, the 4Q special charges will be somewhere in the zero to $10 million range. Is that a signal that the special charges, assuming no other deals obviously, are starting to recede or maybe there's some of that work being pushed out into the first quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2018?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, the answer to actually both of your questions is yes. I think it does signal too that we are seeing a continued decline in the special charges as we continue to work through these acquisition integrations. You will see it pick up a little bit in 2018, but 2018's XA charges should be well below this year's $80 million to $90 million, and we'll be done with XA charges related to our current acquisitions by the end of 2019. So it will continue to trail off through 2019 to eventually zero.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then if I can ask you just about the Innerwear segment, and if you could just walk us through some of the puts and takes in Innerwear gross margin and SG&A and just how the year-over-year change in operating profit percentage of total sales played out that'd be super helpful.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, let me say this about the margin decline in Innerwear. It was actually something that we had expected to see happen. As I said in my remarks, it was driven by a couple of things: one is lower sales, which kind of implies a little bit of a mix issue that we think will ride itself as we go through the balance of the year. Project Booster expenses impacted that particular business. I think that a lot of the things that hit the Innerwear business are pretty transitory. I'm not really worried about those margins. They're very strong and have a good long track record of increasing over time and I don't see any integral change in that in the near-term.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan With Cowen and Company.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to go to Project Booster. I think you laid out $300 million in operating cash flow improvement potential by 2019. Just want to go back to your confidence in that because obviously it implies a pretty significant jump in cash flow from operations from where you are now, pretty substantial. So just want you to talk through, kind of, your confidence in those targets from Project Booster and the timing of it for fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, I think as we look at the components of it, we've talked about a lot of them, the key drivers being first of all continued improved profitability always helps for cash flow. We're continuing to drive our inventory turns more positively, and so as we continue \u2013 we aren't done yet by any stretch in terms of where we are and we made great progress the last year or so. But we continue to remain highly focused on that.","We've begun to make really good progress in extending terms with our suppliers. We are I would say in the early stages there. We got a lot of runway left on that to get, and over time we expect to see some nice improvements in our accounts receivables. So, again, I take all the structural components of working capital, and we see where that's going and we add to that nice profitability improvement over time, and that gets us to our expectations on cash flow from operations.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah. At the highest level it's roughly $200 million in our working capital improvement, $100 million in cost savings through the Project Booster is how it comes together.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, thanks. Final question is on the 2.5% organic growth in the back half of the year. Can you just give us a breakdown that we should expect from Innerwear, Activewear and International?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we don't generally give guidance by segment on those sorts of things. But I think Gerald outlined for you what the drivers are without necessarily giving you the exact numbers for each one. I mean, our International business is continuing to grow nicely and those acquisitions as they overlap has been growing in the mid single-digits.","And so we expect that to continue, so we'll see that driving our numbers, we're seeing sequential improvement in our Innerwear business and all the signs that we see suggest that that sequential improvement is going to continue in the back half. The Activewear business had a couple of temporary kerfuffles in the quarter, but that's globally a strong driver. And Gerald talked about online as being I think 25% growth in that. So we've got a lot of great momentum going in a lot of different areas of our business. And so we're very excited about the back half of the year and the opportunities for us. So I can't give you the exact numbers for each one, but I think we've got enough there to get you 2.5%.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Pallavi Bakshi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, this is Pallavi Bakshi on for Christian. We were wondering if you could talk a little bit about innovation. We've been seeing a lot of it in our mass channel checks. What can we expect for back-to-school or the second half as far as the product pipeline? And then secondly, should we expect any changes in the mix within Innerwear basics versus premium? Thank you.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of innovation, one of our key drivers for the momentum in our basics as we look to the back half of the year through both back-to-school and in holidays are FreshIQ initiatives. We're continuing to drive behind that, we're seeing great results. As I mentioned, our share is building in basics, on a broad basis in socks as well as underwear and kids underwear. FreshIQ is the key initiative there, but also our X-Temp innovation continues to drive growth, in fact our ComfortBlend and X-Temp innovations together now represent roughly 18% of our basics business so we're continuing to see growth there.","And the great thing about these innovations is we're now driving them across the globe. So X-Temp is now being sold in France as well and we're beginning to use some of our bra innovations in Australia. So we really see that we have a lot of bandwidth to keep driving these innovations as we go through the back of the year. And certainly that drives some growth in the category when we drive that and many times these are premium innovations that help our retailers as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. My first question is just about ASPs and its contributions to sales during the quarter and how should we think about it when organic growth inflects in the second half?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, from the standpoint of ASP, that's a question that runs across many criteria, but if I look at it this way from the standpoint of our pricing has been in place for all the years. So what we're really driving is, is organic growth based on a combination of really unit growth. We're driving our business and it's going to be driven by unit growth on prices that have been in place. We see solid increases in volume across the businesses, just as the earlier question asked, where is your organic growth coming from, it's coming in all of our businesses in the second half from the standpoint of Innerwear, Activewear and International businesses. So, you would see your average sales price moving with the unit growth.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And my second question is, we've heard concern before about how a business that's selling more maybe commoditized product will translate online, and just based on the sales growth rates we heard today, that doesn't seem to be a problem. So, our question is what are you doing digitally to resonate with the consumer? And do you think you're acquiring new customers that you haven't sold to before online?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","First of all, I think brands matter online just like they matter at retail. And when you can pair brands that consumers know with meaningful innovation, they're equally as interested in buying online as they are at retail. And we've now paired that with our digital media and reaching particularly the millennial consumer where they're increasingly gathering their information and that's in the digital world.","What I would tell you is, we see consumers go back and forth, so being able to lever our brands and our product across channels is an important part of this mix. We don't see consumers that are uniquely tied to one channel or the other. Millennials are equally interested in shopping at retail. So, we really believe having a breadth of distribution tied to strong brands is the key to our success. And as you noted, we're having a lot of success. We're seeing growing and strong growth rates online.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of William Schultz with Goldman Sachs.","Bill Schultz - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gerald, last quarter you sort of alluded to, I guess, like a structural dynamic that's playing out in your wholesale business which is online wholesale. As online wholesale sort of outpaces offline wholesale, you kind of see some inventory dynamics at play because of the different inventory turnover of those channels. I am curious if you've sort of quantified the impact of that dynamic to your business, especially in the context of really healthy growth in online wholesale that you guys have been reporting?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we do know that there is somewhat of an offset when a door closes and the consumer buys the merchandise in that store that they have to go through a purchase cycle before they come back into the market and a number of those purchases are now online. So you go through the purchase in one and then they have to come back online or wherever their choice of purchase is for years. So generally look at our categories. We know that per capita consumption over time is consistent, and we would expect it to normalize within a year's period roughly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I'm wondering, can you give a little more color on the back-to-school shift, was it specific to channel or certain products?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, no really, it was just that we are seeing our retailers increasingly make their purchases closer to the event and so we had anticipated in our last call that we would see some movement of orders from Q2 into Q3 and certainly that's what we see play out. I will remind you that back-to-school itself as a period has also elongated. So while it now begins in late July, it tends to run through late September even into early October. So we're just in the early phases of that and it will go on for a while, but we did see some of the initial shipments moved from second to the third quarter.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And is it cross channel, like the mass as well as department stores, are you seeing it pronounced more in any one channel?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I'm not seeing it pronounced more in one channel than another, no.","Carla Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","William Michael Reuter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon. I just have one. I know you guys have laid out a leverage target of 2 to 3 times. But I'm not sure if you've laid out in the event that you guys were to make a larger acquisition, what the maximum leverage you would push up for the right acquisition would be. Have you guys laid out that number?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Bill, we haven't really given a specific number. I think in our history, we've had leverage much higher than what it is today and been very comfortable with that. Not to say that we would want to go back to those days. But I think a lot depends on the acquisition itself, what we think the synergies are, how quickly can we get the synergies, how quickly can we repay the debt and get back down to 2 to 3 times leverage ratio. So we take all of that into account in terms of \u2013 and obviously, our bank covenants as well, we take all that into account in terms of how far afield from the 3 times we would go.","William Michael Reuter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just another one from me. I feel like a lot of \u2013 I am hearing from a lot of apparel companies, such as yourselves that department stores are emphasizing brand, but then I also read articles about companies trying to expand their private label offerings. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing or hearing from your customers in terms of their interest in expanding private label?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Look, in our categories there's always been an element of private label but brands have always resonated very strongly. And if you look at a core category like underwear, it's been 80% plus branded for years. And in good times and bad times that number really doesn't move and in fact if anything, brands gain a little during tough times. So from the standpoint, we're not seeing any significant pressure on any of our business. We feel good about where our brands and our programs are positioned and we expect to continue to grow them.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

For today' call, Gerald and Barry will provide some brief remarks, and then, we'll open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thank you, T.C. We had a very strong quarter. Our business momentum continued to build as our first quarter results exceeded expectations for revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Our strong start to the year puts us firmly on pace to achieve our full year outlook. And we remain on track to deliver on the goals we laid out at last year's Investor Day.","For the quarter, organic constant currency revenue increased 10% over last year, while reported revenue grew 8%. Our growth was broad-based across businesses and geographies, a clear indication that our diversification strategy and growth related investments are delivering their intended results. On an organic constant-currency basis, international sales were up over 18%. Activewear revenue increased 17%, consumer directed revenue, which we define as our branded stores and all online channels, was up 16%. And global Champion growth, excluding C9, accelerated to 75%.","Looking further at the quarter's organic constant currency performance, in each region of our global Innerwear business, we delivered sales and operating profit that were above or in line with our forecast. International Innerwear sales were up over last year, with growth in Asia, Australia and the Americas, more than offsetting the expected decline in Europe. We are encouraged by the performance of our U.S. Innerwear business in the quarter, while our revenue was down compared to last year, we were pleased that both sales and operating profit were above our expectations. The upside was driven in part by a better than expected net benefit from pricing.","We also saw continued strong performance from our innovation platforms including Comfort Flex Fit and Hanes and Cool Comfort and Maidenform. In addition, Hanes displaced to private label sock program at a national value retail. This reinforces the view that brands remain the number one driver of consumer purchase intent in our categories. We are committed to returning our US Innerwear business to long-term growth with specific actions in 2019, that include increased marketing investments, particularly within Intimates, as well as the launch of additional innovations.","Touching on Champion, we continue to experience strong consumer demand for the brand around the world. In the quarter, excluding C9, we saw double-digit growth across our wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels in each of our main geographies. We are also seeing strong consumer engagement with the brand in Australia, as we leverage our in-country operations to broaden Champion's distribution in that market. The success of Champion over the past several years is a result of our highly coordinated global strategy to elevate the brand after it was reunited in 2016. Our broad strategy integrates design globally. We're optimizing our supply chain and distribution operations for improved efficiency and service. The brand is engaging directly with consumers, particularly millennials across various digital platforms, with both regional and global campaign. And our strategy involves a detailed segmentation plan to drive differentiation between channels. This plan allows us to expand our distribution without over extending the brand.","In wholesale, we are working with our retail partners to offer the right mix of product to their specific customer base and within our direct-to-consumer platform, we're continuing our online efforts while developing a network of branded stores, particularly in Asia. We believe Champion has a long runway for growth and we remain ahead of pace on our 2022 sales goal of $2 billion.","At our Investor Day last year, we spoke about our efforts over the past several years to strengthen our business model by diversifying our revenue base and honing our operations to fully leverage our global scale, all with a focus on delivering more consistent organic growth and unlocking our full cash flow potential. We're seeing the benefits from our efforts reflected in our results, as well as in our 2019 outlook. We've grown our organic constant currency revenue for seven straight quarters and we expect organic growth to continue as we increase our brand related investments. We're leveraging our global scale and we're streamlining our supply chain to further lower cost and increase our speed to market. This should generate margin expansion this year, even with our increased investments to drive future growth.","We are also on track to accelerate operating cash flow growth this year as our outlook reflects 17% growth at the mid-point. And as we generate higher levels of cash flow, we believe we are well positioned to accelerate value creation to our shareholders over the next several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.","Barry Hytinen","Thanks, Gerald. Overall, we delivered strong first quarter results, as we exceeded our expectations across all of our key metrics, including sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. For the quarter, sales were $1.59 billion, an increase of $117 million over last year. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% over last year to $169 million. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.27 and $0.22, respectively. And cash flow from operations was a use of $194 million.","With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 8% over last year, including $18 million from acquisition contributions and a $46 million headwind from foreign exchange. With the relatively stronger US dollar, currency was a greater headwind as compared to our guidance. Organic constant currency sales were strong in the quarter, up 10% over last year.","Adjusted gross margin of 40.2% increased 10 basis points over prior year, in line with our outlook. The increase was driven by improved gross margin in our US Activewear and Innerwear segment, as well as the non-organic contribution from Bras N Things. Partially offsetting this was the impact from the stronger US dollar. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $169 million, which included $6 million of currency headwinds as compared to last year. Versus the mid-point of our guidance, this was $7 million higher on a reported basis and $9 million higher on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted operating margin of 10.7% reflected our planned investments to support future growth initiatives, an increase in variable compensation accruals, as well as an unexpected bad debt charge of $4 million for a single customer in the printwear channel. Absent the bad debt charge, adjusted operating margin would have been 10.9% and earnings per share would have been about $0.01 higher.","For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges of $21 million were essentially in line with our guidance, as was our tax rate of 14%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% from $0.26 to $0.27, while GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 was consistent with last year.","Now, let me take you through our segment performance. US Innerwear sales were down 3% compared to last year, while operating margin increased 130 basis points to 22%. Basics revenue increased 1.5%, our second straight quarter of low single-digit growth. Intimate sales declined 12% in the quarter, in line with our expectation. Bra sales were lower as planned, while our shapewear revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter. Shapewear's growth was driven by continued positive consumer reception to our new product designs and Cool Comfort innovation.","US Activewear's performance was very strong in the quarter, with sales up 17% and profit up 14% over last year. Excluding C9, Champion Activewear sales increased more than 80%. The growth was driven by strong comps and space expansions at existing accounts, new distribution, including the sporting goods channel, as well as growth in our consumer directed channels. Champion's growth more than offset the expected declines in our remaining Activewear businesses including C9. Activewear's operating margin declined 30 basis points to 10.8%. We incurred higher levels of expediting costs in order to keep up with the strong Champion demand. We also further increased our investments to support growth.","In our International segment, sales increased 13%, or $76 million. This included a non-organic contribution of $18 million from Bras N Things and a $46 million headwind from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On an organic constant currency basis, sales increased 18%, or $104 million, compared to last year. We grew across all of our International regions, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas and exceeded our expectations in both our Innerwear and Activewear businesses during the quarter. International's operating margin increased 80 basis points over last year to 14.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which International's operating margin was above the corporate average as we are benefiting from volume-driven leverage and acquisition synergies.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, consistent with our normal seasonality, cash flow from operations was a use in the quarter, though we used less cash than planned, thanks to higher net income and a stronger working capital performance. For the quarter, our cash cycle improved by 5 days as compared to last year. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.5 times, down meaningfully from last year's 3.9 times. We remain on track to bring our leverage down to 2.9 times by the end of the year.","And now turning to guidance; we reiterated our full year 2019 guidance, so I'll point you to our press release and FAQ document for more details. I would like to share a couple of points to characterize our full-year outlook. We're pleased with our strong first quarter results and the momentum we're seeing in the business. That said, it's early in the year and we remain cautious with respect to our outlook, including the US retail environment and the strengthening US dollar. Our full year guidance now includes currency headwind of $115 million in revenue and $17 million in operating profit, which is higher than our previous outlook by $55 million and $10 million, respectively. In effect this incremental FX headwind has been fully offset by the $9 million of outperformance in our first quarter operating profit.","We also issued second quarter guidance, which at the mid-point implies total sales growth of approximately 2% and constant currency sales growth of approximately 4%. Our guidance reflects nearly $40 million of currency headwind in the second quarter, which is approximately $15 million higher than our prior outlook. I'll note that reported and organic sales are the same this quarter as we anniversaried our Bras N Things acquisitions last quarter.","With respect to our segments, the mid-point of our second quarter revenue guidance assumes a 2% decline in our US Innerwear segment. This is unchanged from our prior outlook and reflects our continued cautious stance as it relate to door closings in the mid-tier and department store channels. In US Activewear, the mid-point of our second quarter guidance assumes revenue growth of approximately 11%. This outlook reflects strong double-digit growth in Champion, excluding C9, and also reflects a mid-single-digit decline in the rest of our Activewear segment. In our International segment, the mid-point of our guidance assumes reported sales growth approaching 1% and constant currency sales growth of approximately 7.5%. Our constant currency outlook for the quarter and the remainder of the year is unchanged from our prior outlook. And as we said last quarter, this may prove to be conservative, given the strong trends we're seeing in Champion.","Our second quarter operating profit range is $238 million to $248 million. Our guidance reflects the incremental currency headwinds I mentioned earlier, as well as an acceleration within the year of our growth-related investments, including brand support for Champion and US Intimates. I'll note that our full year expectation of a $25 million increase in growth-related investments over last year remains unchanged. We expect interest and other expense of approximately $56 million and a tax rate of approximately 14%. Our second quarter guidance assumes diluted shares outstanding of slightly more than $365 million and approximately $15 million of acquisition, integration and supply chain related charges. Our full year outlook for $55 million of charges is unchanged. Therefore, at the mid-point, our second quarter adjusted net income guidance is approximately $161 million and our adjusted and GAAP earnings per share are $0.44 and $0.41, respectively.","So in closing, we had a strong first quarter. Our diversification efforts are working and our business momentum continues to build. We are on pace to achieve our full year outlook and we remain on track to generate higher levels of operating cash flow.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard","Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Thanks guys for taking my question. Really just wanted to follow up on Champion, that ex-mass number is pretty significant acceleration. I mean the brand has obviously got tremendous demand globally and you guys are doing, from what we can tell, a really nice job segmenting the product, layering in new products. But maybe you could talk about, especially in the context of C9 business going away, holistically where you see this brand going, are there any plans for a mass channel segmented brand piece? And then where you see the higher-end of the brand, how big can that business be and given where its current strength is on a global basis? Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Thanks, Omar, for the question. This is Gerald. First of all, I'd like to just comment, we're very proud of the quarter. We think we had a really strong quarter and it exceeded our expectations from a revenue, operating profit and earnings per share basis. And from an operating cash flow, we're ahead of plan and certainly well on track to get back within our leverage range. Our diversification and brand investment strategy is really showing through, as it was broad-based growth, it wasn't just a Champion event. We saw it across our international business, both in Innerwear as well as our Activewear business and our Consumer Direct business continues to grow and we're also very pleased that our US Innerwear business performed better than our expectations in the quarter.","Now, certainly, to your question, Champion, also had a very strong quarter, up 75% excluding C9 on a constant currency basis. We are delighted with this growth, we are delighted with what the management team is doing with the brand. And it was broad based growth. It was across regions, it was double-digit in both wholesale and consumer. And we're really seeing the benefit of our activities, that we're segmenting the business and it's driving additional growth opportunities where we are and it's opening up additional growth opportunities in new customers. And as we commented, the sporting goods channel, for example, is now growing nicely for us as well.","And we are seeing it on a global basis, not only in the markets we're in, but we see expansion opportunities in Asia, for example, and other European countries. So we see a lot of road ahead to build this business and we're investing in the business as well. We continue to drive our digital campaigns, and in our 100th anniversary, we're driving our global campaign to connect with that millennial consumer. We feel really good about the momentum. We continue to believe we'll grow at a 30% rate this year and continue to drive a high teen's growth rate in the second half in spite of overlap and some really strong comps, from last year. So we're well ahead of pace on our $2 billion goal for 2022 at this point in time.","And so, where we see ourselves now is that, we have the opportunity to continuing to deliver that goal first, but we are beginning to lay internal goals to take us beyond that $2 billion goal in the years ahead. We've got a lot of momentum and lot of room to run here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B Riley, FBR. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, this is Luke Hatton [ph] on for Susan. Nice job on the quarter. Can you dig into the details around the Innerwear beat versus your original guidance? And then, also, how you're thinking about the next steps in the Innerwear revitalization initiative sort of for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Gerald Evans","Sure. Let me take that and I'll let Barry comment on the backside of the -- on the elements side of it. But let me just say, first, we're delighted with the Innerwear performance in the quarter. It was better than our expectations from both an operating profit and a sales standpoint. And there were a lot of encouraging signs in the quarter. Our price increases went in place and we saw better-than-expected flow-through from those price increases in the quarter. Our Basics business was up for a second consecutive quarter at a low single digit rate and we're now putting our expanded space in place including the sock space that we commented in our prepared comments.","Our Intimates business also performed to expectations in the quarter for the second quarter in a row and we're seeing real traction out of our early initiatives to revitalize that business and that was our shapewear business, where we've seen now three quarters in a row of solid growth behind our cooling innovation. So, we feel good about where we were in the quarter and we've got a lot coming for the balance of the year. We're ramping up our investments with particular focus on the Intimates business, we've got a really strong back-to-school program planned for our Basics business, and we've got a number of innovations coming up across both our Basics business as well as our bra and shapewear business.","So we feel good about where we're going with this business. We feel that we're heading in the right direction and we expect that we're well on pace we think to return it to consistent growth over time. Barry, you want to comment on the details of the quarter?","Barry Hytinen","I think the only thing I would add is, relates to specifically on Innerwear, as we go forward, for the second quarter, we are planning it down as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, down 2%. That's totally unchanged from our prior outlook and it's just us remaining prudent as it relates to the retail environment. We feel good, as Gerald was mentioning, about how things play out, Basics being up and Intimates being in line and strong growth in shapewear. So we feel good about how Innerwear performed and appreciate the question. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Barry, on last calls I think you called out that US Champion outside the mass should grow at a high 20 percentage rate for FY '19. I think based on the guidance for total US Activewear of up 4% for the year, should we assume US Champion outside the mass grows closer to 40% for the year? Maybe talk a little bit about the cadence by quarter, and then I have a follow-up question on C9, if I may.","Barry Hytinen","A few thoughts there Laurent. Thanks for the question. We certainly are seeing or saw a very strong out performance as compared to even our guidance for Champion around the world in the first quarter. And if I take that upper level, first, I would say, our global Champion sales outlook now, excluding C9, would be around $1.8 billion in constant currency and that's kind of a low 30%s growth rate, which is up from our prior outlook of high 20%s, and really just reflects the fact that we outperformed in the first quarter. We, obviously, see a really long runway for growth in Champion globally. And as Gerald mentioned, we are running ahead of our goals.","As it relates to within US Activewear, I would say, it does imply an improvement in terms of the rate of growth for the full year, but once again, all we've done, Laurent, is roll forward the improvement in our first quarter performance. So we have Champion, excluding C9, up on a percentage basis in the low 30%s range versus our prior guidance of 20%s, as I mentioned, and that represents about $200 million of growth within US Activewear segment, reflecting both the better performance in the first quarter, and as I mentioned last quarter, we would expect the growth rate to naturally taper as we go through the year, as we go through larger comps. And certainly, we would still expect a double-digit growth in all quarters.","And if you think about it, I think, the back half expectations that we've got there, I'll just reiterate what I said last time, I think, it could prove conservative because frankly the business is just doing great and the team is doing a phenomenal job with Champion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Gerard [ph] on for John. Thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the other US Activewear that's not in the Champion piece of business? I believe you said planned to be down mid-single digits in the second quarter. How do you expect that to progress throughout the year and what's kind of driving that decline in Q2? Thank you.","Barry Hytinen","Sure, this is Barry. Thank you, Gerard. It's another good question. If you look at the second quarter with respect to US Activewear, maybe I'll just go through the whole thing for you. We've got it growing about 11% in our guidance, C9 and Activewear is expected to decline kind of mid to low single digits. If we call that 4%, that's about $4 million, would be about $86 million of revenue. Champion, excluding C9 I just mentioned, but in terms of the specifics on the second quarter, we would say a strong double-digit rate, probably in the 40% plus range for the quarter and that would equate to over $55 million worth of growth.","And then, the rest of US Activewear is expected to decline mid-to-high single digit rate, which would represent a decline of about $10 million in the quarter. And as we talked about before, that's the continuation of a long-term plan to migrate to higher margin products and that's one of the main drivers of seeing gross margin expansion in our Activewear business, both in the most recent quarter, and as we go through the year. So we feel very good about the way the Activewear business is trending. And I'll just note that all of those expectations I gave for the second quarter are essentially unchanged from what we gave in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole","Barry, just want to follow-up on SG&A. SG&A dollars in the quarter, maybe a little bit higher than was expected going back to the guidance in February. And then I think that, for 2Q, you're calling out a forward acceleration within the year from the second half, approximately $5 million of growth related investments. I'm assuming that's SG&A. Can you just talk about exactly or give a little bit more color, you touched on it, but more about what you're investing in and what kind of return you expect from the investment and where we should see it?","Barry Hytinen","Jay, good morning. Thanks for the questions. And I'll take the first part of that and then maybe I'll let Gerald speak some to the specifics around how we're investing. In the first quarter, you are right, we did have some incremental SG&A as compared to the original guide and makes the performance, I think, that much clear as it relates to how strong the margin performance has been. In specific, there was just a couple of three things that I would probably call out for you Jay. In Activewear, we did spend about $1 million more in brand support than we initially anticipated, so we were kind of $6.5 million, $7 million of brand support, where I think we were planning $5 million, $6 million In the initial guide.","And then we also had about $1 million for expediting costs, because frankly the Champion business is growing so fast that we needed to expedite some to keep up with demand and maintain service levels. And then as we called out, in the corporate line, we had about $4 million of bad debt for that one specific customer in the printware business that went bankrupt and we charged that fully off. And then, we also had some incremental variable compensation accruals, which would be about the same amount. I guess I should note that we stopped shipping to that customer that we took the bad debt charge in the fourth quarter. So there were no sales to the account in the quarter or in our prior guidance.","And maybe I would -- as it relates to rolling forward, for the full year on corporate costs, I'd probably use the first quarter level, excluding the two items I just mentioned as kind of a run rate and obviously corporate cost can ebb and flow some quarter-to-quarter, but that would get you kind of full year in line with where we are guiding. In the second quarter, you're right, I called out that we are going to accelerate some of the brand investment spend. Recall, on the last call, we indicated, we would spend about $25 million incremental year-on-year to support the growth of our brands and that's in things like media, marketing, distribution, etcetera, to really support that -- the fuel of the growth of not just Champion, but also our US Intimates business and some of our Innerwear brands around the world. And at that time, we said, we'd probably plan for that proportionately quarterly through the year.","We're seeing very strong ROI on those investments and exhibit would be the outperformance in sales. And so, we've chosen to bring about $5 million of that into the second quarter from the back half. So we are not increasing the level for the full year, just moving it in the year and the vast majority of that incremental $5 million that will occur in the second quarter will be in the US Activewear segment. Gerald do you want to\u2026","Gerald Evans","Just to build upon that from the standpoint of where we're spending the investment, both in the quarter and over the year, from the standpoint of the pull forward that was in Activewear and certainly from a standpoint of where we're going to spend, we are spending heavily against our Champion business. It's, obviously, growing very well, as Barry noted, is showing good returns and we're driving our 100th year anniversary celebration as part of that on a digital basis around the world and seen really good traction. The other place we're focusing heavily is in our US Innerware business, as we continue to focus on returning that business to growth. And we've added, particularly in our Intimates business this year and so, we just began for example a campaign behind Maidenform, targeted at the millennial consumer tied to influencers, and we're already seeing results of that traction in the first week that we started the campaign. So, we intend to keep driving our Innerwear business as well. And then, we are selectively spending in our International business, including Australia, to drive Innerware there as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys. This is Matt [ph] on for Ike. Congrats on the good quarter. You mentioned there was better than expected flow-through on pricing in the quarter. And I think you previously mentioned, we should see a benefit to gross margins in the back half as a result of declines in lower margin product. Can you speak to the gross margin dynamics that you're expecting to see in 2Q, and then, any updates in the back half? Thanks.","Barry Hytinen","Thanks, Matt. And thank you for the kind words about the quarter. We appreciate that. As it relates to the second quarter, on gross margin, we've got it relatively consistent year-on-year, which is a conservative outlook for sales and mix, and really not counting on much benefit from pricing on a net basis and that's consistent with the way we were thinking about it previously. And then, as it relates to the full year, you should expect gross margin for the total Company to be up, let's say, in the vicinity of 50 basis points for the full year. And as a reminder, certainly, as we move through the year, we've got more net price benefit. Certainly, in the back half, we'll have all of that and we'll have more favorable mix because, for example, we will continue the migration to higher margin products in Activewear, as I mentioned, and obviously, as Champion continues to grow, that's helpful to total mix. And so, there is a lot of good things happening in the gross margin and we have a good feel for that being up in the 50 basis point level.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Simeon Siegel","A nice start to the year. Barry, you mentioned several times -- you mentioned marketing or something along the lines today, and I think you have a fairly low marketing rate as a percent of sales at the Company level, let alone on a brand level. So just to the point about that incremental ROI and obvious customer reception you're seeing, is there -- would there be a reason to push that marketing rate up more meaningfully? And then, maybe an adjacent question. Obviously, congrats on the ongoing Champion strength. Can you just talk about how the costs to run the business are changing? So, you mentioned the margin contraction for the fulfillment. Is that a one-time or are there more recurring foundational spends that need to happen? And then, there's marketing and on the flip side other benefits you got as you scale upwards. Thanks.","T.C. Robillard","Yes, Simeon. Let me take the investment part, then I'll let Barry follow on some of the other. We definitely look at return on investment on our investment in our brands and where we see it, we will definitely spend the money to drive the business and we're certainly proving that through what we've put in place this year to drive the businesses in the focus, on both the Activewear business where you are seeing the growth and where you're also seeing the more consistent performance out of our US Innerwear. So we will spend to get the return, and I think we feel there's opportunity, we'll take advantage of it.","Barry Hytinen","And Simeon, I would say, as it relates on the distribution side and fulfillment, the $1 million I called out in the quarter was really one-time in nature, but in that $25 million that we talked about earlier on the call and last quarter as well, there's a small amount there for distribution as we continue to build out our network to fulfill what is increasingly high levels of consumer demand for things like Champion. So, yes, there is some there, but I would say that after this year, we feel good about where we are in terms of relative level of spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Your Line is now open.","Tiffany Kanaga","Thanks for taking our questions. I know you touched on it as part of your Innerwear commentary, but in light of your competitor discussing good momentum and [indiscernible] their private label men's underwear program yesterday. Would you provide some additional color on your men's underwear business in terms of market share trends and how performance might vary by channel and what you're most excited about in the innovation pipeline?","Gerald Evans","Yes. We continue to be very excited about our men's underwear business, it continues to perform very well and you can see that in the performance of our Basics, in total it was up in the quarter and certainly underwear is a key part of that. Our shares build nicely in the most recent rolling three-month period, as we see broad growth in that business. As we look at our branded business, we continue to feel brands matter, the research and the numbers consistently say that, and it's hard to dispute the facts and in the case of the numbers, they suggest that brands in Innerwear generally hold an 80% to 90% share of the market and have consistently done so over time. And as we look at brands in the US, for example, that share has actually grown over the last 12 months. And we know why, because consumers -- the key purchase driver is brands and price is a distant affair. So we continue to feel great about our underwear business and we continue to feel great about our brands in general. We've got some great innovations. Our Comfort Flex Fit innovation has worked very effectively in our underwear business and in fact, we're going to be pushing it in the back half of the year into our women's underwear business as well.","And we're getting ready to upgrade our X-Temp to an X-Temp 2.0, which works even faster in cooling the consumers. So our Innovate to Elevate continues to be an important part of our underwear business and we're continuing to drive that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Heather Balsky","Question on working capital and then excess cash. So, first, can you just update us on your initiatives on working capital and the progress you've made? And then, also, can you just talk about your long-term priorities for free cash? One, you've got your leverage target rate, it sounds like you're pretty confident [indiscernible] you're pretty close by the end of this year. And so how are you thinking about acquisitions and share repurchases? Thanks.","Barry Hytinen","This is Barry. Good morning, thanks for the questions. I'll take the first part and then I'll hand it over to Gerald. As it relates to working capital, I think the team is doing a great job here. So our cash cycle improved 5 days versus last year in the quarter. A lot of that is due to improvement in terms of payables and payables terms and obviously, you would appreciate, that's a big team effort. So we are seeing good traction there. I think we've got continued opportunity as it relates to inventory and as you move through the year, I expect inventory to be a nice source for the rest of the year. I would think about it in terms of directionally trending more like '17, as opposed to '18, when we were accelerating growth.","And then, if you think about working capital through the remainder of the year on accounts receivable, will likely be a bigger source of income than normal in light of the fact that our trajectory on sales is such that we have significant amount of sales growth in the first half and then more decelerating with the wind down of C9 as we go to the end of the year. So that is a natural incremental source of working capital benefit that you should see play out. So we feel really good about the working capital initiatives we've got underway, see a lot of opportunity over the next couple of years to continue to improve it. And Gerald, do you want to talk about the free cash?","Gerald Evans","Yes, I think from a standpoint of our long-term capital allocation strategy, it's unchanged. We are return-centric in our approach. We invest first in the business. We invest second in the dividend and we've targeted 25% to 30% payout ratio. We targeted debt, our net debt to EBITDA leverage range of 2 to 3 times. And when we're in that range, we use our free cash to repurchase shares and we use debt to make acquisitions. Now, we purposefully went outside of that range over the past several years to make acquisitions and diversify the business. I think we're certainly seeing the value of those acquisitions flow through in our results, but we also have made the decision that we want to get back in that range. So we're focused right now on using our cash to bring our leverage back into that range and we expect to be there by the end of the year, and in that 2.9 range by the end of the year and solidly back into the range as we get into 2020.","So from the standpoint of M&A, M&A has always been part of our strategy and will certainly become part of our strategy as we look forward and get back within our range and we've liked that when we're in that range, because it gives us the most ability to use all the levers of our allocation strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. It's Stacey Cugan [ph] filling in for Paul, I had a follow-up question on your Activewear margins, I know you talked about some factors that impacted the margins this quarter and I think you also mentioned a spending shift for second quarter. But as you look out to the margins for the full year for the Activewear business, where should we expect them to fall and as you look out into the future, what should we expect from the margins in that business? Thanks.","Barry Hytinen","Thank you for that question. As it relates to the first quarter, the Activewear margin was just slightly down, and that was, call it, a couple of million dollars, which is the two items I called out. And as we look at the second quarter, we are expecting a slight year-on-year decline in US Activewear's operating margin and expansion in the second half, as compared to the prior outlook. That's due to the, if you will, acceleration of the spending into the second quarter from the back half. And where can it go in the future? Well, I think, it's clearly going higher. The gross margin on the segment is increasing and there are -- we have high visibility on that continuing for an extended period of time, thanks to: one, Champion growing, and that mix into a better margin business for us; improved pricing leverage and scale.","And in addition, as we remix out of some of that lower margin product in the rest of Activewear that I mentioned that's just gives us an incremental tailwind. So, over the foreseeable future, I would anticipate, starting in the back half and going forward, US Activewear's operating margins to expand and continue to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Carla Casella","On supply chain question, Champion's growing so quickly and you seem to be keeping up with that nicely, can you just talk about supply chain and what's your lead time, how long is it taking you, as you're coming up with new products, and if you see any changes on the supply chain front going forward.","Gerald Evans","Well, we certainly have kept up with the growth of Champion, and we've done that by working very carefully across the organization to forecast the business and then put the appropriate capacity in place. This product is coming through our standard supply chain, using our current fabrics and things that we developed largely in-house. So we're leveraging that way that. This is a pre-booked business that we sell from season to season and it behaves very much like our other seasonal businesses. So we're very much focused on forward view on where the business is going and continuing to have the appropriate capacity in place to handle it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David [ph] with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Do you expect any effect on your champion licensing revenue for the bankruptcy of source?","Gerald Evans","Source license was a, was a relatively modest portion of the Champion business, but given the pace at which the business is growing. We think that will be more than covered by that the upside. We're seeing throughout the business.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow-up question from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Laurent Vasilescu","Thanks for taking my follow-up question. Barry, did you guys actually how global actually grew for the quarter. And then any thoughts about how Europe did for the quarter. That would be great.","Barry Hytinen","Total global Champion was nearly $490 million in the quarter on a constant currency basis and that was up as we mentioned in Gerald remarks 75%, which was about $210 million of growth. Internationally, it was up high '60s on a percentage basis to nearly $290 million, that's up $115 million on a constant currency basis. And then if I help you with the domestic side that leaves about $200 million in the domestic business. In US Activewear we had nearly $190 million of sales within Champion excluding C9 that was up over 80% or $85 million worth of growth. And then outside of US Activewear we had about $10 million a champion for example in basics and things of that nature and that of course is growing even faster. So we feel really good about how Champion is performing.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  Charlie Stack, Chief Investor Relations Officer you may begin your conference.","Charlie Stack ","Welcome to the Hanesbrands\u2019 quarterly investor conference call and webcast.  We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the fourth quarter of 2011.  Hopefully everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.  The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the investors section of our www.Hanesbrands.com website.  ","I want to remind everyone that we may make forward-looking statements on the call today either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question and answer session.  These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.  These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC such as our most recent Forms 10K and 10Q as well as our news releases and other communications.","The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements which speak only to the time at which they are made.  With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer, Gerald Evans, one of our two Co-Chief Operating Officers, and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer.  For today\u2019s call Rich will highlight a few big picture themes, Gerald will provide a sense of what\u2019s happening in a few of our major businesses, and Rick will emphasis some of the financial aspects of our results.  I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard A. Noll ","The Q4 results and the 2012 guidance we release today are clearly below our expectations and the high standards we set for Hanesbrands, with the same challenges that face others in our industry are weighing on our results.  Importantly, for 2012 excluding our issues in outerwear which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, the rest of our businesses should grow both sales and profits on top of 2011\u2019s record levels.  We should quickly get through our challenges and then you should see the true earnings power of the company in the back half.","I will start by highlighting a few key themes followed by Rick and Gerald giving you more details.  Specifically, I will summarize why we missed expectations in Q4, the solid state of our core businesses, the challenges we face in the wholesale channel of our outerwear business, and then conclude with a few comments concerning our renewed focus on cash flow and debt reduction.","First, we clearly missed our Q4 guidance due to an unexpected sales short fall.  Operating profits missed proportionately and while EPS didn\u2019t miss quite as much we find that little consolation.  What happened was relatively simple, into early November both our retail sell through rates and retailer order pace was tracking to our expectations.  However, in December while our sell through rates remained in line with our expectations the order pace from retailers slowed substantially as they became rather nervous about mounting inventories throughout their apparel departments.  As retailers began to markdown and clear out their cold weather apparel we expect the order pace to return to normal and equal our sell through rates.  ","The December short fall aside, we achieved much in 2011.  We instituted multiple double digit price increases, managed unprecedented inflation, and completed the build out of our global supply chain.  With all that, we recorded record sales, record operating margins, record EPS, and reduced long term debt to a record low $1.8 billion.  ","Notably, our core business worked quite well.  We implemented three price increases and competitors have followed.  Elasticity was within our expectations and price gaps are now closing to what we believe are appropriate long term levels.  Both male underwear and socks increased sales and profit in 2011, a trend we expect to continue in 2012.  I am very proud of the hard work and dedication of our teams to make 2011 a record year.","Now, let me comment on our single biggest challenge in 2012 which is in our outerwear segment.  As a reminder, outerwear is comprised of both active wear and casual wear products that we sell to both retailers and wholesalers.  A portion of the wholesale channel is where we\u2019re having issues.  For simplicity, we refer to this as image wear.  It\u2019s here where we are seeing the impact of a hyper competitive pricing environment.","While small, in 2011 image wear performed well growing sales to 8% of the company with double digit operating margins.  However, things changed in the fourth quarter.  The two largest suppliers began fighting for unit share especially in the most promotionally driven sectors of this channel.  This fight led to rapid price declines just as the industry was facing the highest cotton costs in history unfortunately creating a perfect storm.","Our strategy is to maintain the premium and core sectors where pricing is reasonable for the go forward price of cotton but deemphasize the highly price sensitive promotional sector and let units and sales fall.  For us, this is a business model decision because we are all about brands.  As we make this transition, image sales will be smaller but we believe we\u2019ll be more profitable and less volatile.  ","Despite the relative size of image wear sales, this perfect storm is substantially impacting our 2012 profit results leading to our EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.60.  The rest of the business will be dampened somewhat by inflation but for the full year it should grow both sales and profits.  Both the image wear issue and inflation substantially impact our margins in Q1 causing a loss. ","While we\u2019re not thrilled with a loss in Q1, we anticipate that we\u2019ll get through the majority of our issues very quickly.  Operating margins therefore, should return to the mid to high single digits in Q2 and double digits in Q3.  As the overhang of temporary inflation quickly passes, our back half profit run rate will show our true earnings power.","Lastly, we have a renewed focus on cash flow as inflation on [wines] and our heavy supply chain investments are now completed free cash flow should be very strong for the next number of years.  In fact, in 2012 we anticipate generate free cash flow of our $400 to $500 million or over $4 per share.  ","Importantly, our priorities for that cash are crystal to clear, to reduce debt.  By December we want debt reduced to $1.5 billion and in 22 short months we could reduce our outstanding bonds to as low as $1 billion.  This is a marked change from the recent past as we had to deal with inflation but rest assured it is our intent that debt will fall.  ","So to conclude, our brands, our retail partnerships, and our core businesses are strong.  We\u2019re working quickly to stabilize outerwear in the wholesale channel and we are focusing cleaning on debt reduction.  As we believe this inflation overhang will soon pass, we should have good momentum later in 2012 and heading into 2013. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Gerald Evans.","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","With Rich\u2019s high level overview of the business as a backdrop I would now like to talk about the performance of each of our key segments in 2011 as well as the primary drivers we see for each in 2012.  This will provide some more detail on the individual areas of the business as there are factors that affect each differently.","First, I want to start with our core innerwear business.  Our innerwear business, particularly our male underwear and socks businesses continue to perform well in 2011.  Even with inflationary pressures, innerwear operating profit was up 5% for the full year.  ","Now, let me talk briefly about pricing in those core retail businesses.  We implemented three price increases in 2011 and competitors have ultimately followed with overall pricing in the industry reaching levels for the average cost of cotton in 2012.  We led the price increases with weaker competitors initially trying to gain an advantage by delaying by roughly a quarter.  Their delay caused price gaps to widen but we generally anticipated their actions or corrected as needed.  Elasticity was in our range of expectations.","Price gaps are now closing to what we believe are appropriate long term levels.  As our visibility took the cost and pricing environment has improved, we solidified 2012 pricing with retailers to selectively adjust prices or increase pack sizes that optimize our competitive gap.  All of which is built into our guidance.","All-in-all our retail partners have come to appreciate that price increases are driving their comp sales and profitability.  In fact, even after three price increases in 2011 we continue to earn new shelf space at retail in 2012.  Some of the largest gains are coming from Hanes Comfort Blend underwear and socks which will be supported with a new advertising campaign featuring Michael Jordan.  ","We are also encouraged by gains in intimate apparel driven by our Comfort Flex Fit platform and we are gaining space in hosiery as well.  These gains alone could generate a couple of points of sales growth for innerwear in 2012.  ","Now, let me move to outerwear.  Let me remind you that our outerwear business is comprised of four categories: image wear, which I will discuss first; as well as, Champion; casual wear; and gear for sports.  Let me begin with our plans for image wear.  As Rich discussed, we are experiencing somewhat of a perfect storm in that category.  ","The premium and core sectors appear to be appropriately priced for the longer term cost of cotton and should therefore return to historic levels of profitability as inflation quickly unwinds.  However, the promotional sector which represents about a third of the overall market and roughly one quarter of our image wear sales is a different story.  Here, competitors are fighting for unit volumes of promotional t-shirts where share could easily shift based on the lowest price of the day.  To make it worse, the industry offers volume incentives to drive further unit volume in this sensitive segment.  ","While we have been less involved than our competitors in the promotional sector, it is clear that we need to deemphasize this portion of image wear.  Our business model is about brands not the deal of the day.  In response, we have removed growth incentives from products in the promotional sector and moved to dead net everyday pricing.  While we expect promotional units and therefore sales to fall, we do not need to chase units at any costs.","We are making the necessary minor supply chain adjustments which represent between 2% to 3% of our capacity.  Inherent in our guidance is an expectation that pricing in the promotional category could deteriorate a little further.  Ultimately, as we resize this piece of the outerwear wholesale business, what remains should be smaller, less volatile and offer relatively consistent levels of profitability over time.  ","While we believe we have identified the proper path for image wear we will need to manage through a transition in 2012 which should result in the category losing money especially in Q1 and negatively impacting EPS by approximately $0.30.  ","Now shifting to Champion, that category continues to perform well at retail and gain market share in the desirable 18 to 34 year old market.  With sales expect to grow led by new programs at major sporting goods retailers as well as expansion of the [C9 brand at Target.  Casual wear will continue to reflect the loss of the fashion piece to the Just My Size business that is transitioning to private label but should begin to stabilize as newly added Hanes programs begin to set in late Q1 and into Q2.","Finally, we just completed our first full year with Gear For Sports and it continues to perform extremely well.  2011 was a record year in terms of both sales and profitability and Gear is on track to deliver an estimated $40 million of operating profit in 2012, up $10 million driven primarily by synergies. ","Now, turning to our global supply chain with our manufacturing footprint now in place and heavy investments behind us, capital spending should drop to around $45 million around 2012 and $40 million per year for the next three to five years.  In the near term, due to lower unit volumes from price elasticity and the previous mentioned changes, we are adjusting manufacturing capacity mainly by taking time out in our facilities as well as eliminating certain contractors.  These proposed actions totaling approximately $20 million are built into our guidance and should take place primarily in the first quarter of 2012.  ","So in closing, while we continue to experience significant short term pressure from image wear, our core businesses remain strong and should grow both sales and profits in 2012.  As we deliver value to our consumers and sales and profitability to our customers, we continue to gain shelf space at retail which is ultimately the best measure of the overall health of these businesses. ","I will now turn the call over to Rick Moss, our CFO to discuss our financial performance.","Richard D. Moss ","First, I\u2019d like to provide a few highlights from the fourth quarter and then review our guidance for 2012, as well as provide some perspective on the longer term prospects of the business as we look beyond the cotton headwinds currently working their way through our results.  ","Sales in 2012 were $4.6 billion up 7%, EPS came in at $2.69 up 25% and our operating margin for the year was 10.3%, all records for the company.  EBITDA for the full year also increased 20% to $563 million.  For the fourth quarter sales were $1.1 billion, flat with prior year and EPS came in at $0.41.  Gross margins were 29.1% for the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points or $14 million compared to last year.  Outerwear was the main contributor to the decrease in gross margins as sales in our Just My Size brand and profitability in image wear declined.  Innerwear and hosiery delivered small gross profit gains versus prior year while international and direct-to-consumer were down slightly.","In the quarter, higher input costs net of total pricing represented an approximate $20 million head wind.  Our Fourth quarter SG&A rate was 22.5% of sales versus 23.2% last year.  SG&A dollars decreased by $9 million over the prior year primarily driven by lower distribution costs.  Interest expense was $2 million lower than last year and income tax expense was negative in the quarter as we true upped to reflect a full year rate of 15.5% in 2011 versus 9.6% in 2010.  ","Looking at the balance sheet, inventory at the end of the year totaled $1.6 billion up $285 million versus previous year end with approximately $250 million related to inflation and $25 million from incremental units primarily supporting our international growth.  Cash from operations for the year totaled $168 million including $28 million in contributions to our pension plans.  We generated approximately $200 million in cash flow in the fourth quarter which we used to prepay $200 million of our floating rate notes.","Now, let\u2019s turn to 2012 guidance.  For the full year we expect sales growth of 2% to 4% compared to fiscal 2011.  We expect EPS for the year to be $2.50 to $2.60 which includes a loss of approximately $0.30 per share in image wear.  Let me take a moment to discuss the key drivers underlying this guidance and how our quarterly performance will be impacted.  ","From a sales perspective we are estimating first quarter sales around $1 billion.  Excluding the impact of image wear we\u2019re expecting sales trends in the first four to five months of 2012 fairly consistent with the back half of 2011 or roughly flat versus prior year.  As our new shelf space gains begin to set and we anniversary the double digit price increases taken in late May 2011, we expect to see sales grow.","Turning to image wear\u2019s impact on the P&L, we expect to loss approximately $0.30 per share primarily in the first half of the year and spread equally between the first two quarters.  As cotton inflation unwinds and we start to pull back from the promotional sector, we should begin to see the premium and core sectors return to profitability.  However, as we continue to evaluate the overall image wear category throughout the year, we will also need to revisit some of its associated intangibles from acquisitions during the 90s which may or may not result in a non-cash charge.","Back to the total business, we expect our first quarter gross profit margin percentage to be in the mid 20s range with about half of the decline from outwear driven by image wear and Just My Size, with the balance coming from inflation and cost associated with our supply chain adjustments.  We expect relatively flat Q1 SG&A resulting in an estimated $0.35 per share loss for the quarter.","As the impact of cotton driven inflation wanes, second quarter gross margins should improve to the high 20s leading to operating margins in the mid to high single digits.  The back half of the year could then see gross margins return to the low 30s with operating margins in the low double digits.  For the year, interest expense should be approximately $15 million lower than 2011 and our tax rate should be in the low double digits for 2012.","Turning to free cash flow guidance, many of the headwinds we saw from working capital in 2011 should reverse and become significant sources of cash for us in 2012.  Our free cash flow guidance of $400 to $500 million reflects the unwinding of inflation in working capital as well as reduced unit inventories.  This free cash flow guidance includes pension contributions between $30 to $35 million and roughly $45 million in capital expenditures.","We paid down $200 million of our floating rate notes in December and long term debt at the end of 2011 totaled $1.8 billion.  We currently plan to pay down the remaining $300 million of floating rate notes at the end of 2012 with a goal of prepaying our 8% notes when they become callable in late 2013.  This would result in a substantial decline in interest expense versus historical levels and would bring our total outstanding bonds to $1 billion at the end of 2013.","Now I\u2019d like to communicate a few of our thoughts related to the longer term prospects of the business.  As we move past the early year challenges of inflation in image wear and the loss in Q1, inherent in our 2012 guidance is an average operating profit margin of approximately 11% for the second through fourth quarters.  ","While it\u2019s too early to provide 2013 guidance, a 10% to 11% profit run rate could be a good assumption for modeling purposes.  When coupled with expected lower interest expense, one could reasonably model 2013 EPS potential in the low $3 range.  So while we don\u2019t like the near term results due to the cotton bubble and the pricing issues in image wear as you can see we believe they will soon pass allowing the profitability and cash flow potential of our core businesses to reemerge.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Charlie.","Charlie Stack ","That concludes the recap of our performance for the fourth quarter.  Now, we will begin taking your questions and we\u2019ll continue as time allows.  Since there may be a number of you who will like to ask a question, I\u2019ll ask that you limit your questions to one question plus a follow up then reenter the queue to ask any additional questions.  I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","I guess the first question I have is can you talk a little as you look at the guidance you\u2019ve given, the fourth quarter results, the visibility that you have as the year is laid out today with the call meaning that when you consider where you were 90 days ago or at the beginning of November you sort of had a $0.10 range in your fourth quarter estimate and now sort of we\u2019re at the beginning of this year and your range appears pretty narrow as well, a $0.10 range, so can you just talk a little bit about your visibility around how you see the business?  Especially, in the back half as cotton sort of does come down and through the supply chain the margin implications around that and your ability to achieve those numbers?","Richard A. Noll ","Overall, I feel really good about our ability to achieve the guidance we talked about for 2012.  Let me first hit on and reiterate what happened in Q4, give you a little bit more color around that and then how that relates into sort of what our overall sales assumptions are and the guidance for 2012.  As I said, sell through rates were running fine right to our expectations, orders from retailers were running fine.  ","December came though and retailers always bring their inventories down before their year end, normally it\u2019s in January, this time it was in December and in fact, the only other time I\u2019ve seen that in 20 years of being in these types of businesses was in December of 2008.  That inventory pull down equaled that level.  It didn\u2019t have to do as much with our categories as really retailers were worried about their overall apparel levels of inventory because they were dealing with inflation, cold weather gear was starting to mount up.  ","A lot of them came out after Christmas and actually called their earnings down because they know they\u2019re going to have to take markdowns to clear it out and we just got all caught up in that.  As we\u2019ve now said we\u2019re going into 2012 let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re not trying to build in anything that we aren\u2019t already seeing in our expectations and so our sales run rate projections inherent in this guidance are pretty clear.  It\u2019s relatively flat sales excluding the issue we\u2019ve got in image wear until we start to shift those space gains and we actually start to overlap the double digit price increases in late May where our competitive gap started to widen.","I feel really good about the foundation upon which we\u2019ve built this plan.  In terms of the overall range, at the end of the day there\u2019s no question we missed Q4.  I don\u2019t like to miss, it irritates me by no small stretch of the imagination.  But, I think it\u2019s appropriate when we look at our overall business to have a tight range.  I think our $0.20 range last year was relatively wide, it was almost 10%, and it was because of the uncertainty that we had to deal with pricing and we don\u2019t see that kind of uncertainty in 2012, hence the narrower range.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","I guess as you talk about it, can you elaborate a little more given the reduction in the Just My Size and the negotiations on the new programs, can you talk a little bit more about the shelf space gains you are expecting?  Is there an updated number in terms of is it 2% of your top line in shelf space gains when you look at different buckets for the top line guidance?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","Let me just give you a little color on the Just My Size situation first.  We have one more quarter to really wrap the impact of the loss of the fashion segment of that and that will be the first quarter and that will be in the range of $25 to $30 million.  As we go into the second quarter we begin to offset that with the placement of some new Hanes programs that will go into effect and we\u2019ll begin to see casual wear grow going forward.  We feel like we\u2019ve got one more quarter and then that\u2019s behind us.","From the standpoint of additional space gains, we\u2019re really gaining across the board.  As I referenced in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing great gains, we\u2019re actually gaining space from both private label and other brands in our underwear, socks, intimate apparel as well as hosiery so we feel like we\u2019ve got real good strong momentum on all fronts.","Richard A. Noll ","Champion as well, you mentioned we\u2019ve got good space gains going there so when you exclude image wear we actually feel really good about the health of our overall business.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup","I guess I just wanted to drill down on the guidance really quick again.  I guess the way I look at it, if you add back the $0.30 impact from screen print and then you think about where the supply change savings and the cost synergies from Gear take you, it almost seems like you\u2019re expecting the core business ex the screen print to be down year-over-year?  Maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on how you expect those businesses to pan out in terms of top line and margins?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","The screen print business or the image wear business as we call it, as we said will contribute about a $0.30 a share loss this year.  It will be about half in the first quarter and half in the second.","Richard A. Noll ","When you look at the rest of the business, when you subtract that out, actually operating profit should be up in the 5% range.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup","Then you\u2019re also expecting top line to be up for the rest of the business too?","Richard A. Noll ","Yes.  Inherent in our guidance is 2% to 4% total growth.  Image wear will actually be a little bit down so that\u2019s actually mitigating that somewhat.  So yes, overall sales the rest of the business will be up.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup","I may have missed it, did you just give a percent in terms of the space gains that you guys had?  I think last quarter maybe you said 2% or 3% for this year?","Richard A. Noll ","We do think that the space gains are in line with that sort of increase, yes.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup","Then just one more question on the image wear business, maybe if you could talk about what changed from last quarter that changed your guidance so significantly?  If you could just talk about pricing, kind of where yours has gone versus the competition, and is it all priced in now?  Then also as we enter the second half of \u201912 do you think the lower cotton cost will help your image wear business?  Should we somewhat of a rebound there in terms of margins?","Richard A. Noll ","Overall, our sales in the wholesale channel which we call image wear, the business is about 8% of our sales.  Last year it had double digit operating margins.  However, in the fourth quarter there was some share shifts going on late in the year and the two largest suppliers started to go after and fight for unit share and that let to them fighting on price after the most pricing sensitive segments of the market which led to a rapid decline in overall pricing which we really started to see just in the fourth quarter, just in the last few months.","That\u2019s just sort of changed that landscape and when you couple that with the high cotton cost coming through, like I said it creates that perfect storm really weighing our results in the near term and you\u2019re seeing that from other people that have announced their results that operate in this segment.  In terms of why we\u2019re pulling back from some of these segments, at the end of the day it\u2019s really a business model issue.  ","If you go back five, six, seven years ago we\u2019ve actually had a few hundred million of private label business in our retail accounts and so on and so forth and we decided we needed to be a branded company and try and reduce the volatility that you see in private label and very price sensitive segments of the market.  We\u2019ve done all of that, the last place we need to do it is in this wholesale channel and I think this is the right strategy to make sure that what we sell in the image wear channel fits the rest of our business model, focusing on where people worry about product quality and brands matter.","Susan Anderson \u2013 Citigroup","Then in terms of pricing did you guys bring your pricing down to match the competitors or are you just kind of losing the sales as you go and like you said just kind of exiting out of that part of the business?","Richard A. Noll ","No, by any stretch of the imagination in this market overall you need to be competitive.  We\u2019re very competitive, the only thing we\u2019ve changed is on the most price sensitive segment of the market.  We\u2019ve eliminated any volume incentives because we don\u2019t have any desire to grow that category.  So we\u2019re relatively competitive, we believe that this is a business that we want to be in and we\u2019ll be in for the long term in that premium and core segment and it will return to its historical levels of profitability as we get through the inflation issues that we have in the first couple of quarters.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Eric B. Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Rich, if you could talk beyond the image wear business, broadly within innerwear, maybe speak to the cadence of the top line guidance relative to some of the cautious inventory positioning and maybe the pricing strategy, particularly in the back half of the year as we start to normalize some of this cyclical cost inflation sort of what your view is from an industry broad prospective and sort of how you guys play into that?","Richard A. Noll ","Let me start with that really broad industry view how not just people in our under wear situation or space were reacting but how the enter apparel industry has reacted.  Overall, as everybody has been faced with inflation you hear time and time again that there\u2019s a tendency to price for the average price of cotton for 2012.  You\u2019re hearing that from people that sell to department stores, we hear it from major suppliers from Asia, we hear it from people that are predominately in the retail business and they expect a little bit of margin compression in the first couple of quarters and actually to make up for it a little bit in 2012.","You\u2019ll hear that refrain over, and over again, and we\u2019re no different.  I think that\u2019s how pricing ended up playing overall in our innerwear segment.  So for us overall, cotton other than in image wear, cotton is not a profit issue it\u2019s more of a timing issue for us because those categories should end up with operating profits up for the year.  ","In terms of how we\u2019ve gone through it, we\u2019ve been working with our retailers very closely on all of these pricing dynamics over the last 18 months and today is no different.  They have line of site where cotton\u2019s going, we basically already talked to them and have pricing locked in for 2012, having all that baked in and it\u2019s in our guidance so we feel really good about our pricing situation and we\u2019re feeling really good about how retailers responded to our leadership in this category demonstrated by the space gains that we\u2019re getting.","Eric B. Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Just a follow up to that then, and it sounds like you got really good visibility to the pricing, is there a chance that some competitors that try to enter the branded apparel space get much more aggressive from a pricing perspective?  Kind of what\u2019s your thought there?","Richard A. Noll ","In the retail channel everybody had to take price and did take price with all the inflation that\u2019s here.  In fact, one of our major competitors took three price increases as we did and they took it up to that average cost of cotton going forward for 2012.  So let me make it crystal clear everybody in the retail arena had to take price so don\u2019t extrapolate anything that\u2019s going on in the wholesale image wear channel as to what may happen in the retail arena.","In terms of other big competitors that have been trying to come into this arena and talking about it I\u2019ve been getting the question about [Gilda] and entering into our space time and time again for many, many years about how they\u2019re going to come into the retail space.  So it felt like it was forever so I actually ask somebody, when did they first start to announce they were going to enter into the retail business?  We went back, we looked at their transcript and it was their fourth quarter call in 2003.  ","So they\u2019ve been at this for nine solid years.  In the last three years alone we\u2019ve grown our underwear and sock business 20%.  We\u2019ve expanded space, we\u2019ve continued to expand space, we take share from major competitors, private label including them and so we feel really good about how our brands resonate for consumers, work for our retailers, and our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits in those key categories.","Eric B. Tracy \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Then maybe switching gears if I could a bit, really nice to see sort of the reemphasis on debt pay down using the aggressive free cash to delever here over the next couple of years.  Is there a shift sort of in the thinking or just sort of walk through the thought process there, why get more aggressive?  Is there a thinking of an optimized cap structure now at two times?","Richard A. Noll ","What\u2019s the change in our thinking overall about the capital structure?  Let me give you sort of the big picture theme and then turn it over to Rick to talk about some of the more specifics.  I really think there\u2019s an overriding theme here about risk.  I hear in the investment community people talking about risk on versus risk off.  There\u2019s clearly a lower appetite for risk in the investment community and we share that.  So we\u2019re looking through our business and saying, \u201cHow do we reduce the risk of our business model?\u201d  ","The thing we\u2019re talking about and pulling back in the image wear and that price sensitive area, it\u2019s all about managing risk.  Those types are things are always going to be more volatile than branded oriented business.  And, our capital structure with our leverage introduces risk into our business model.  As you have some smaller shocks they get magnified a little bit more on your bottom line.","We\u2019re in a mode where we want our business model and our financial results to be less volatile and we think that will pay dividends ultimately in our stock price being less volatile.  Rick, do you want to talk about the specifics on capital structure and debt pay down?","Richard D. Moss ","I think just to add to what Rich said first, by continuing to deleverage the balance sheet we\u2019re going to be able to significantly improve our financial flexibility.  It\u2019s going to enable us to return cash to shareholders in the forms of dividends and\/or stock buy backs, it increases our capacity for potential acquisitions, and really when you think about it what we\u2019re trying to do is really a timing issue.  Let\u2019s get the debt down to a level that\u2019s appropriate for our business and then we have a lot of opportunities, a lot of options open to us at that point.","Operator","","Your next question comes from David Glick \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group. ","David Glick \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group","I was just wondering if you could help us kind of breakdown your outlook by your reporting segments, just generally relative to your 2% to 4% range clearly the image wear business is a drag but if you can kind of quickly walk us through the segments and how that growth would compare to the total?  And in particular, the international business a little bit softer than I expected and previously you guys had talked about double digit growth there, I\u2019m wondering if we can expect to see that?  Finally, is there some kind of restocking embedded in your sales outlook?  Clearly, it sounds like sell through exceeded the ship in and at what point do you expect to see the benefit and is that incorporated into your assumptions in innerwear and intimates?","Richard A. Noll ","Let me do a quick answer to the [inaudible] and then the big one and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Gerald for international.  We have no inherent restocking built into our guidance.  So we\u2019re saying inventories will stay at these levels.  In terms of more specific guidance by segment, at the end of the day we don\u2019t really want to go through segment-by-segment and talk about sales and operating profit increases at that level of detail.","Suffice it to say we feel good about all of the rest of our business with the exception of the image wear and that wholesale channel.  Internationally specifically though we have talked about and let me have Gerald give you a couple of highlights there and some of the expectations.","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","International had a strong year for 2011.  We were up 14% sales growth for the year.  We did slow down a bit in the fourth quarter in international in a couple of countries.  It was not immune from some of the same challenges we felt in the US business, particularly our largest business Canada felt a slowdown in both the intimate apparel category as well as a slowdown in order pace as we moved towards the holiday period and there was some general softness in Europe related to the economy.","But as we look to 2012 we expect another strong year.  Our Latin America businesses, particularly our Brazil businesses and our Asian businesses, and particularly our China businesses, are all growing very strongly and we expect to be on a double digit pace once again.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","A big picture question for you Rich, the plan for the business had been low to mid single digit revenue growth with operating margin expansion.  Is that now out the window?  Do you still see this as a growth business?  I hear about cap ex plan below D&A, emphasis on cash flow, it seems as if there\u2019s a change in operating philosophy as we look forward?","Richard A. Noll ","Let me start by reminding you, we grew our gross margin 50 basis points in 2011 and got 50 basis points of SG&A leverage so we feel really good about our ability to continue our margin expansion.  The cap ex really has to do with the fact that our footprint is now in place and we don\u2019t need any more spending for big moves.  ","We still have ample capacity to grow within that footprint.  In fact, one of our largest facilities Nanjing is only half full so the ability to continue to expand and support 3%, to 4%, to 5% top line growth on a consistent basis is within that footprint and within that type of capital spending that we\u2019re talking about.  ","So we didn\u2019t build it to be tight in a box and not support growth.  What we don\u2019t need to do is pick up factories and move them around the world anymore and that\u2019s why the capital expenditures are coming down.  We still think that our businesses have a lot of room for growth.  International, we\u2019ve still got that growth out there by mid decade to have it reach a billion dollars.","I think the focus on cash flow though, as Rick said, is more of a timing issue.  We need to take some risk out of the business by delivering.  We\u2019ve got strong cash flow coming now as inflation unwinds.  It\u2019s a good time to reduce that risk, reduce the volatility, and then we\u2019ll have a lot more flexibility to drive value with that cash flow either through returning cash to shareholders or doing like we did for Gear For Sports and doing opportunistic acquisitions.","The business model really hasn\u2019t changed and so I feel good about our prospects.  By growing the top line, continuing to expand margins, and using that cash to drive an ever great growth of EPS.","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Just a follow up on that related to the operating margins, the guidance for the second half of the year implies I guess double digit operating margins yet you\u2019re talking about 11% operating margins into 2013.  What do you see as a sustainable operating margin run rate for this business given your current portfolio and where you expect to take it?  Maybe what\u2019s near term sustainable and longer term achievable?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","Well I think based on what we said today if you look again back from Q2 to Q4 you see that 11% operating profit margin is above historically what we\u2019ve been able to do.  Then we said we think that\u2019s sustainable to 10% to 11% level through \u201913.  Beyond that I would just say, reiterating what Rick said a little earlier, we think they\u2019re going to continue to be opportunities for us to improve our profitability over time and we\u2019re going to be diligent about making sure that over time we do consistently provide greater return on our sales.","Richard A. Noll ","Don\u2019t over focus on what Rick was trying to help you do from a modeling perspective to think about next year.  I think one of the major things we\u2019re trying to communicate is to say we don\u2019t view the numbers that we\u2019re talking about for 2012 for a new low base from which we modestly grow.  And, I think what we\u2019re trying to communicate is that we would expect things to snap back in 2013 and I think that\u2019s the message you want to take away from it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","I wanted to actually follow up on the price increases and help me understand how much of that are you guys going to be able to keep through pack sizes, are you going to have to give back later in the year as lower cost cotton flows through?  In the retail business not the screen print, and how we should think about how that\u2019s impacting your sales growth guidance for the year too?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","As we went out and led the price increases we certainly had gaps widen for a while but we have seen the competitors follow and we think the industry is generally priced to the average cost of cotton in the market.  As Rich noted, in certain cases we\u2019ve now gone out, we\u2019ve seen what\u2019s going in the market, we\u2019ve worked with our retailers to make some adjustments whether it be in price or in pack size.  Those are making their way to market now and we\u2019ve effectively locked down our prices with our retailers for the balance of the year.","Richard A. Noll ","If I could just put it in context with the history of I think the question you\u2019re asking.  We did with our three price increases price for a higher level of cotton with our third price increase than what we\u2019re all seeing for the average of 2012.  I think by the time some of our other competitors put in their three price increases was about a quarter later and they didn\u2019t go quite that high and that\u2019s necessitating some of this adjustment that we\u2019re talking about.","But, all of our retailers know exactly where they\u2019re going to end up.  It\u2019s built into our guidance and it\u2019s clearly locked in, even through our promotion through back-to-school.  So we feel really good about our situation. ","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Help me out, if you don\u2019t mind, on the guidance for the gross margin for the first quarter it seems like you guys are looking for I guess 900 basis points pressure and a lot of it is coming from the screen print business, if I\u2019m not mistaken.  Help me through the math how a business that represents 8% of the mix is having that big of an impact on the gross margin.  Are there other pieces to it as well?","Richard D. Moss ","Let me walk you through some of the math on that and break that down for you.  Before I do that let me again, just reiterate a couple of points.  As you put Q1 kind of in the context of the full year it\u2019s important to remember that image wear is a profit issue but when you look at the rest of the business cotton related inflation [inaudible] is a timing issue, a short term timing issue at that.  Remember that really all of the cotton related inflation that we\u2019re going to experience in the first half was actually on the balance sheet at the end of the year and it will flow through the P&L in the first half of the year impacting margins in the first quarter a little more than they will in the second quarter.  ","Let me be a little more specific.  When you think about the first quarter loss, it really is a gross margin issue.  We see gross margin again in the mid 20s, we\u2019re looking at about 800 or so margin drop in 2011.  About half of that is going to be from the outwear business, mostly from image wear but also remember we\u2019ve got the Just My Size sales decline of $25 to $30 million in sales that will impact profitability in that quarter as well.","We\u2019ll have about 150 basis points of that margin decline will be from supply chain costs that Gerald referred to, cost associated with adjusting the supply chain and the balance will be the cotton inflation.  Again, because the first quarter tends to be a little bit smaller quarter, actually 15% to 20% smaller than the other quarters, it\u2019s going to have a bigger impact than it will in the other quarters, the second quarter.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ken Stumphauzer \u2013 Sterne Agee.","Ken Stumphauzer \u2013 Sterne Agee","I just had  a couple of ones, first as far as a clarification, the down time you guys are taking in 1Q is that included in the $0.30 number you quoted for the image wear division?","Richard D. Moss ","No, it\u2019s not.","Ken Stumphauzer \u2013 Sterne Agee","Then secondly, regarding the guidance I actually have a hard time getting to the numbers unless I assume that SG&A is down pretty considerably the last three quarters of the year.  Is that a reasonable assumption or is there something else that I could perhaps be missing?Richard D. Moss ","I would think of SG&A basically as being flat for the year, flat to down slightly.","Ken Stumphauzer \u2013 Sterne Agee","Then just one last thing regarding the image wear and the hit you guys are taking in that division, can you explain the mechanics of that?  You guys are not writing down inventory, correct?  You\u2019re just selling the product at prices which would essentially involve a loss?  Is that correct and is that why it\u2019s being dragged out over two quarters?","Richard D. Moss ","No, it\u2019s the pricing environment relative to the cost of the goods that are being sold is an issue but it\u2019s not resulting in a NRV, net realizable value, issue from an accounting standpoint.  Remember, they have operating expenses that they have to cover as well.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Steve Marotta \u2013 CL King & Associates.","Steve Marotta \u2013 CL King & Associates","Rich, you mentioned earlier in the call that you hadn\u2019t seen the kind of destocking at retail in innerwear since December 2008.  Can you talk a little bit about magnitude of the comparable December 2011 and also how long it took for retailers to realize restocking?","Richard A. Noll ","Yes, I think the 2008 versus this December, like I said retailers always adjust inventories in January.  They rarely do it, I used to say never do it, in December now it\u2019s rarely do it in December.  Actually, the pull down in inventory that we saw in December of \u201911 was actually a little bit greater than the pull down in December \u201908 just to sort of give you the order of magnitude.  Gerald, do you want to comment on more recent sell through and order pace trends?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","What I would add from a standpoint of while the orders were pulled back drastically in December, our point of sale continued to meet expectations from the standpoint of how it\u2019s performing through the register.  As we exited that period and came into January, actually retail inventories were in pretty good shape from the standpoint of weeks of supply.  As we\u2019ve now come through January towards the beginning of retailers new fiscal years we\u2019re seeing the order rate normalize as it should be.","Steve Marotta \u2013 CL King & Associates","Looking back to 2009, how long did it take for retailers to restock from the December 2008 destocking?","Richard A. Noll ","That\u2019s not going to give you any indication of what\u2019s going on here because remember that was in the depths of the recession.  The stock market in January \u201909 was heading to 6,500 and their sell through rates across the board and their traffic was declining so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually a good model to try and project what\u2019s going on here.  This is much more of a short term anomaly, their dealing with their inflation numbers.  At the end of the day they all said they would let their dollar inventory go up a little bit because of inflation and at the end of the day their CFO said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t let it go up.\u201d  ","When you couple that with the warm weather and cold weather gear starting to mount up I think they started to get nervous and hit the button pretty quickly.  This is a very different situation than what you saw in 2009 because the fundamental sell through rates were starting to decline.  This was going towards our expectations, there was an adjustment that was bigger than we expected and clearly not at the time we expected.  But this too shall quickly pass.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Scott Krasik \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets.","Scott Krasik \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Just a couple things, explain to me this $20 million in manufacturing charges that is not in the $0.30?  Is that though strictly related to the down time around the inventory withdraw?","Gerald W. Evans, Jr. ","No, actually it\u2019s a combination of several things.  Coming out of last year and the destocking and the elasticity effects of price increases, we had the need to realign our inventories and so we\u2019re taking time out as well as we\u2019ve made some small adjustments in our supply chain related to pulling back on the promotional segment of the innerwear predominately taking out one of our own sewing facilities and exiting some contract facilities.  Generally, we have the contractors in place to flex and so forth.  It got a little costlier this time than typical because we do have this time out that we\u2019re taking to readjust inventory and that\u2019s why it\u2019s in the first quarter.","Scott Krasik \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","It\u2019s almost the reverse of the rush in costs from a year and a half ago?  There\u2019s some cost in terms of aligning demand with the inventory?","Richard A. Noll ","I think that\u2019s a fair statement although on an ongoing basis, just to give you an example, if we were trying to simply make a 2%, 3%, or 4% adjustment in our overall inventory levels, that\u2019s one or two weeks of time out which would be $4 or $5 million at most probably per week if you took the entire system down.  I think this one is a little bit compounded because you\u2019ve got the effects of elasticity that we need to take, our inventories are a little higher than we\u2019d like and we specifically want to drop those and improve our working capital productivity and generate cash.  To tell you the truth, some of this time out and this restructuring is one of the major reasons we can generate $400 to $500 million of free cash flow this year and we think it\u2019s a good trade off.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Eric Beder \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co.","Eric Beder \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co.","Could you talk about inventory levels?

Welcome to the HanesBrands\u2019 Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the meeting over to T C Robillard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","T C Robillard","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the HanesBrands\u2019 quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the third quarter of 2015. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release and the replay of the call can be found in the Investors section of our hanes.com website.","On the call today we may make forward-looking statements, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC, and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.","The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made. Unless otherwise noted, today\u2019s references to our consolidated financial results, as well as our 2015 guidance, exclude all one-time charges and expenses. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP, can be found in today\u2019s press release.","With me on the call today are Rich Noll, our Chief Executive Officer; Gerald Evans, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rick Moss, our Chief Financial Officer. For today\u2019s call, Rich will highlight a few big-picture themes, Gerald will focus on key highlights within our business operations and Rick will focus on certain financial aspects of our results.","I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Noll","Thank you, T.C. We had another great quarter. Earnings per share increased 16%, driven by strong core revenue growth, continued margin expansion and contributions from acquisitions. We bought back stock as we entered the next phase of our cash deployment strategy. And we took up our operating profit guidance for the third time this year due to the continued margin strength within our business. Our strong third quarter performance is simply a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing all year, driving great results for our shareholders.","We generated EPS growth of 16% in each of the first three quarters. And the midpoint of our guidance implies fourth quarter EPS growth of 25%, further demonstrating that we have the right set of strategies to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Looking at our results, we delivered on everything in the quarter that we told you we would. Revenue growth was strong, even with the impact from anticipated retail inventory adjustments, our shipments rebounded in the quarter. Core revenue increased 3% in constant currency and is up nearly 1.5% year-to-date. Our Champion business continued its strong performance with 33% sales growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels.","Our intimates business, which we said would turn in the quarter, increased 9% over last year. And even our basics business which saw the full impact of the inventory destocking, delivered strong results with sales up slightly in the quarter.","We also continued to see meaningful contributions from our acquisition strategy. Our Maidenform acquisition, it\u2019s still paying dividend with the additional synergies contribution to core margin expansion in the quarter, while DBA and Knights Apparel continue to add nicely to earnings.","Our cash deployment strategy entered a new phase in the quarter as we spent over $300 million buying back stock. Repurchases added about $0.01 to EPS in the quarter and are expected to add about $0.01 to EPS in each of the next three quarters.","In terms of guidance, based on the current momentum in our business, we are once again raising our operating profit and EPS outlook for the year. In fact, since the beginning of the year, we have increased our operating profit guidance $40 million and our EPS guidance, $0.07. That\u2019s the great thing about our business model. We have a lot of ways to drive strong results in a wide variety of situations.","In summary, we feel great about our business. We\u2019re on track to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth for the year, once again demonstrating there are strategies to create long-term shareholder value are working extremely well.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Evans","Thanks Rich. We delivered another quarter of great results. You\u2019ve heard us use that phrase many, many times over the past several years. And while it may sound like a broken record, it should is a great song. The strong third quarter results position us to the end of the year, above the high end of our original EPS outlook. Our performance year-to-date underscores two core facets of our company. The first, our business model is well tested and it has been able to consistently deliver strong returns for our shareholders in any environment. And the second, we are aligned across our organization to execute on our long-term strategies.","Let me start with an update on DBApparel and Knights Apparel. We are thrilled with these acquisitions are unfolding. Beyond their sizable synergy benefits, these acquisitions also provide us with significant future growth opportunities. And with the strong management teams we gained through these acquisitions, we are confident DBA and Knights can create value for shareholders, for many years. Looking at DBA, the business continues to perform well. Sales and profits were above plan for the quarter, as we continue to gain market share in key product categories within our core countries.","We have already begun implementing some of our supply chain integration activities. These were actions that fell outside of the scope of the Works Council process, such as renegotiating vendor contracts and proving efficiency and quality, as well as implementing expense control programs. In terms of the Works Council I am pleased to announce that we completed the final consultation in September. With the integration now in full swing, we expect the synergy benefits to ramp in 2016. Longer term, as we integrate their operations, we believe DBA provides us with us a great platform for future acquisitions in Europe.","Turing to Knights Apparel, their business continues to perform extremely well. Sales attracting to our full-year plan, while operating profit is coming in slightly ahead of plan. As we began the integration process, we reinforced our view that the combination of Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel provides us with significant long-term growth opportunities. The integration of these businesses will give us the infrastructure, the capability and the systems to deliver to a broad set of retail customers, across the entire graphic apparel market. And our goal overtime is to expand from the $3 billion licensed collegiate apparel market to the broader $20 billion graphic apparel market.","Switching to our segments, innerwear sales increased 3% in the quarter. A strong result, given the roughly $20 million retail inventory adjustment in basics. The real highlight was our intimates business, which increased 9% in the quarter, driven by our Hanes and Bali bras. With our brand consolidation strategy mainly behind us, we are able to see the full power of our new initiatives. We began advertising behind the ComfortFlex Fit platform in both Hanes and Bali, during the quarter and the response has been tremendous. Our Hanes Ultimate and Hanes Platinum collections, which are sold in mid-tier and department stores, are exceeding our initial expectations.","Shifting to Activewear, we are driving increased Champion distribution as our brand strategy continues to resonate with both consumers and retailers. This is was evident in our third quarter results as Champion sales, and the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels increased 33% over the last year. Our Activewear business also continues to benefit from our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy, as margins increased 230 basis points over the last year to a record 18.8%. Then turning to our core international business, which excludes DBA and the impact of the retailer exit from Canada, sales in constant currency increased 14% over the last year.","So to sum up, our business continue to perform extremely well. Our categories are healthy, our brands are strong and our strategies continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth. And we believe that this is something you\u2019ll see for many years to come.","I will now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Moss","Thanks, Gerald. It was four years ago, this month that I was on my first Hanesbrands earnings call as CFO. And reflecting that, I\u2019m amazed at how much our business has evolved. Over this time, we\u2019ve added approximately $1.4 billion of revenue in a much more diversified manner. Our international business has roughly doubled and is now about 20% of our sales. Our largest customer accounts for about 20% of our revenue today, down from the peak of 28%. And we now have limited exposure to low margin commodity product categories.","Over that same timeframe, we\u2019ve also significantly increased profitability as operating profit has nearly doubled, while margins have increased approximately 500 basis points. And we strengthened our balance sheet. Our net debt EBITDA ratio was decreased from four times to around 2.5 times today and is on its way to roughly two times by the end of the year. And we\u2019ve deployed over $2 billion in cash to create shareholder value through dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases.","Our strong performance over the past several years has been driven by a set of strategies that are designed to leverage our brand expertise, our company-owned supply chain and a corporate culture centered on continuous improvement. We have strategies to drive growth organically, as well as strategies to drive growth by wisely investing our cash flow, and going forward, we are confident that these can continue to generate strong returns as they are both scalable and repeatable.","Now let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter as they relate to our strategies. Shipments rebounded in the quarter as we indicated they would. Even with the impact from the retail inventory adjustment, our core revenue increased 3% in constant currency, it was up nearly a 1.5% year-to-date. This is a perfect example of why we remind investors not to over react to any single quarter, because wallet business may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, over time our shipments tend to equal our sellthrough due to the replenishment nature of our categories.","Core operating margins continue to expand up approximately 90 basis points over the last year. Driven by additional Maidenform synergies, benefits from Innovate-to-Elevate and the continued leverage of our core SG&A.","Turning to our cash deployment strategies, acquisitions continue to add to our earnings growth. DBA and Knights Apparel generated roughly $29 million in operating profit in the quarter. We also began repurchasing stock in the quarter spending approximately $311 million to buyback roughly 10.7 million shares, which added just under $0.01 to third quarter EPS.","Turning to guidance, we raised our operating profit guidance to a range of $880 million to $890 million from our prior range of $855 million to $875 million to reflect the strong margin performance in our business. We also raised our EPS guidance to a range of $1.66 to $1.68 from our previous range of $1.61 to $1.66 due to our increased profit guidance and contributions from share repurchases.","We also expect interest and other expense to increase to roughly $115 million, partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate of approximately 12%. I should also mention that the IRS just completed a substantial two-year audit, the results of which validate the sustainability of our tax strategies and further reinforce the benefits of our company-owned global supply chain.","Turning to the fourth quarter, our guidance implies a little over $1.5 billion in sales, which reflects about $20 million of seasonal programs that shift in Q3 rather than \u2013 earlier than initially expected. When you adjusted for last year\u2019s 53rd week our guidance implies core revenue growth in constant currency of about 3% for both the fourth quarter and the second half.","Fourth quarter operating profit is estimated to be $231 million to $241 million implying an operating margin range of roughly 15% to 16% for about the fourth quarter and the second half. At the midpoint of our guidance this would represent about 130 basis point improvement over the last year second half margins. And fourth quarter EPS is estimated to be a range of $0.44 to $0.46, which includes about $0.01 from share repurchases.","So in summary, our business strategies continue to deliver great results and this is reflected in our increased guidance for the year. And we\u2019re now on pace to deliver 17% to 18% EPS growth this year. And as we look forward, our growth strategies position us to continue to drive solid double-digit earnings growth for the next several years.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to T. C.","T C Robillard","Thanks Rick. That concludes the recap of our performance for the third quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows.","Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Hi thanks. Great quarter guys. Thanks for all the information.","Rich Noll","Thanks for the remark.","Rick Moss","Thanks Omar.","Omar Saad","A quick question on the P&L and the gross margin line, and the sales look great. Help me understand the dynamic there. It looks like it had been expanding at a faster rate, and maybe slowed a little bit this quarter. Is there a mix shift thing going on, or is there some other dynamic there we should understand especially as we look into 4Q and longer term? There's been some concern in the marketplace around pricing pressure and things like that.","Rick Moss","No actually I wanted to \u2013 this is Rick. It\u2019s actually a very simple thing, nice apparel in the quarter impact there our gross profit margin by that 50 basis points negatively. Absent from that our gross profit margin would have been up.","Omar Saad","Okay, great; that's really helpful. Thanks, Rick. And then one follow-up, I heard you mention the graphic apparel market, a $20 billion number. I know you've exited the screen print business, but you're building some graphic capabilities. Help us understand. What is this market you're talking about? Is this the fashion market? Is it a basics market? What's the opportunity there, and how far out are we talking about maybe potentially harvesting some of that market share in a market that big?","Gerald Evans","Yes Omar, this is Gerald. It\u2019s certainly not a fashion business, it\u2019s basic graphic apparel that is both licensed as well as generic graphics across various retail channels. And we\u2019d be looking to do is take advantage of our vertical capabilities that we have now from manufacturing through design to the printing, to the selling, to the various retail channels in which we operate. There\u2019s certainly other license properties that go across, as well as developing that graphic, generic graphic business. And so I\u2019ll certainly be looking as we get into 2016 and beyond to begin to focus beyond the collegian apparel market into those various areas.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy from Brean Capital.","Eric Tracy","Hi guys good afternoon and I\u2019ll add my congrats.","Rich Noll","Thanks Eric, how are you doing?","Eric Tracy","Alright, so Rich or Gerald, for you. Obviously there's been a lot of discussion around what's going on within the mass markets, in particular one of the larger accounts. You guys delivered against that despite some of those inventory adjustments. Maybe just speak again broadly of what you're seeing in the channel, how you guys are driving share, and the visibility through holiday if not into spring that you see in that channel.","Rich Noll","Yes, let me first just talk about the overall consumer environment, now that Gerald talk a little bit more specifically about some of that basic destocking that you are asking about. When we look at the overall consumer environment it\u2019s clearly mixed, it is a little uncertain out there, although it has been like that to be honest for many, many years. So it\u2019s probably the new normal if you will. We\u2019ve talked about back-to-schools, started out fairly slow. Your heard that from retailers it was actually down a little bit; it tended to build strength into September, September being positive. And so we felt good about that trend.","But I think it's a little bit of a show-me holiday at the end of the day, you\u2019ll see we actually refined our overall sales guidance, down just slightly, although Rick will tell you about half of that currency and the other half is just sort of being prudent about what the environment looks like. That said, we feel really good about the overall momentum in our business. Our shares are solid. We're feeling good about our innovation and we\u2019re feeling good about our Innovate-to-Elevate and its ability to drive margins.","Gerald you want to talk about some of the destocking?","Gerald Evans","Sure, as we had anticipated, we did see the $20 million of retail inventory destocking in basics in a major retailer. As we exited the quarter in September we came out with our inventories in line across all of our retailers. And we are now seeing our order patterns really realign to normal patterns against POS. We don't anticipate a further pull down as we look toward the fourth quarter. So we think we\u2019re well positioned. And as Rich said, as the holiday develops we're prepared.","Eric Tracy","Perfect. Then my follow-up I guess for either you, Rich, or maybe Rick. As we think about DB, now the Works Council process behind, starting to integrate, maybe just speak to how that ramp \u2013 the cadence of that ramp for next year. Where are the most \u2013 the earliest opportunities for synergies are to manifest as we move through the year?","Rich Noll","At the end of the day we're tracking right to our expectations as we've talked to you about all along. We said that we expected the Works Council process to be over sometime in the fall, and we'd begin executing in Q4 and Q1 next year. And in terms of the specific ramp up, clearly it is going to ramp up from here. We feel good about our long-term guidance and hitting the \u20ac100 million, operating profit with DBApparel. In terms of specifically, though, we've yet to begun developing our 2016 plans we\u2019ll embark upon that process pretty soon. And will give you a little bit more specific guidance on those \u2013 on the exact ramp up in 2016 on the fourth quarter call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.","Susan Anderson","Good evening, guys; congrats on a really good quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks Susan.","Susan Anderson","I was wondering if you could talk about the intimates. Obviously very strong in the quarter, a nice reversal to see. Is some of that helping driving that is just we\u2019re beyond kind of the SKU rationalization and that's done? Or is it just simply the ebbs and flows as a category that you always talk about and that clearly flowed through this quarter?","Gerald Evans","Yes, Susan, we had a very strong intimates quarter. And a lot of it is putting the drag of the brand consolidation behind us and getting our new initiatives and our brand clarification on the floor. We got \u2013 not only do we get our brands clarified, we were able to get our new initiatives, including the Hanes program, on the floor begin to advertise behind it. They did extremely well out of the gate. In fact all of our core intimates brands did well out of the gate. We advertised behind the ComfortFlex Fit programs, as well and they performed well.","So we feel that we\u2019ve got a lot of positive momentum that the category did show improvement as well. We think we were certainly part of that. We are optimistic about not the future [indiscernible].","Susan Anderson","Great. Then as a follow-up on the Activewear category, obviously very solid margins there. It looks like I2E is really working. Maybe if you could talk about what you're doing different now and what's driving that.","Gerald Evans","Well, from the standpoint of I2E we certainly are continuing to drive same level of innovation through the Activewear business we drive through all of our businesses. The strength of the core Champion brand and in our licensed collegiate apparel business as well are driving a nice margin mix through that business.","Rich Noll","And let me just \u2013 this is Rich. I just want to follow-up and remind everybody. As part of that I2E strategy it's also to drive fewer, bigger platforms, because the bigger they are, they are easier it is to internalize into our supply chain where we can actually capture that extra margin and that\u2019s also a part of that, very much a part of that Activewear strategy. It\u2019s been working extremely well as you can see.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Rich Noll","Hi Joan.","Joan Payson","And congratulations on the great quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","Joan Payson","Just in terms of the intimates outperformance and rebound that you talked about a little bit, could you go into detail a little more on how Maidenform has been performing and how the synergies are tracking with that business?","Gerald Evans","Certainly, Maidenform's integration is performing right on plan. The synergies have developed as we expected. We're internalizing the last of the Maidenform production as we speak and have really moved more to apply our Innovate-to-Elevate against the first designs. The first of those designs actually showed up this fall in department stores as we introduce the ComfortFlex Fit styling into the Maidenform brand. Its early days, but we\u2019re seeing results there. So Maidenform is certainly is performing to our expectations.","Joan Payson","Great. Then just in terms of Champion and the growth that you're seeing into the midtier and some of the new distribution channels, what response have you been getting from the new customer base and the new consumer base going hand-in-hand with that?","Gerald Evans","Well, certainly the best measure is in POS and we\u2019re seeing certainly strong sellthrough of the products we put out there and it really is an expansion of both distribution into new retail accounts, as well as expansion of our space within the accounts we're in, across the men's and the women's lines. And so they are responding well through our designs in our innovation and its selling through very well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys congrats on a nice quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks Michael.","Michael Binetti","Rich, I know you guys did mention that the many years of double-digit EPS growth is still intact. There\u2019s some, I guess, unique push and pull on 2016 as we start to lift our eyes a little bit and just think directionally about that. And one thing in particular might be your longer-term organic growth rate that you talk about of, I think, like 2% to 4%. Can you maybe think about, within the context of getting to double-digit EPS growth next year, is there any big pieces of the composition to getting there that would change versus what we\u2019ve seen the last few years?","Rich Noll","Clearly double-digit EPS growth is our goal as I said earlier and to answer one of the other of questions, we have not begun our planning process at this point, so this is not going to be based on any detailed knowledge. That said, there's no big macro issue that's out there that would suggest the double-digit EPS growth isn\u2019t a reasonable goal for next year. What I like to think of it is with all of our different ways to make money including using our cash, and so on having a goal excluding acquisitions of low-to-mid-teens growth for next year is a good goal for us to have, with acquisitions being on top of that.","Michael Binetti","And then let me ask you about the margins. A similar question, but you've had great success driving the margins. Are the underlying drivers of the margin expansion that we've seen in the last few years intact, between commodities, your innovation platforms, the synergies? Are there some other maybe external factors or competitive forces that would change that algorithm a little bit in the near term?","Rich Noll","There is always lots of puts and takes and what I would call tactical dynamics going on whether it's slight commodity tailwinds or pricing dynamics or this that and the other thing. But there is no fundamental change of what's going on in the competitive landscape from what I see. So we feel good about our strategies. They've been working and they\u2019ll continue to work as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari from Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari","Hey, guys, good afternoon; good quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Taposh.","Taposh Bari","I was hoping you could provide some more detail around point-of-sale across main categories, particularly basics, intimates, and Champion.","Gerald Evans","Sure. If we look first at basics, as Rich touched on in some comments earlier, the back-to-school period we've just finished we saw it start slow but actually strengthen nicely coming into the September period and the true start of school, and has maintained that momentum. So we feel good about the basics business. Certainly from an intimates standpoint we've seen POS respond as our shipments and our new products have gotten in place.","And on the Champion side certainly we've seen strong POS. The strong growth can only be delivered if it's followed by strong POS, and we\u2019re certainly seen both of those come through. So it's good. The market is slowly moving it appears, but it's moving in the right direction overall, and a category like Activewear grows a bit faster.","Taposh Bari","Good to see. And then just another one on the mass point, so it's nice to see the destocking issue being stable now, but there's also a lot of attention associated within the media on some of your retail partners possibly turning to vendors to help fund some of their investments and possibly investing in price. Can you comment on how that plays into your plans, and if that is a material effect?","Gerald Evans","Yes, we're constantly having various discussions with our retailers on a number of things, from promotion programs to allowances to pricing and those kinds of things. But there's nothing that's being discussed that would have a material impact on our business or impact our ability to deliver our guidance.","Rich Noll","Yes, if I could just make a comment, Taposh, you're asking about specifically based on some things that you're hearing in the press and so on and so forth. But generically I've actually had this question asked for me constantly over the last decade, to be honest, about \u2013 you've got large retailers, you\u2019re smaller, how can you actually make sure that you can earn your fair share. And at the end of the day, our strategy is all about building great strong brands, connecting with our consumers, driving innovation. And if we do that, we can help our retail partners drive their average unit ring up and help them make their space more productive, help them make more money. And if we're taking care of that the conversations are always going to go very well. And that\u2019s our focus, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing and that\u2019s where we will continue to stay the course.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva","Great, thanks so much; and congratulations on really great results.","Rich Noll","Thanks, Anna.","Anna Andreeva","A follow-up on Activewear. Just curious if you could talk about what is driving that acceleration in the Champion brand. Is it more points of distribution, any additional product categories that you can share with us, or innovation in the pipeline as we think about 2016? And any commentary on October sellthrough, to the degree that the business is weather-sensitive? There's been some weather comments from retailers. Thanks.","Gerald Evans","Certainly from the standpoint of the expansion in Activewear it's all of the things you listed. Certainly we're getting new distribution, but we're also expanding our footprint as we get into adjacent categories in the space within the accounts we're in. And we're certainly continuing to drive new designs and innovation through the business to drive it further. All that's working extremely well, as you noted in the numbers themselves.","So I think from that standpoint everything is moving very well in the business.","Rich Noll","Weather, in terms of weather, let me tell you with a 20-year history and Gerald will vouch for this \u2013 you want it to get cold sometime between October 5 and October 15. And it seemed like that happened in the United States this year, and that's a good thing. Whether it holds or not, I will let you predict the weather. But that's a good place for it to get cold, and it did.","Anna Andreeva","And thanks guys, good luck.","Gerald Evans","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen and Company.","John Kernan","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on register on quarter.","Rich Noll","Thanks.","John Kernan","You mentioned the synergy benefits will ramp from DBA in 2016. Can you talk about the future acquisition platform in Europe, and how big that market is, and the acquisition environment over in Europe?","Rich Noll","We've said that as we integrate DBA and get it fully integrated into Haynes brands. It\u2019s still a pretty fragmented market throughout Europe and a lot of our categories, where you\u2019ve got local brands, with companies that are sub-scale. And so we believe that will provide a nice platform for future acquisitions in Europe in our core categories, to then integrate that into that larger platform; and by extension it gets integrated into the full HBI global supply chain and IT infrastructure. So we think that is going to be a great platform in the future.","Now that said, we need to focus on getting the integration really moving over the next year or two to create that platform. But there\u2019s a lot of long-term potential.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks; that's helpful. Then just the housekeeping question. It looks like your cash flow from operations guidance was a little bit lower this year than it was coming out of the second quarter. Is there any type of inventory build we should be expecting that's going into the 2016? What's driving that down?","Rick Moss","Sure. It's actually a couple of things. We had mentioned the retail inventory destocking slowed sales a little bit. The other thing with inventory is that as we continue to internalize production for our acquisitions we are seeing a little bit higher raw material and WIP, that\u2019s temporary. This will correct itself as we get into 2016. And so really it\u2019s just a shift of cash from 2015 to 2016. Nothing to worry about.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone. Good afternoon; let me add my congrats. Just a real quick question as we're building our models for 2016. I know that earlier this year you guys had commented that you put some hedges in place that would minimize the trends, I believe, the transaction risks associated with the euro, given that 15% roughly of your business is in Europe right now. Can you talk about when those hedges roll off? Is there anything we should think about from either a margin or sales perspective as we get into 2016?","Rich Noll","Yes, so let me remind you. This is Rich. Just give you the big picture and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick to talk to your specific question. What we were doing is that making sure we were hedging out the transaction risk long enough so that we could then implement the price increases. And in Europe, especially in some of the major economies they tend to happen are tied to the retailer\u2019s fiscal year. And so in terms of the hedges I\u2019ll let Rick talk about that and then Gerald will talk a little bit about the price increase progress.","Rick Moss","Yes, I would add to what Rich said is, that the hedges run through essentially through early next year. Again, our hedging strategy whether its currency or cotton, our hedging strategy is to give the business enough runway to where can react to changes like this through appropriate pricing actions.","Gerald Evans","And certainly the way you protect your margin and then in the long run as you go out and price for the impact of currency changing. That\u2019s in our plan that we are out working with retailers now to have those in place for spring of 2016. That\u2019s going well.","Ike Boruchow","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole","Hey good afternoon.","Rich Noll","Hey, Jay.","Jay Sole","You mentioned the Knights Apparel mix shift impact on gross margin. Can you just talk about a couple of other factors that might have just impacted gross margin one way or other in the quarter? And I\u2019m thinking of FX, maybe your direct business in terms of sales in that channel, cotton, and maybe just pricing overall.","Rich Noll","There\u2019s always the normal puts and takes from the quarter. We did see some benefits on the quarter on gross margin from a little bit lower cotton costs. So but it was \u2013 but honestly it was the usual cast of characters that continue to drive our margin performance, which is Innovate-to-Elevate manufacturing savings, synergies, and the operating profit margin leveraging SG&A.","Jay Sole","Okay. And then maybe just switching gears, Rich, you mentioned acquisitions. Does the fact that [indiscernible] programs are over and the trends, the integration is going well, does that accelerate the timeline for when you think you might be able to take on another integration project, looking out into next year?","Rich Noll","As actually I think I said recently on a call, we\u2019re always out there looking for an acquisition and talking to people is not something that you just decide one day, okay, let\u2019s go do the acquisition. And as we get this integration behind us, we\u2019re going to turn our attention towards 2016 and thinking about an acquisition. It does take a number of things to fall into place to make sure that a deal can get done. You need a willing seller and you need great synergies. And when we get a deal done and we sign it, we\u2019ll let you know.","Jay Sole","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thanks; hello, everyone.","Rich Noll","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy","A couple of related questions. For the fourth quarter, you guys are calling for strong operating margin improvement. I\u2019m curious, is that a function of gross margin opportunities, or is it more reflective of SG&A leverage?","Rick Moss","Jim, it\u2019s really both. We have a strong long track record of leveraging SG&A. We expect to continue to do that in the fourth quarter and we expect to see nice gross margin in the fourth quarter as well.","Jim Duffy","Okay, helpful. And then big picture margin question. So Rich, we\u2019re looking at 2015 EBIT margins north of mid-teens \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry in the mid-teens. Clearly, you have a number of ongoing opportunities with DBA and Knights. How do you think about the structural capacity for operating margins to continue to improve?","Rich Noll","I look at our overall business and how well our innovation in our brands are resonating with consumers. That\u2019s going extremely well. I look at the efficiency of our supply chain. And remember because we\u2019re one of the few companies out there that is totally is mainly vertical, we get to capture those efficiencies for us and our shareholders. And I think we\u2019ve got a philosophy of continuous improvement, and you\u2019ll see that philosophy play out over time.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JP Morgan.","Carla Casella","Hi, I\u2019m wondering if you have a sense of where you\u2019re taking \u2013 who you\u2019re taking share from? Or is it that you\u2019re getting more special programs from the retailers, or where you\u2019re gaining the most shelf space?","Rich Noll","Is there a specific category that you're focused on with the share question?","Carla Casella","Well, I was thinking mostly in the sportswear.","Rich Noll","So in the Activewear side of things. Certainly we've seen that the Champion brand is positioning itself as a strong number three to two in that category sort of it is better positioned in the market. Again, there is certainly shares that\u2019s come from Adidas and other players in the market as we\u2019ve climbed up into that market.","Carla Casella","Is it in a certain category of retail, though \u2013 meaning mass versus department store?","Rich Noll","The share we are gaining now is largely in that sports specialty and department store channel.","Carla Casella","Okay, great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to T C Robillard for any closing comments.","T C Robillard","Thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for attending our call today. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great night.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"11083":["Hanesbrands, Inc.

Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands Quarterly Investor Conference Call and Webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the third quarter of 2017. Hopefully everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.

These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.

While not speaking today, we are also joined by Barry Hytinen, who as you know, recently joined Hanesbrands as our Chief Financial Officer. Gerald and Rick will provide some brief remarks, and then we will open it up to your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you, T.C. Hanesbrands delivered a solid third quarter performance with revenue and earnings per share right in line with our guidance and cash flow from operations year-to-date $120 million ahead of last year. While the quarter came together a little differently than we expected, the end result was that we delivered on our guidance, we returned to organic growth and we generated a significant amount of cash flow. Our business model has become increasingly diversified as it offers multiple paths for delivering growth and long-term shareholder returns, even with the challenges of the U.S. market. In fact, we saw three key points in the quarter that demonstrate our diversified model is working","First, we continue to generate greater amounts of cash flow. We are recognizing synergies from acquisitions, the associated integration expenses are declining, we are improving our working capital and Project Booster is ramping on schedule. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver at least the midpoint of our cash flow guidance for the year and on our goal of a $1 billion run rate as we exit 2019.","Second, we believe we have approached an inflection point in our business where our key growth strategies, specifically online, Champion and international, have reached sufficient scale to more than offset the challenges in the U.S. retail market. As expected, we delivered organic growth in the quarter, both as reported and in constant currency. Online sales increased at a high 20% rate with growth across all regions, all channels and all product categories. Global Champion sales increased 16% in the quarter, which was an acceleration from the high single-digit rate we delivered in the first half. And we saw solid growth in Innerwear sales in Australia and in Latin America.","The third point demonstrating our diversified model works is that our past acquisitions are delivering incremental benefits. The concept of multiyear synergy contributions from our acquisitions is well understood. But what I believe is being overlooked is how these acquisitions are helping drive our long-term organic growth, as many of these are fast-growing businesses. Moreover, our acquisitions are diversifying our revenue base, both geographically and by product category allowing us to increasingly leverage our global supply chain operations.","With over 30% of our sales outside of the U.S., across more than 90 different countries, we are truly a global company. So let me take a minute to discuss our business performance by global product category. For the quarter, global Activewear, which represents roughly 40% of our sales, increased 5% over last year while global Innerwear sales declined roughly 60 basis points. Regionally we saw similar trends between product categories. International sales were stronger than expected, driven by double-digit Champion growth in both Europe and Asia, as well as solid growth in Innerwear sales in Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.","This was partially offset by weaker than expected Innerwear and Activewear sales in the U.S. as continued declines in the overall Apparel category and poor traffic trends resulted in broad based weakness at retail during the back-to-school season. Nonetheless, in the quarter, we held share in basics and saw improving POS trends within our bra business at certain key accounts in spite of the challenging market environment. As I mentioned earlier, we are encouraged that our online, Champion and international businesses are now large enough to more than offset these challenges and allowed us to return to organic sales growth in the quarter.","Touching briefly on acquisitions, we announced the purchase of Alternative Apparel in mid-October. This acquisition supports our Activewear growth strategy by providing us with another distinctive growth brand and additional channels of distribution. We expect this deal to deliver an after-tax unlevered IRR of at least 20%. Add these returns to the roughly $85 million of remaining acquisition synergies and approximately $100 million of net cost savings from Project Booster, and we believe we are extremely well-positioned to deliver profit and cash flow growth over the next several years.","So in summary, all of our efforts and investments over the past several years are delivering their intended results. We have diversified our revenue, we are returning to organic growth, our cash flow is building and Project Booster is ramping. We believe all of this positions us for continued growth in 2018 and beyond.","Before I turn the call over, I'd like to thank Rick for all of his guidance, support and contributions to this organization over the past 12 years. And in particular, his partnership over the past year as I transition to CEO. We wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.","I'd also like to welcome Barry Hytinen who, as you know, joined us two weeks ago as our CFO. Barry brings a breadth of experience and skill-sets that match the needs of Hanesbrands, and we are very excited he is here.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Gerald. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Hanesbrands. It truly is a world class organization with great brands and an unmatched culture. I'm honored to have had a hand in our successful strategies over the past 12 years from Innovate-to-Elevate to our acquisition and capital allocation strategy to Project Booster. These strategies have driven significant returns for our shareholders over the past decade through a variety of different end market environments. More importantly, they've remade Hanesbrands to be successful for the next decade, irrespective of the current challenges in the U.S. market.","We're investing in areas of growth which has resulted in a much more diversified revenue base with over 30% of our sales now outside the U.S., roughly 40% of our sales coming from Activewear products and nearly 20% of our sales coming from online and our own retail operations.","Combine our revenue diversification with visible profit and cash flow drivers, such as our remaining acquisition synergies, and Project Booster savings, and we're confident in our ability to further expand our margins and to deliver on our cash flow goal of an annual run rate of $1 billion as we exit 2019.","Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter. Sales increased more than 2% over last year, driven by organic growth in the base business and roughly $15 million from acquisition contributions. As expected, gross margin improved over last year, increasing 20 basis points to 37.8%, driven by efficiency gains within our supply chain. Operating margin of 15% declined 40 basis points versus last year due primarily to a higher mix of international sales. Recall, international margins are expected to be temporarily lower as we have yet to recognize full synergies from prior acquisitions. By business, our margins remain strong, and this was evident in the year-over-year expansion in all of our segment margins in the quarter.","The tax rate was 2% as a result of higher profit in lower tax jurisdictions and our normal third quarter discrete items related to adjustments of prior year tax returns. And earnings per share of $0.60 was at the midpoint of our guidance range and included a $0.01 per share drag from the impact of hurricanes in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico.","Looking at our domestic segments, as Gerald highlighted, we experienced weaker than expected market trends within the U.S. And this was apparent in our Innerwear and Activewear segment results. Innerwear sales declined from last year as online sales growth of over 20% was more than offset by pressure within brick and mortar. Back-to-school trends broadly across retail channels were softer than expected, driven by weak traffic and continued declines in the overall apparel category.","We were certainly disappointed that Innerwear sales did not progress as we were expecting in the quarter as a result of these market pressures. However, we were able to hold that share in basics and we saw improving POS trends within our Bra business at certain key accounts. Innerwear's operating margin increased 10 basis points over last year as Booster savings more than offset the declining sales volume.","With respect to our Activewear segment, sales increased slightly over last year due to the addition of GTM and double-digit Champion growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels. Activewear's operating margin expanded 110 basis points over last year, driven by product mix and Booster savings.","Switching to our International segment, as Gerald also highlighted, sales were much stronger than expected in the quarter, increasing roughly 14% in constant currency. Sales in Europe increased 7% in constant currency, driven by Champion growth in both the wholesale and retail channels, with particular strength in Germany and the UK. Within Hanes Europe, sales of our DIM brand increased while online sales were up double digits. Sales in Asia increased over 20% in constant currency due to strong Champion growth across all channels in Japan as well as double-digit Champion growth in Korea. Hanes Australasia also delivered strong growth across both wholesale and consumer directed channels.","In Latin America, sales increased over 15% in constant currency, driven by positive Innerwear POS trends in Mexico, the relaunch of Maidenform in Argentina and Innerwear sales in Brazil. Segment operating margin of 13.7% increased 90 basis points over last year driven by sales growth and acquisition synergies.","With respect to balance sheet and cash flow highlights, inventory declined roughly 3% over last year in Q3, while cash flow from operations year-to-date improved by $123 million. All year we have built our cash flow at a faster pace than last year through the combination of net income growth and structural improvements in our working capital.","Turning to guidance, we narrowed our full year outlook, so please refer to our Press Release and FAQ document for the specific details. As we highlighted with our quarterly guidance back in August, our full-year sales outlook has been tracking to the low end of our range, given the challenging apparel market trends within the U.S.","With respect to EPS, we narrowed our range to reflect increased marketing investments to drive market share, a higher mix of international sales relative to our prior expectations, as well as a $0.02 per share drag from the unexpected impact of the Sears Canada bankruptcy and the natural disasters I referred to earlier. And lastly, we expect cash flow from operations to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.","So to wrap up, we believe we have approached an inflection point in our business. Our growth initiatives are now large enough to offset current market challenges. You saw this in Q3 as we delivered on our guidance and returned to organic growth, and we believe you'll see this in Q4 as we expect to deliver another quarter of organic revenue growth.","Looking forward, when you add visible profit and cash flow drivers to this revenue inflection, we believe we are very well-positioned to drive strong shareholder returns for the next several years.","And with, that I'll turn the call back over to T.C.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single follow up, and then re-enter the queue to ask any additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Rick, all the best to you and welcome, Barry. If I could, Gerald, was hoping you could speak to some of the assumptions for the 4Q guide. Looks like organic revs expected to accelerate a bit at least at the midpoint just up north of 2% at the low end, close to 4% at the high end. I know you're lapping the destocking from last year, and it looks like FX is going to contribute about a point. But just given the challenges at back-to-school, maybe you could provide a little bit more color on your assumptions around domestic wholesale, for holiday would be great.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. And first and foremost, we do expect to continue to see organic growth in Q4 and actually building upon what we saw in Q3. And I think certainly you saw the power of our diverse model through our online growth in the high 20% growth range, again, as well as our Champion growth in the 16% range, and International coming in at 14% on constant currency.","As you noted, as we look to the fourth quarter, we've guided all year, cautiously in regard to the U.S. business, as to how we would expect it to play out. And we haven't anticipated the typical retail builds that we would have seen as we move toward the holiday period. We do overlap though a destocking that we went through last year. And so year-on-year we do expect to see an increase as we overlap that destocking in spite of not assuming the retail holiday builds. That will give us some growth in the U.S. business as well, and it contributes to that total organic growth in the period.","And while some of that, the biggest weeks are still ahead of us, we're encouraged that we are in the right track. We see that October is actually beginning to play out nicely and normalize in the U.S., which gives us further confidence in our guidance for the period. You were correct in noting that there is some FX and it's about a point of that guidance as well. But when we see all these trends coming together and the fact that we've got added marketing support behind the business, much of that in the U.S. market, and much of that behind our innovation platforms like FreshIQ, we feel good about the guidance and the further acceleration.","Eric Tracy - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then if I could just follow up. I mean, clearly the model is becoming more diversified with international and digital. Maybe you could speak \u2013 you said it, it's scaled to the point where it now is able to offset, but maybe just speak to the investments that still need to be made? Maybe talk just a little bit about international, when that potentially leverages and becomes incrementally accretive?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, we see it leveraging now from the standpoint of its growth in several of our acquisitions. While we've always talked about them more from a cost synergy justification, several of those acquisitions on the international side are actually fast-growth businesses as well. Certainly the Australian, as well as the Champion Europe businesses were faster growth than our domestic businesses, and both grow at mid-single-digit kind of growth rates. You certainly see that coming through on the international side, as well as our Asia businesses continue to deliver nice strong growth and a lot of that's coming out of our global Champion initiative as that intersects with our international expansion.","So we are seeing that scale and we now have platforms in most of the key geographies to build upon it. And so we think we can scale that further as we build out with our acquisition strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And best wishes to Rick also. I guess, first I wanted to touch on the Innerwear category. Did you say both men's and women's were down in the quarter? And then maybe give some color on how the FreshIQ is selling and if that's helping to drive sales. And also the market share I believe does held there, does that include online?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","You're breaking up a little bit. I think I got most of the question. So let me start. You ask about the Innerwear category and the domestic Innerwear category and how it played out. And frankly, let me just take you up a little higher, first of all, to the standpoint that we saw weak results across U.S. brick and mortar period, from the standpoint of retail performance and I mean the industry. And it weighed on the total apparel category as it was weak across all channels and apparel category in total was actually in decline in the quarter. And this is the back-to-school quarter so it's a big apparel category quarter from that standpoint. That weighed on our categories as well, and we saw declines in our Innerwear business, and it wasn't to one gender or the other, it weighed as a result of total traffic. So we saw it fall that way.","We did continue to see our shares hold in our basics categories, for example, which is one of the areas you were pointing to with your question. And I do believe some of that's related to our FreshIQ and the initiatives behind that as well.","We also saw that the inventories as we exited the quarter were in good shape and, as I noted in my prior comments, we see as we're getting into October that things are normalizing and we believe that's a good sign as we begin to put our marketing efforts behind it that we'll continue to see positive trends, particularly as we overlap that destocking that we experienced in the fourth quarter last year.","Susan K. Anderson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. That sounds good. And just one follow up on the Activewear side. How do you guys see the growth for Champion and C9 kind of as you look out? I think there's some concern out there that it could be impacted by Nike and Under Armour promoting so much. Have you seen any impact do you believe? And how should we think about what you're expecting for growth in the U.S. going forward?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes. I'll start with that as a global question, and then I'll bring it down to the domestic market because I think first of all, on a global basis, our global Activewear business was up 5% in the quarter. And as you heard earlier, our Champion business globally was up 16%, really driving it. And so we're bullish on the Activewear category globally. We see very solid growth in the category and we see a lot of potential as we look even to the fourth quarter. Specific to the domestic market, our core Champion business was up 20% in our sporting goods and department store mid tiers. We now have the TSA bankruptcy behind us and we saw nice growth in our Sports License Apparel business as well.","We did experience some headwinds in the mass channel as we saw the total apparel category experience some headwinds in the quarter. But as we look now toward the fourth quarter, we anticipate sequentially improving organic trends driven by Champion and our Sports Apparel business. And on a global basis, we expect the kind of growth we've seen or better as we look to Q4. So we see very positive trends globally as well as in our domestic Champion business that will be then complemented by our recent acquisition of Alternative Apparel in the U.S. market.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Burns with D.A. Davidson.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon. And just a follow up on the Champion, congratulations on the acceleration in the quarter there. As referenced earlier, given all the negative news flow here in the U.S., could you spend a little more time about what those Champion and what those Activewear international growth opportunities are, whether it's more SKUs, broader distribution, what's the long-term picture look like there?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure, Andrew. Andrew, from the standpoint of Champion, I think you know this story, but we've not only been driving it domestically but as part of our acquisition strategy, we've actually reassembled the brand globally, or assembled the brand globally for the first time in some period of time. So as we've done that, it's given us a broad group of geographies to build the business in. And so we're driving it now globally, we have a lot of opportunity in Europe and we're driving in Europe both through the Italian business that we purchased but also up in the Northern Europe.","We're seeing very positive trends across Asia as we now push it up into Southeast Asia as well as develop it in Japan and even now some into China. And then in the domestic business is there's potential to continue to develop it in the sporting goods channel as well in the department and mid-tier channel. And we've got a very solid mass business as well. So it's geography as well as additional distribution in our core channels.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. And then a question on the incremental marketing investments in the fourth quarter. Can you speak about the timing and the opportunity you see. As well as the focus primarily on U.S. Innerwear, which is sort of a tough category where you're maintaining share versus putting those incremental dollars into growing categories globally? Thanks.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. The increase in media was on a global basis, in marketing support was on a global basis. What I mentioned as a large share of it was in the U.S. market. So we are investing in other businesses outside of the U.S. as well. But we see the clear opportunity to invest behind our innovations as well as to work with some of our customers in our core Intimates businesses as we overlap some challenges to drive business there as well. So we're taking that opportunity to drive that business to drive organic growth within Q4, but also position us for growth in 2018 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. I had a question with regards to marketing too, just in the context of the weaker back-to-school. How much do you think of that was really just general macro brick-and-mortar trends versus maybe a lower level of support for the brand during the quarter?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Oh I think it was macro trends. When you look at the total Apparel category being down and the fact that it was down across multiple channels suggests you've got a macro trend going on and it's for that reason we see as we come out of that and investing behind our brands. And frankly, we held share in that sort of macro trend pressure that we've got a real opportunity to drive our brands.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And if I could ask one unrelated question. How much of the online business now is direct-to-consumer and Amazon versus your brick-and-mortar partner online business?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, what we've seen within the quarter, and we've seen it for some time, is our online business is growing very rapidly globally as I mentioned. We've talked about this for some time. Effectively it's a $600 million business for us on an annualized basis, and it's growing in the high 20% rate around the world. So we've got a nice growing business, and it's actually not only growing across all geographies and all categories, but it's growing across all channels within the online space. So we see similar growth trends now evolving both in our own sites as well as our pure plays and our brick-and-mortar. So it's a nice balanced business that's growing very well unilaterally.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. First question. I just wanted to touch on the cost side of the business. So on one hand, we know you have Booster, which you talked about driving I think $100 million of net savings over the next two years. And now today you're talking about reinvesting some incremental dollars back into marketing and demand creation. So I guess my question is, how should we marry those two things against one another? The cost saves versus the need to, you know drive top line and drive marketing dollars higher?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Hi. This is Gerald. Let me take that. Booster, we always said it was about unleashing the full revenue and cash flow potential of the company. There was certainly a cost reduction piece of that, but we also said we were going to invest a portion of that back into the business to drive our key initiatives. Some of those were online, some of those were getting behind our brands and our key innovations, and so forth. And I think you can view \u2013 as Rick has stated in prior calls, he also stated that we would likely step up our investment faster than we would drive the savings. One would mature faster than the other. We saw the opportunities, we came into Q4 to move a little faster with our investment, and so we've taken that step to help drive our business.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo","Got it. Thanks, Gerald. That's helpful. Just a follow-up question. Was curious if you \u2013 Gerald, if you could talk about just domestic pricing within Innerwear at a high level? Are you seeing anything from a competitive back drop that signals to you that any of your peers are looking to take prices down in order to take any market share? Just any color there? Curious how you're thinking about that?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","We're actually \u2013 from the pricing standpoint, of course, it's early in the holiday season yet. But from what we've seen, pricing's been fairly stable in the core categories, this is a period of time where you do have some promotion activities around the holiday period. And certainly we will be engaged in some of that, but nothing out of the ordinary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more if you could on the Innerwear results. I know back-to-school sounds like the traffic was a little bit sluggish there. Are you seeing the same weather affect that you've seen in the past where kind of the sell-through trends tend to be pretty sensitive of that? Any update on retailer destocking trends and how you're thinking about that going into next year, if that'll still be a drag? Any other kind of context you can put around the U.S. and the Innerwear number, which I know is affected by the U.S. most.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, no, I think when you see Innerwear, Omar, it was really a function of the retail weakness and so forth that we experienced as a category, frankly. With the primary driver certainly from a true weather standpoint, that category is generally less sensitive to weather though at quarter-end on top of a weak period we certainly encountered the impact of the hurricanes and so forth. It did impact our total U.S. business, but no, generally it was more of just the weakness in the Apparel category.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Gotcha. And then, I mean, are you seeing \u2013 do you see similar kind of dynamics going on with the eCommerce piece? Or is it a totally different dynamic on how consumers are buying the category online?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","From the standpoint of growth, certainly online, we saw a very solid performance on the online, in the online space, and as we stated earlier, we continue to see high 20% kind of growth, which is a growth rate far faster than the apparel category is growing online in the U.S., for example. So we continue to hold leading shares, we continue to we believe to consolidate our shares. And I think our efforts are really paying off in helping offset some of the challenges in brick and mortar.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Gotcha. Thanks for the information. Good luck.","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. So you have a 1% to 2% long-term organic growth target. Can you just provide a sense of the timeframe you're thinking about for achieving that level of growth on a consistent basis and how you think about Innerwear, Activewear and international in the context of that goal?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Well, from the standpoint of our guidance, I think that clearly as you look to the fourth quarter, we'd be in that 2% plus organic growth range as you look in Q4 even without the FX. So I think you're seeing that we're guiding in that direction. Now it's being driven more in the near term from our strength in international as well as our success online. As we begin to see the settling out of the U.S. retail challenges, I believe that you'll begin to see it in our \u2013 more and more stability out of our U.S. Innerwear business, as well, it really will continue to cement that 1% to 2% and hopefully move us to the higher end of that range over time.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. And just a quick follow up on back-to-school. Did you see the expected benefit from shipment timing in the quarter and that was just overwhelmed by the other factors or was part of the underperformance that you didn't see those shipments come through as expected?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","I think it's a fair question that with the challenge in the market the way we experienced it, we did not see the added benefit of that coming in the quarter as we'd expected.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Tiffany, your line is open. Could you check your mute button? She may have stepped away from her phone. We'll try again. Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is May on for Carla. Just wondering and checking in on the state of Champion growth and how that's kind of going. And any increased distribution opportunity you guys see there?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Yes, we're really excited about Champion and a key driver in our global Activewear growth is the strong Champion growth. And we're seeing 16% growth globally in the quarter, very solid growth within our core Champion business in the U.S. as well. And it's one of our expected key growth drivers going forward. So we're very bullish on that business. We think we're really just getting started on driving that brand to where it truly can be.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And (33:13) just given recent transactions, is there any update on leverage or targets related to that, that you guys have?","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","So this is Rick (33:33)","Unknown Speaker","Hello? Hello?","Operator","Please stand by.","Unknown Speaker","Hello?","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Please stand by, the conference will resume momentarily. Until then we'll hear music.","[Technical Difficulty] (34:51-36:56)","Operator","And you may resume.","Richard D. Moss - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thanks, Karen. So this is Rick again. As we were saying, since we did our acquisitions last summer, we've been steadily deleveraging our balance sheet. On a net debt to EBITDA basis by the end of the year we should be around three times. When you look at that compared to our \u2013 the capacity we have under our credit agreements, we look to be able to do up to like $1 billion in acquisitions. I'd also note that we ended the quarter with $400 million on our balance sheet and so between that and the cash flow build that we're experiencing right now, we feel like we have plenty of capacity to do acquisitions as we \u2013 as they come up.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll try Tiffany Kanaga from Deutsche Bank again. Your line is open.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I know you touched on it, but can you provide some incremental and more specific color around what's driving the outperformance in international beyond your expectations? Such as in terms of some examples of brands or products that are working exceptionally well? And where do you see the most runway to extend the growth in terms of specific regions, brands or categories?","Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Sure. And there's a couple of elements to that answer. First of all, when we look across the international business in total it was up 14% in the quarter on constant currency. There's very solid growth coming out of the Global Champion initiative, and much of that is coming from our strong performance in our Champion Europe business as well as very strong business in Asia that's being driven by our Champion expansion as well. And we see a lot more runway there to your question to expand even further.","On the Innerwear side, we saw very solid results in Australia which is our acquisition, it's a year old, and it's doing very well. It was a higher growth business when we bought it in the mid-single-digit kind of growth rate. And they're continuing to perform as their combination of driving their own direct-to-consumer business, both through their own stores and online, and a wholesale business, and it's a very nice growth model. And then Latin America, we've seen nice solid performance behind our Innerwear businesses across those regions as well, and we've got opportunity to both expand from a share position, but also into adjacent categories in Latin America.","So you see we've got a nice balance of Activewear expansion in key markets as well as we've got some nice growth coming out of Innerwear in some of other markets that have come through a combination of \u2013 largely through acquisitions tied to some of our original international businesses in Latin America.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Hanesbrands for any closing comments.","T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.","Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for attending our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."]}}
