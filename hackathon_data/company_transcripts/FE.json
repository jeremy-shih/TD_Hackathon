As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Adam, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's fourth quarter earnings call. We will make various forward-looking statements today regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investor section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website. Please note that on the Investor Relations page of our website we have also included a slide presentation that will follow this morning's discussions.","Participating in today's call are Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Donnie Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you're able to join us. I'm excited to share the results from an important and productive year for FirstEnergy. In 2015 we made tremendous progress on major initiatives across our company. We put a number of obstacles behind us and completed critical work necessary to implement our regulated growth strategy going forward. At the same time, we consistently met our financial commitments to you. Last night we reported operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.71 per share for the year.","These results, which reflect improved operations at our Competitive business, as well as growth in our Transmission business are above our initial guidance range for 2015, and in line with the revised estimates that we provided during our third quarter call despite the mild weather we experienced in the fourth quarter.","For the first quarter of 2016, we have provided operating earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. As we will discuss later, we intend to provide additional guidance once we have an outcome in our Ohio Electric Security Plan. Before we move to Jim's financial review, I'll take a few minutes to discuss the key events from 2015. First, we removed regulatory uncertainty and important steps to position our regulated utilities for growth with the conclusion of rate cases in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Resolving these cases allows us to plan for additional infrastructure and reliability investments at those utilities.","In Pennsylvania, we took that next step by filing Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plans for each of our four operating companies in October. These plans, which were approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission last week, outline a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over five years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. Yesterday, we filed for approval to implement a distribution system improvement charge at each of the four operating companies, which will allow us to recover quarterly costs associated with the capital projects approved in the LTIIPs.","In Ohio, we achieved an important milestone for our latest Electric Security Plan by reaching a settlement agreement with the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and 16 other parties, including EnerNOC, an energy management solutions provider, Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, a low income customer advocacy group, and IGS Energy, an independent energy supplier. The agreement outlines the ambitious steps to safeguard Ohio customers against retail price increases and volatility in future years, deploy new energy efficiency programs, and provide a clear path to a cleaner energy future by reducing carbon emissions.","Our settlement includes an eight-year retail rate stability rider associated with the proposed Purchased Power Agreement. This provision will help protect customers against rising retail prices and market volatility while helping preserve vital base load power plants that serve Ohio customers and provide thousands of jobs in the state. The PPA includes the Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Oak Harbor, Ohio, which recently received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license extension, and a portion of the output of two OVEC plants.","The procedural schedule for our Ohio case is nearly complete, with hearings concluded, initial briefs filed, and reply briefs due next Friday. A decision from the PUCO is expected in March.","Clearly, there is a lot of talk about the PPA as all interested parties seek to have their voices heard. We firmly believe that our plan serves the best interests of Ohio customers and Ohio communities while supporting competitive markets in the state and PJM. This generation will continue to be offered into PJM's energy and capacity markets, and the PPA will have no impact on our standard service offer or customers' ability to shop for their retail electric supply.","In fact, we expect that the output from these plants will be treated no differently than the 20% of regulated generation that currently clears in the PJM markets, and that 20% does not include imports into PJM, which from MISO would be primarily regulated generation. I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about the legal and regulatory process, and Leila's standing by to share our perspective during the Q&A. We believe our plan is the right one for Ohio, and we remain very optimistic in the outcome, both in Ohio and at FERC.","Let's turn to our Transmission business. We just passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future, transmission investment initiative to meet the reliability needs of our customers and communities. We remain on track to meet our target of $4.2 billion in spending during the 2014 through 2017 timeframe. Consistent with our plan, we spent $2.4 billion in 2014 and 2015, including $986 million last year, on projects to address service reliability, grid modernization and growth.","We completed major initiatives to address last year's Northeast Ohio plant deactivations, and brought online critical new infrastructure to support midstream gas operations in our region. Work in 2016 is expected to include $1 billion in investments on projects such as synchronous condensers at our Eastlake Plant, new line construction projects in West Virginia and New Jersey, Static Var Compensator projects in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia, and several new substations, line rebuilds and reconductoring projects.","While expansion in the shale markets has cooled, we expect investments over the next several years of about $150 million for work that is already in the pipeline. We also addressed several matters in 2015 that support future investment in this important long-term growth platform. During the fourth quarter, FERC approved our settlement for a forward-looking formula rate structure at our ATSI subsidiary which permits more timely recovery of our investments. In addition, in June we filed to create a new subsidiary named Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission, or MAIT. This subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for those customers. Our proposal is on FERC's agenda for tomorrow and we are seeking approval from both the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities by the middle of the year.","These structural changes are important steps to ensure timely recovery of our investments and set the stage for continued growth through our Energizing the Future transmission initiative.","Turning to our Competitive operations, the PJM capacity market reforms approved by FERC have already begun to have a positive impact on the capacity auction process, although the markets continue to fall well short of being compensatory for long-lived capital assets like base load generation units. Our revised competitive strategy, focusing on stabilizing the business by reducing risk, also produced positive results.","In 2015, we sold 75 million megawatt-hours while significantly reducing our exposure to weather-sensitive load and executing a rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. As a result, we mitigated the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2015 and achieved adjusted EBITDA of $949 million. This is in line with the revised guidance that we provided in October and reflects solid operational results as well as the impact of our Cash Flow Improvement Project. We are holding off on providing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 and 2018 until our Analyst Meeting following the PUCO decision in Ohio. However, we are reaffirming both our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the Competitive business of $950 million to $1.05 billion, and our expectation that the business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018.","Before I move from our Competitive segment, I'll mention that given the significant decline in the global coal market, we impaired our investment in the Signal Peak mine, resulting in a $362 million pre-tax noncash charge, which Jim will cover in more detail.","Finally, I'll spend a few moments discussing our Cash Flow Improvement Plan and other financial matters. We took a very important step to improve our financial metrics and balance sheet in 2015 through the launch of the Cash Flow Improvement Project. This initiative began in the spring, with a goal to capture meaningful and sustainable savings opportunities and process improvements across the company while continuing to fully meet the needs of our customers, our organization and our employees. I'm very pleased with the results of this effort to-date. We are on track to capture $155 million in savings this year and $240 million annually by 2017, up from our initial goal of $200 million over the timeframe. The results from this initiative will allow us to essentially hold our O&M flat through 2017.","We put a lot of risk behind us in 2015, including key initiatives that provide our company with greater strength and flexibility as we pursue our regulated growth plans. I'm also gratified by the response from the rating agencies. In December, citing our shift in strategy and more credit friendly business risk profile, Fitch revised its outlook from stable to positive. Days later, Moody's affirmed its Baa3 rating with a stable outlook for FirstEnergy Corp., FES and Allegheny Energy Supply, citing our Ohio ESP settlement.","Over the past year, I've gotten to know many of you and I've shared my leadership philosophy, including my commitment to make our company more transparent. I hope you've seen that in action over the past year. I've told you one of our primary objectives is to improve the quality of our earnings. This year, two significant noncash adjustments got in the way. The annual mark-to-market for pension and OPEB will remain an annual adjustment, either up or down, and the impairment of the Signal Peak coal mine is required, given the current market for coal and the fact that this isn't a core asset for us.","Outside of these two items, earnings quality in 2015 was very solid, and is supported with operational cash flows that showed a $700 million improvement over 2014. We are making solid progress, and once we have an outcome in our Ohio ESP, we should be in a position to provide 2016 full-year earnings expectations and shed more light on the next couple of years, including our regulated growth projections and any future equity needs to support our growth initiatives.","It remains our priority to continue strengthening our balance sheet and further de-risk our Competitive business. These steps will help ensure we are well positioned to pursue the next period of regulated growth and success, benefiting our 6 million customers and the local economies we serve, our investors and our employees.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter. As always, we reserved plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.","Our fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.58 per share compares to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a loss of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.73 per share during the same period last year.","2015 fourth quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $1.11 per share. I'll spend a few moments on two of those items before moving to the review of operating results.","The first of these is the impairment charge related to our investment in the Signal Peak mine. As Chuck mentioned earlier on the call, given the weak market for coal globally, in the fourth quarter we wrote off our investment in Global Holding, the parent company of Signal Peak, resulting in a noncash pre-tax charge of $362 million or $0.56 per share, which reduced the value of this investment to zero.","As some of you may remember, back in 2011, FirstEnergy sold a portion of its ownership interest in Signal Peak, receiving $258 million in cash proceeds and recognizing a $370 million after-tax gain which included a sizeable step-up in the one-third interest we retained. Presently, the mine remains operational and FirstEnergy continues to provide a full guarantee on Global Holding's $300 million term loan. Since this investment is no longer a strategic fit for FirstEnergy, we have moved the earnings associated with Signal Peak from our Competitive segment to Corporate\/Other for all periods.","The second special item is the $0.35 per share annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, another noncash item. As discussed in our third quarter call, we anticipated this charge given the plan's investment performance, which was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. I will note that for 2016 we have $381 million in required minimum pension funding, with $160 million already contributed to the plan last month.","Let's spend some time walking through the fourth quarter drivers by business units, followed by a brief review of the full year. In our Distribution business total deliveries decreased 6% in the quarter or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. Residential sales decreased 10.6% and commercial sales decreased 3.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our region saw the mildest fourth quarter temperatures in at least 35 years, with heating degree days that were nearly 30% below both last year and normal. The decrease in customer use also reflects the adoption of energy efficient lighting and the impact of other energy efficiency measures. We continue to analyze these efficiency trends and we plan to discuss the expected impact on our load forecast over the next few years when we hold our Analyst Meeting.","Sales to industrial customers decreased 3.9% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, mining, chemical, electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. Distribution results were also impacted by higher operating expenses, which included planned reliability spend in the quarter, primarily at JCP&L.","In our Transmission business fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which became effective in January 2015, partially offset by a lower return on equity at ATSI as part of its comprehensive settlement that was approved by FERC in October.","In our Competitive business, we recorded strong fourth quarter operating earnings as higher commodity margin was offset with higher operating expenses. The impact of lower contract sales was offset by higher capacity revenues, lower purchased power, fuel and transmission expenses, and increased sales to the wholesale market, reflecting our more open position. Operating costs for the Competitive business were higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the nuclear refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2.","Finally, at Corporate, a higher effective income tax rate and higher interest and operating expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.08, in line with our expectations.","Now I'll take a couple of minutes to discuss full year results and review the key earnings drivers for 2015. Operating earnings were $2.71 per share compared to $2.56 in 2014. GAAP earnings were $1.37 per share in 2015 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. At our Regulated Distribution utilities, 2015 operating earnings were in line with our guidance. The net benefit of resolved rate cases and generally favorable weather was offset primarily by higher operating expenses associated with planned reliability maintenance. Total distribution deliveries decreased about 1% compared to 2014. In the Industrial segment sales declined primarily due to decreased steel and mining production. Sales to residential and commercial customers were essentially flat compared to the prior year.","In the Regulated Transmission segment, operating earnings increased primarily as a result of a higher rate base and a forward-looking rate structure at ATSI in the company's Regulated Transmission business. In our Competitive business, operating earnings increased significantly, primarily due to improved commodity margin related to higher capacity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $949 million in line with our expectations. You'll recall that we began the effort to reposition our sales portfolio in the second quarter of 2014. Our total retail customer count at the end of 2015 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 445,000 customers from December 31, 2014. We sold about 75 million megawatt hours in 2015, including 68 million megawatt hours of contract sales and an additional 7 million megawatt hours of wholesale.","We currently have about 61 million megawatt hours committed for 2016 and for 2017 about 38 million megawatt hours are committed, or about half of our expected generation resources. The Ohio PPA would add approximately 23 million megawatt hours on an annual basis, which would essentially close our sales positions through the first half of 2017. In the Corporate segment, 2015 operating earnings were consistent with our guidance, reflecting higher interest and operating expenses as well as a more normal effective income tax rate.","2015 should be recognized as a pivotal year for our company. We were able to raise the operating earnings guidance that we provided, reduce risk and build a solid platform for regulated growth. We're confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal of creating long-term value for FirstEnergy shareholders.","Now I'd like to open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to discuss transmission spending opportunities. In your fact book I think it's slide 45, you talk about a review of the reliability in your ATSI system. And maybe that should be phrased more broadly, but just wanted to check-in in terms of as you assess transmission needs, replacement of 69-kV lines, 138-kV lines, what is your sense in terms of the potential for additional spending to enhance reliability in transmission in particular?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Stephen, we've talked about this a little bit in the past. Our team has identified in excess of $15 billion worth of projects that we could execute, all on our existing 24,000 miles of transmission lines. And that's our focus. And what we do with those projects is we prioritize them in the best way to drive benefits for customers. And my view is the best investments we can make are the ones that customers are willing to pay for and that you all are willing to invest in. So the opportunity is there for us to make these kind of investments for a long time; the ability to add on an annual basis to that is a little bit challenged by the availability of a transmission construction work force in our country.","So I wouldn't expect that you would see a huge increase on an annual basis, but you could extrapolate out quite a bit into the future how long we can continue to execute this program.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. That makes sense. And wanted to shift over to the Ohio PPA discussions. I'm sure there will be many questions on this. At the FERC level, I guess comments are due February 23 or thereabouts, and I know this is obviously not your preferred outcome, but if the FERC case were to go in opposition to the PPAs, could you talk a little bit about what the implications might be, understanding again that that's not your preferred outcome?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Oh hi, Stephen. This is Leila. So I don't think it would be the likely outcome either, but \u2013 so let me spend a couple of seconds just kind of recount for the group what that would have actually entailed to get to that place.","So right now we have an affiliate waiver and the basis upon which it was granted, those items have not changed. If you think about it, Ohio still, the customers are not captive. They can shop. There hasn't been a law change. That means that the Ohio Commission is still in order to approve the PPA would have to find that the ESP is better than the MRO. They would still be protecting customers. So if you look at those kind of things, again I don't think that it's something that the FERC should rescind, if you would.","But if they were to do that, what would happen \u2013 they would likely apply the Edgar rule. So you could look at the different provisions of how they look at that. There's several ways to comply with the Edgar rule and one of them looks at non-price terms and conditions. So we would be looking at a hearing dealing with our PPA, and I think there are a lot of things that could be said around the non-term price and conditions that would allow the pricing to stand as well.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Two questions. The first one is regarding the Competitive business guidance for 2016. And I guess it was the same as it was in the third quarter look, despite the fact that wholesale power prices are down. Could you talk about what the drivers there were?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Sure, Gregg. This is Donnie. If you take a look at our slide 104 of the fact book you can see the EBITDA guidance. And as you clearly indicated, the fall-off in prices, we reflected that in our open position. We're down about $3 there. But we've also lowered our costs, especially our fossil fuel. We went back and took another hard look at some of the things we'd done in CFIP. We were able to lower that. Net of those two things, the lower revenue from the decline in the open position, net of what we've been able to do on the cost side, our commodity margin's only down about $15 million, which is well in the range of our EBITDA.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then regarding the equity needs, can you talk about your thoughts there in light of some of the write-offs and funding needs that you have?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I've said pretty consistently that we have set a goal of strengthening our balance sheet and getting to where we need to get with the rating agencies without having to use any equity to do that. And I just don't believe that that is the intent of shareholder equity. We've worked very hard this past year. I talked about the results of CFIP. We've also made improvements in other parts of our operation, and then we've got the entire Ohio ESP to get a resolution on before I think we're in any position to talk about what future equity needs might be. We talked about $245 million of incremental investment in Pennsylvania distribution. Under the Ohio ESP there's an extension of the DCR rider plus potential opportunities to invest in increasing the smart distribution network in Ohio.","Along with transmission with ATSI, transmission with MAIT, what we need to do and what we plan to do is communicate to you what type of regulated growth rate we're going to strive for going forward, once we have these last remaining questions done. And then any equity needs are going to be driven off of that. They are not going to be driven off of a need for equity to deal with any of the financial issues that we've been trying to wrestle to the ground this last year. They will only be used for growth, and that's our intent.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What's your current thinking around when the Ohio Commission will rule, and kind of what's your outlook for potential that \u2013 that schedule getting delayed? And if it were delayed beyond the PJM auction, how would it impact your bidding behavior?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as I said in my comments, we're expecting an answer from the Ohio Commission in March. And so I don't think it's going to affect our bidding behavior one way or another. Our Competitive generating business bids in our Competitive fleet. We have regulated generation in West Virginia already that is bid by a regulated generation group. The two do not talk, as required by FERC's Standards of Conduct. This generation will get bid in by one of those two groups, depending on which side of the fence it's on.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you remind us what the original investment in Signal Peak was?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","We made an original cash contribution, about $150 million.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And you sold a piece for what, you said $230 million?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. That's \u2013 we sold 50% of our interest and we had a cash proceeds of about $234 million.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. I'm good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Dan.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","First question just on \u2013 a couple of cash flow questions for you guys, first off. How should we think about bonus depreciation affecting kind of the cash flows coming back in? And how does that get treated at the different utilities\/transmission assets as far as adjusting rate base?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Dan, this is Jim. Bonus depreciation, we were already in a large NOL position through the 2018 and 2019 period, so this is just going to extend that beyond 2021. Obviously these years will change somewhat with the approval of the PPA scenario. On the earnings side, it's really a modest impact from a rate base reduction. We'll see a little bit on the transmission side and certain of our other jurisdictions that have formula like rate recovery such as the DCR in Ohio. But I would say the impact to our earnings rate base is going to be minimal.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So should we assume \u2013 what kind of cash tax rate are you guys assuming through 2021? Are you at an AMT or sub-AMT level then?","K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller","Hey, Dan. This is Jon Taylor. We're at the AMT level.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then I guess on the pension side, did I read it correctly from the last quarter slides, this quarter slides, that your pension expenses are up about $55 million in 2016 versus 2015 on a pre-tax basis?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dan. Two things that are driving that; first is we had a 25 basis point decrease in the return on assets. So we took that down from 7.75% to 7.5%. And then we also saw a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, which would increase our interest costs. So the two of those was about $50 million.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And I guess if we look at the kind of, from the K, the five-year funding plans or obligations for pension are up about $600 million through the five-year running period from last K to this K. Do you guys see any funding obligations around that? Or is it \u2013 because this is kind of beyond 2016 we'll wait and see what happens in the interest rate environment between here and there?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dan, what we have out there, and you're right, our five-year required contributions are about $500 million higher than what the five-year required contributions were in the 2014 10-K. Our actuary Aon, they recalibrate that annually. And at this point these are fundings that we would be required to make. As we said, we have a $381 million contribution required in 2016. We've already made $160 million in January. 2017, we have a $439 million pension contribution. That's down somewhat from where we were in the 2014 10-K where we had $555 million, but again that's associated with our actuary recalibrating when our payments are required and some of those payments were moved out to a future year.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And I guess just last one on the ESP side in Ohio. Does it become a friction point where you have to have a decision in order to implement rates before ESP3 goes away? And how much time or how much cushion do you guys need between PUCO making a decision and you guys being ready to implement?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","So, yes. So it does become that point, but I think it's going to be a moot question because I fully expect the Commission to act in March.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So a decision in March gives you plenty of time.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Correct.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Yeah.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We can here you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So let me just follow up on what Dan was asking there. First, on the bonus depreciation point, can you elaborate a little bit more on the earnings impact rather than the cash flow? And think about what it does separately to the Transmission and the Distribution side as you think about perhaps the next round of rate case and\/or FERC filing?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","At this point, Julien, I would say that the impact on each of the segments would just be pennies. It would not be material at all.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Could you elaborate why that would be, just be clear, just as you think about? Is that principally because you haven't filed, or you don't necessary have a meaningful distribution case contemplated?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. At this point on the Distribution side, it would only impact the utilities that we have formula-like rates considering the DCR in Ohio. We have rates that are in effect in all of our other jurisdictions will likely be looking to go in for rates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but that will not be \u2013 we won't see changes to our rates probably until the 2017 timeframe at this point, but we'll give you more clarification on that when we have our Analyst Day Meeting.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And just to clarify Analyst Day expectations, if there is indeed an issue at FERC, I suppose a, you would expect to host your Analyst Day would be in terms of providing guidance, should we continue to expect EBITDA guidance kind of status quo as you laid out? If the 206 is successful.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Well, I think here's where we're at. We're going to wait till we get the outcome in Ohio. Once we have that then we're going to give you a little clearer guidelines on what we're expecting in terms of our Analyst Meeting. One way or another we're going to be giving you guidance for 2016 that includes the ESP or doesn't include the ESP based on where we're at, at that point in time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then lastly on the Signal Peak assets, what's the situation in terms of the servicing the debt, just the guarantee there? If you can just elaborate in terms of the assets itself?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Okay, Julien. This is Jim. From servicing the debt, the mine continues to service that debt. The only time that we would have a change there is if we become more of a full-time owner of the mine if we would have control of over 50% of that. The first step we would have to do is likely consolidate that debt on to our balance sheet. Right now it's not consolidated because we're only a 33% owner. And then ultimately if there was a capital call that the other owners were not able to fulfill that would also likely require us to make that capital call. At the end, of that $300 million, $100 million is purely ours because we own a 33% interest in that and once we understand fully what happens to the mine, if it would happen to shut down then we would be responsible to fill that obligation to the banks.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","The balance of the obligation.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on, a quick question here. In terms of the PPA associated generation, how much of that if you could remind me, cleared in the 2018\/2019 auction?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","This is Donny, Paul. So Sammis and Beaver Valley it all cleared in the 2018\/2019 auction. I'm sorry, Sammis and Davis-Besse, it all cleared in the 2018\/2019 auction.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then you guys brought up sort of an interesting issue here in terms of how your generation in the PPA would be similar to regulated generation, et cetera. And I don't recall when the Harrison Plant acquisition by the regulated affiliate in Virginia was \u2013 or West Virginia, excuse me, was being purchased, this much of an issue in terms of opposition, et cetera, from generators, et cetera. Why do you think in this case it's being so much more of an issue than it would be in the Harrison case when it sounds to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, the economics would kind of be similar in terms of the impact on the market?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I am at a complete loss for why it is such a big issue for others, because I do think it is financially the same as what happened with Harrison. These units will no longer supply retail load. They will no longer supply polar load. They are not going to influence the competitive market in any way. So I'm at a complete loss for why it has generated such adamant opposition other than potentially misery loves company.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","And if I could add on just a little bit to that. So if you think about the parade of horribles that EPSA and others highlighted in their complaint to FERC, they talked about if you let these generating units look regulated, have in effect what they called an out of market subsidy, that would crash the marketplace. Well, if you think about PJM, as Chuck alluded to earlier, 20% of PJM is already regulated. And that doesn't even include the FRR entities. And if you think about what they were talking about, the bidding aspect of this, it's public information that prior to capacity performance three-quarters, so 75% of the megawatts in the PJM capacity auctions bid at zero. So they bid at price takers. And after CP it was about roughly half.","But if you think about it with the new penalty, that what you associated with that penalty should kind of be your new zero. So I would suggest that the new price takers is actually even higher than 50%. So what that would suggest is some of the generators who actually filed this and complained so loudly saying that it was going to crash the market, they themselves actually bid into the capacity market at zero.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the...","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Paul, and just to be clear on the capacity, I said it all cleared. In actuality when you look at our fact book on slide 119, you'd see that there were 525-megawatts in ATSI that did not clear. And...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm sorry. Go ahead.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","A slice of that may be at Sammis and Davis-Besse, but essentially it all cleared.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","What do you \u2013 why would a slice of it not (44:20), I guess?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, to the degree we bid all of our units on a curve, there could be a slice that didn't clear.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That would be Sammis and Davis-Besse?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, generally we bid all of our units on a curve, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean I guess what I'm wondering, though, is that of the PPA-affiliated plants, some of it may have cleared and some of it may not have cleared. Is that correct?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It would not look any different than the rest of our unregulated plants, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just to get back to Julien's question on the \u2013 just to make sure I understand on the Global Holding guarantee, the $300 million. It wasn't clear to me exactly how much on the hook you guys are if the Signal Peak mine becomes uneconomic or unable to \u2013 and you don't get the capital calls from third parties. How much would be the total risk that you guys may or may not have? I'm just \u2013 it wasn't clear completely.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","The total amount would be $300 million, less any types of proceeds that we could get from the sale of the mine. So if we cannot sell the mine for anything, the maximum would be $300 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Assuming that there is some value to the mine, we would be able to use those proceeds to reduce that amount of exposure.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just two quick questions I guess on the PPA is first, do you think FERC rules before the May PJM auction? And second, you had mentioned the waiver earlier, that you have a waiver between your utility and competitive generation. Is the waiver unique to a particular PPA or is it I guess for any PPA that goes between your utility and competitive businesses?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","This is Leila. So it covers all the transactions between the utilities and the affiliates. And again, the basis upon which it was granted, the circumstances haven't changed. The Commission still retains the ability to protect customers. And I apologize, I forgot your first question?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just do you think FERC rules before the auction in May?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Oh, whether it will rule, I'm sorry. Yes. Nothing's carved in stone and they don't have to. EPSA asked for expedited treatment, but most people believe that they will act before the auction and probably act on the filed paper as opposed to holding a hearing. That would be my best guess.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just quickly then, has FERC ever reversed policy and revoked a waiver?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","I don't know the entire history, but I could tell you what FERC has done with regard to captive customers and shopping. FERC on several occasions has been asked to kind of look behind the curtain and opine whether a state's particular flavor of retail choice is what they would agree with or not. And FERC has consistently said no, as long as they're not captive customers, as long as they can shop, then we're not going to try and second guess what commissions do.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Hi, guys.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Sorry to go on the PPA question again, but I'm just trying to understand the other side. And I know this is clearly not the preferred path, but if the PPA does get cancelled for whichever partner or how it gets cancelled, I'm just trying to paint a picture first from an equity needs perspective and also from a strategic fit perspective. As in, if you do see the PPA getting cancelled, is there any view on how the equity need requirement changes, especially to support the credit? And secondly, strategically do you see this business as still a fit within FE? Or do you look to do an exit in some form at some point?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first off we have not communicated any earnings guidance for full year 2016, whether the PPA gets done or not, and I'm not going to do that here this morning. What I've said is we will deal with that outcome when we have it, and we will communicate at that time what our earnings guidance for 2016 is, what our future growth plans for the utilities are, what our future equity needs might be, if anything, to support that growth. So I think you're just going to have to be patient and wait for the outcome, and then we'll tell you where we're at at that point in time. And beyond that I've consistently said I think that Generation, Transmission and Distribution are all critical assets in terms of serving customers. And right now I don't see any strategic change there for us.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. And on the second question, if I look at the generation of the Competitive business and I look at the...","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would remind you that in my remarks I told you that this business is generating positive EBITDA, positive cash flow through 2018 without any benefit from the Energy Security Plan.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Gotcha. And that's a great lead-in actually to my second question which is, as I think about that positive free cash flow, I guess an important part of that is just the different channels that you sell your generation through. And LCI looks like an important piece of that puzzle. The range that you generally provide for LCI is in the zero to 20-terawatt hours of sales in that LCI direct. 2017 looks like it's just at 5 terawatt hours right now. And clearly it's early days and you're waiting for the PPA. But is there \u2013 the reason why I'm focused on it is, the LCI price versus the spot price, there's like almost a $20 per megawatt hour difference. So I'm just trying to put a lower bound on that LCI sale, as in, at a minimum what level do you see achieving at LCI or LCI channel sales in the 2016\/2017 timeframe?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","So this is Donny. I think actually if you look at slide 104 in the fact book it shows LCI, MCI and mass market we've got 16.4 terawatt hours closed already for 2016 delivery.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No, I'm looking at 2017 and LCI for 2017 is 5 terawatt hours which is what I'm looking at.","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Oh, yeah sure. Yeah. We've got a ways to go there. LCI customers generally are shorter terms contracts compared to government aggregation for example. So it would not be unusual to be able to close 10 terawatt hours or 15 terawatt hours in a year prior to the delivery year.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And do you expect those prices to be at similar levels to where you currently cleared which is around $54 per megawatt hour, $55 per megawatt hour?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","That's more difficult to say, because what you got to keep in mind embedded in that price is the price of capacity. So a customer in ATSI in the 2015\/2016 timeframe is going to look different than a RTO customer and that's going to look different than a customer in the 2017\/2018 timeframe. So it's very hard for us to say kind of what price we would end up locking those in at. What I would tell you is we would have consistent margins.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","Good morning. This will be quick I think. In comparing the fact sheets, it looks like the transmission spend you're projecting a little up for 2016, lower in 2017. But nothing has changed with respect to Energizing the Future. I mean the overall project is pretty much on track from the way you initially set it up a couple of years ago, correct?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research","That's the only question I had. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, well there are no more questions in the queue. I'd just like to thank you all for your continued support. I look forward to getting our answer from Ohio here in a few weeks and then look forward to meeting you all face to face at the Analyst Meeting following that.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on the website. Please note that we have also provided a slide presentation that will follow this morning's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; Brian Farley, Vice President of Sales for the Competitive business; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share, while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures as well as strong operational results across all three of our business segments.","For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share, which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results.","In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives, including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our four utilities.","The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017, and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27.","Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including Rate Counsel and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state.","And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a distribution modernization rider that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year, including the gross up for taxes, through 2019, with a possible two-year extension.","Moving to our Transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that had been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes.","I'm going to devote the rest of my time to discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our Competitive Generation business. As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe Competitive Generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy. But one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible.","We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-light construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to customers, both now and in the future. And, of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently.","We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our Generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence.","But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is Competitive Generation is weighing down the rest of our company. And while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our Competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from Competitive markets.","We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term, with a goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert Competitive Generation to a regulated or regulated-light construct in Ohio, while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources.","And in West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny Energy Supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated.","We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units, similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis Units 1 through 4 and Bay Shore. Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives.","We believe an accelerated timeframe is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully-regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our Competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year, in both 2017 and 2018, and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation.","We met last week with all three of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility, and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales.","However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions, or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018 could cause FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions, including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection.","We have received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the Competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees. So the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our Competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation.","Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation-related matters and that business' portion of deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our Competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review.","Also note that as we make this transition we are planning to move forward with the bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.","As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share, and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015, with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales.","In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increase in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale, coal mining and steel industries, as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last year and a half, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales, but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase, primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year.","Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather-normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 0.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the eastern part of our territory.","Turning to our Transmission business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and TrAIL, which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our Regulated Distribution segment to our Regulated Transmission segment related to a small portion of Transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L.","These assets were always under a Transmission rate, but were included as part of our Distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the two segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance, and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today.","In our Competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecasts. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume, which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues, reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. The commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, fuel and purchased power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position.","As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt hours remaining open to market prices. Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by a higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses.","As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details, a five-year capital expenditure forecast for Transmission, a three-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate, 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the Competitive businesses, long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI Conference.","Now I'd like to open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So when you talk about being on an accelerated timeframe to come to decisions with regard to the different outcomes for FES, I know you on purpose didn't give a specific timeframe because you're not sure. But do you think that you'll have wrapped up all your regulatory paths and asset sale paths at some point in 2017 and that this will be resolved during that fiscal year? Or do you think it's possible that it could take more than the next five quarters to resolve all of these decisions?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So here's what I'd say, Greg. I think we really started this transformation to a regulated company at EEI in 2013. And that launched a significant regulatory agenda that included rate proceedings in West Virginia, Ohio, twice in Pennsylvania, twice in New Jersey. Those are now all behind us. It included decisions along the way to retire assets that were uneconomic. And now we have some decisions that we have to get done in the near term.","What I've said in my remarks and what I would say as an answer to your question is we expect to complete this entire process in 12 to 18 months. And in that time period, you'll be looking at a fully regulated company. There are steps along the way that I can't give you timing on the specific steps, but we're not going to let those get in the way of that goal of being fully regulated within the next 12 to 18 months.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. Follow-up question to that. As we think about, it's obviously not going to be clear exactly where your balance sheet is going to end up in that we don't understand how many of the assets will be sold and how the cash flows at the parent are going to look, but should we presume that in your discussions with the rating agencies that they're going to articulate a goal for you in terms of where your FFO-to-debt at the parent needs to be after this transition and you'll be given a period of time to right-size your balance sheet, should you need to, to get to those metrics?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, that is their job and they've never been hesitant to do their job. So I fully expect \u2013 we met with them, as I said during the call, last week. I fully expect that later today they're going to begin talking about what their expectations are. And I'm confident that we will be able to deliver on those expectations, particularly at the holding company level. And then we have to see where this strategic decision takes us with the Competitive business over the next 12 to 18 months.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","You may not be able to answer this, but I need to ask it. When it comes to the holding company-level credit, do you think that you'll be given a period of time over which to evolve to the metrics they're going to hold you to? Or do you think that that would require a significant equity issuance in the near term?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I'd say we're going to wait and see what they say. But I can tell you this, we have positioned those metrics at the holding company pretty much where they need to be anyway over the next three years irrespective of the decisions that we're talking about today.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to \u2013 one specific thing, you mentioned the possibility of up to a bankruptcy filing of the Competitive business. Can you give us any feeling for how much \u2013 and you gave the disclosure on pension and guarantees. Is there any sense of how much operating expense that's currently allocated to Competitive might flow back to the parent in such a scenario?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Not at this time, Jonathan. We have an extensive review going on of what our company will look like when this transition is done. And as we study that and understand it better, we'll be able to talk to you about it at that time.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So that's not something that'll be apparent in disclosures later today.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I think that was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association (sic) [Associates] (24:10). Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey. Just as of follow-up on Jonathan's question, how should we think about tax synergies in the event that FES were to be in Chapter 11 or what have you? And just how do we think about the company in the absence of this currently problematic Generation business? How do we think about things like tax synergies and what have you?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I would give you the same answer there that I just gave on some of the expenses that are shared throughout the company. We have to get into this process and understand it fully. There are going to be a whole lot of different views on how that might get handled in the event that we get to that point. But as I've said, we've got other things that we plan to execute on in the short term here before we ever get to the point where that question even has to be answered.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then in terms of, you mentioned after the election having certain meetings and what have you. Is there any point in time where there's a fish or cut bait sort of thing where a decision has to be made?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would say this. We're committed to executing this transition to a fully regulated company within the next 12 to 18 months. That would suggest that if there's going to be any policy decisions made by these states, they're going to have to be made early in 2017 for them to be able to be impactful on that schedule.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to talk about the rail contracts. Has anything changed on that front? I think you guys thought that there might have been environmental force majeure. So what has changed since then? It seems like you talk a little more negatively on it now.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't think I was talking negatively at all. I was just disclosing the fact that it's out there and a very negative impact could cause us to look at what we do with the Competitive business more quickly when it relates to a financial restructuring. But I don't feel negative about it at all.","If you want, Leila can give you a little update on the timeline as to when we expect all this to happen.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","So we disclosed in our Q the liability phase of the proceeding is scheduled to commence in late November. The damages phase, if necessary, would begin in May. And then again, with the liability phase, we would expect a decision within 60 days of the end of that, which we've identified to be February 24 of 2017.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then another point that you that pointed out to was the 2018 debt maturities. Those are at the muni side, which you have a very concentrated investor base. Have you talked to any of the investors to potentially renegotiate, restructure, or even smooth out the maturity schedule?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Not at this time.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. So quickly on the new board members at the Generation side. I wanted to understand, is the thinking behind that to create more separation between Generation and the holding company with the goal that \u2013 and I guess, does it suggest that there is a risk that claims from the Generation can flow up back to the parent?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Here's what I'd say. As we started to think about what we have to accomplish over the next 12 to 18 months, it became apparent that more governance was good and more external governance is good. So we are moving forward with adding outside independent directors to the FirstEnergy Solutions board strictly for that purpose, so that we have more external governance into the process.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Gotcha. And secondly, in terms of equity issuance, you've talked about $500 million for 2016. Is there any other sense of timing in terms of if there is more needed? Is there a certain timeline we should be thinking about for additional equity?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","We have announced that we will issue $500 million of equity into our pension plan yet in 2016, and we continue to plan to do that and expect to get that done. Any further equity discussion, I'm going to put you off for now, and we'll talk to you about it at EEI.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Gotcha. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a lot of effort and hard work and success on the regulated side. A question, just rate case, I see the settlement in New Jersey. Congrats on that. Just curious, both from New Jersey and Pennsylvania, can you bridge us from the rate increases down to what may be the after-tax income impact would be? Just trying to think about things like in New Jersey, are there some higher costs that will go into service next year that might offset some of the rate case? And in Pennsylvania, are there any other things like tax or other items that could impact the after-tax contribution?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Michael. This is Jim. I would say from New Jersey, I would look at that $80 million, the pre-tax number, as flowing through the bottom line. As well, in Pennsylvania, I would expect of that $291 million, about $203 million pre-tax will fall through to the bottom line.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So there's no other incremental cost items that might offset that?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's correct.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. One other thing. Just in thinking about Transmission opportunities over the coming months or coming years, when you look at MAIT, do you see significant Transmission opportunities like you saw with ATSI and TrAIL five to seven years ago?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, absolutely. That's why we began the process to form MAIT in the first place. And I think, Michael, the amount of work that we could execute on, I think we've identified almost $20 billion worth of work that we could put in that queue. It's just a matter of we haven't communicated the speed at which we plan to execute that work plan yet. And again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about that coming up at EEI.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just sort of on Michael's question, for the pre-tax impacts and the rate increase in Pennsylvania, can I just use like a normal 38% tax rate to determine net income impact?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, you can use that, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to just understand the tax implications relating to your Competitive business. Would you mind just laying out what your tax basis is? And also, I guess, really importantly, in the event of either a sale or a reorganization of the business, do you believe you can effectively use that tax loss back up to the parent perhaps to effectively allow for greater growth in the sense that you would not be a taxpayer presumably for quite some period of time?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Stephen. This is Jim. To your first question, our tax basis is about $4.3 billion there. And in fact, to Chuck's earlier comment, I think there has to be a lot more analysis done on that before we determine if we're able to utilize any of those tax benefits back at the parent if we got to that point in time. So I think it's just too premature right now.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Julien.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So I just wanted to follow up and make sure I heard you right. So you said your metrics would be able to get you there for the next few years, kind of status quo. Was that basically referring to solving for a 14% FFO-to-debt metric for the next few years?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we're there in 2017 and we're very close in 2018 and 2019. And I think we could close that gap without too much difficulty. So, yeah, I think \u2013 but here's why I'd say, Julien. The rating agencies are going to do their job and they're going to issue their reports later today or probably at the latest, Monday. So we're waiting to see what they're going to say, too.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. But you're saying without too much of a gap, you're suggesting further cost cuts, not equity, to resolve that difference?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think it's pretty clear that our Competitive business is stressed. But it's also pretty clear to me that we've taken the necessary steps to stabilize our FFO-to-debt at the holding company level.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then turning back to Pennsylvania. Sorry to hammer on this one. In terms of \u2013 what's the implied earned ROE as you think about the next few years? Just trying to reconcile the rate-based math relative to the settlement.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Julien, this is Jim. That was kind of like a black box settlement, so I don't want to get into what any implied rate of return is at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Fair enough. Ultimately on a trailing basis, would you say you've continued to earn your ROE, though?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would say once all of the rates are in place, then we will be earning a representative ROE at all of the jurisdictions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But even on a trailing basis prior to the rates going into effect in Pennsylvania?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we have a forward-looking test here in Pennsylvania, so I would say, on a trailing basis, we were earning it. And what this rate case included was our forward-looking costs as well as our customer consumption during that period of time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Excellent. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Pearson for closing comments.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay. Well, there are no more questions here. I'm sure you're holding them for us starting Sunday at EEI. So look forward to \u2013 we're going to be putting out some additional disclosures later today, and I look forward to seeing you all there. And hopefully by the time we come out of EEI, we plan to try to combine the Analyst Day that we've talked about for the last year and a half with EEI and share a lot of information about what we believe this fully regulated company is going to look like. So look forward to seeing you there. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a presentation which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid 2017 results along with 2018 earnings guidance and a growth rate that provides investors with visibility into our regulated opportunities through 2021. Our operating earnings results surpassed our original guidance for the year and are near the upper end of the revised range we provided last quarter. We have now achieved three straight years of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the operating earnings guidance we provided to investors. I am proud of the financial discipline our entire team has shown over this three-year period.","Our 2017 operating earnings reflect the strong financial performance in our distribution and transmission businesses as well as the positive impact of our regulated growth strategy. Our GAAP earnings were impacted by impairments and plant exit costs at our competitive business as well as charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Jim will discuss these in more detail shortly.","We are gratified that our plans to transform our company into a highly performing, fully regulated utility earned the confidence of several prominent investors who made a $2.5 billion equity investment in our company last month to support this transition. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the positive impacts this transaction is having on our company.","First, it allowed us to strengthen FirstEnergy's balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. We used some of the proceeds to make a $750 million contribution to our employee pension plan, coupled with a $500 million contribution we made earlier in 2018. We don't expect any further required contributions to the pension through 2020. We also reduced holding company debt by $1.45 billion and, as a result, we are positioned for a sustained investment grade credit metrics through at least 2021. This transaction also eliminates the need to issue any additional equity outside of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans during our current planning period which runs through 2021.","Second, the transaction facilitates an accelerated growth in infrastructure investment improvement program for our transmission and distribution businesses. For 2018, we are introducing regulated operating earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per diluted share. This represents operating earnings from our distribution and transmission businesses, net of the corporate segment.","With those regulated operating earnings as our base, we're also introducing a long-term regulated operating earnings growth rate projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. This excludes the DMR in Ohio and is offset by the corporate segment. This growth rate reflects incremental investments in both the distribution utilities and transmission companies which I will discuss later for a total capital investment of more than $10 billion over that timeframe.","I will note that these projections are presented on a fully diluted basis reflecting the full impact of the preferred shares in 2018. Beginning with first quarter 2018 results, we intend to report on a fully diluted basis to provide you with a comparative view of the company's performance. Finally, our January transaction includes the formation of a Restructuring Working Group or RWG that will advise our FirstEnergy management team as it addresses any potential restructuring at FES.","The restructuring working group includes three FirstEnergy executives: Jim Pearson, Leila Vespoli, and Gary Benz, our Senior Vice President of Strategy; along with outside industry professionals, John Wilder of Bluescape and Tony Horton of Energy Future Holdings. The group has already started work, and they received a presentation from FES management to help the outside members become familiar with the business.","FES continues to meet with its creditor advisors, and we anticipate that the RWG will be involved in those discussions at some point as well. It's important to emphasize that RWG is serving FirstEnergy's management and that FirstEnergy Solutions board of directors will continue to make decisions about FES, including any restructuring decisions. Together, these actions are designed to transform FirstEnergy by allowing us to fully shift our focus towards the tremendous opportunities in our regulated growth strategy.","So let's review the very strong full-year operating performance at our regulated businesses and other developments across our company. In our transmission business, we saw higher 2017 earnings as we completed the initial phase of our Energizing the Future investment program. During the first four years of the program, we invested more than $4 billion to support system reliability and enhanced service to our customers.","For the second phase of the program, we're increasing the low end of our targeted annual investments by $200 million. This will bring our planned investments to $1 billion to $1.2 billion annually through 2021. During the second phase, we will continue expanding the program into the Eastern part of our service territory.","In December, JCP&L filed a settlement agreement with FERC that provides for rates effective January 1, pending a final FERC order, and also provides JCP&L the opportunity to file for forward-looking rates to be effective in 2020. We expect FERC to rule on that settlement as well as the MAIT settlement that we filed in October in the next several months.","In our distribution business, 2017 was a great year. Our results reflect the new rates that went into effect in several of our service territories last January, which more than offset the $0.19 per share impact of milder weather compared to 2016. We're also pleased with the load trends that emerged throughout the year. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial deliveries were consistent with our forecast while residential load exceeded our original expectations. In addition, we have now achieved six consecutive quarters of growth in industrial deliveries, primarily driven by the shale gas, steel and petroleum industries.","Together, 2017 operating earnings from our Regulated Distribution and Transmission businesses, offset by the corporate segment, reflect an increase of more than 25% over 2016 or 14% when you exclude the DMR. As we look at 2018 and beyond, our Ohio utilities filed an application with the PUCO in December for a $450 million three-year plans to redesign and modernize portions of their distribution system to reduce the frequency and duration of power outages as well as prepare the system for smart grid technologies. The Distribution Platform Modernization plan will help our Ohio utilities to restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions.","In New Jersey, the BPU approved rulemaking for the Infrastructure Investment Program in December. This creates a mechanism that allows utilities to accelerate certain investments that enhance reliability, resiliency, and safety. We expect JCP&L to make a filing later this year. Incremental growth initiatives represented by our increased transmission investment and filings in Ohio and New Jersey, as well as a modest distribution rate case in Maryland are the primary drivers of the increase in our projected regulated operating earnings growth rate to 6% to 8%.","Finally, before I move away from the utility discussion, I will note that Mon Power and Potomac Edison are evaluating alternatives to address their projected capacity shortfall in West Virginia. Given the outcome of our application to transfer ownership of Allegheny Energy's Pleasants Power Station to Mon Power, our purchase agreements was terminated in light of FERC's decision and the West Virginia Public Service Commission's conditions, which would have resulted in significant exposure to commodity risk at our utility. As a result, on Friday, Allegheny Energy notified PJM that the Pleasants Power Station will deactivate on January 1, 2019. We will continue to pursue opportunities to sell the plant while we prepare for deactivation.","Moving to other Allegheny Energy news, you'll recall that in December, we completed the sale of 859 megawatts of generating capacity at the Springdale, Chambersburg, Gans, and Hunlock plants for approximately $388 million in net proceeds. The transactions involving the Buchanan and Bath plants are each on track and expected to close in the first half of this year. After paying off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole premium payments, the net proceeds to Allegheny Energy Supply from the sale of all six of these facilities are expected to be about $220 million.","Let's turn now to FirstEnergy Solutions. It is common knowledge that we were very actively involved in a multitude of efforts at both the state and federal levels to support our generation assets in a way that would have benefited our communities, employees and FES creditors. I'm personally disappointed that the endeavors haven't resulted in a meaningful legislative or regulatory support given the importance of these plants to grid resiliency, reliable and affordable power and the region's economy. FES will continue to look at all options regarding these units, and we will continue to support policy solutions. However, as Jim will discuss, we have fully impaired our nuclear assets because the inability to receive any form of legislative or regulatory support has increased the likelihood that the plants will not be able to operate until the end of their useful lives.","At the end of January, FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC were $46 million invested in the unregulated money pool. We expect that they will exit the money pool sometime between now and the end of March and draw down the $500 million secured credit facility from FirstEnergy. The current forecast shows FES to have money pool borrowings of up to $100 million between now and March 31.","As we prepare for our future as a fully regulated utility, we are continuing our efforts to ensure that our organization is well positioned to grow and prosper and that our cost structure is properly aligned, particularly at our shared services organization. Last year, we told you that we launched an initiative called FE Tomorrow to create this blueprint for our future. The FE Tomorrow team worked with Accenture to develop a variety of scenarios to achieve this goal. Now, as we move closer to our vision of becoming fully regulated, we're entering the next stage of that effort. A team of employees reporting to Jim Pearson has been charged to implementing the FE Tomorrow strategies over the next 12 to 24 months.","As we announced yesterday, Jim has been named Executive Vice President, Finance. While he will continue to oversee the financial organization, this new role will ensure he can give his utmost attention to FirstEnergy Tomorrow and the RWG. Steve Strah, our Senior Vice President of FirstEnergy Utilities, will be stepping into the CFO position, reporting to Jim. And Sam Belcher, our Senior Vice President of FENOC and Chief Nuclear Officer, will take over Steve's role as Senior Vice President of Utilities. These changes and several others announced yesterday strengthen our succession planning by moving key individuals into new roles that will broaden their knowledge of our business. We believe this will help ensure that FirstEnergy is positioned to continue meeting our commitments to investors and customers well into the future.","2017 was a great year for our regulated businesses. We're very excited about the transformation that is taking place at FirstEnergy and for the opportunity to accelerate our regulated growth and infrastructure improvement plans that will benefit our 6 million customers, as well as our shareholders.","Now, Jim, will provide a review of the fourth quarter results.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, everyone. As always, we have provided detailed information about the quarter in our consolidated report to the financial community which is posted on our website. Yesterday, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $5.62 per share that reflects asset impairment and plant exit cost at our competitive generation fleet and charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will take a few minutes to discuss these items before I move on to fourth quarter drivers.","We recorded asset impairment and plant exit cost of $2.4 billion or $3.38 per share in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of reducing the carrying value of the Pleasants Power Station, fully impairing our nuclear-generating assets and increasing our nuclear asset retirement obligations, given the outlook for the fleet. In addition, our fourth quarter GAAP results, include a non-cash charge of $1.2 billion or $2.68 per share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which primarily impacted our competitive business given its significant deferred tax asset position.","We are working with all of our state regulatory commissions to determine the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on utility customer rates which would flow through to our FFO given that we aren't a federal cash tax payer.","Shifting gears to the results from our operations during the fourth quarter, we had a very strong operating earnings of $0.71 per share. Driving those results was a $0.23 per share improvement in our distribution business compared to the same period in 2016. This primarily reflected the new rates that went into effect in January 2017 as well as higher weather-related usage.","Heating degree days were normal for the quarter but 9% higher than the same period of 2016. This drove a nearly 2% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the residential sector, sales were up 4%, while commercial deliveries were down 3%. On a weather-adjusted basis, fourth quarter residential deliveries were essentially flat, while commercial deliveries decreased 4% as a result of lower sales and energy efficiency efforts compared to the same period of 2016. Looking at industrial sales, the positive trends continued in the fourth quarter with growth of more than 3% compared to last year, driven by gas drilling and the recovery in steel.","In the transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of higher revenues related to our Energizing the Future program. Fourth quarter operating earnings in the competitive business improved due to favorable depreciation and general taxes, partially offset by lower commodity margin and higher O&M expenses. As always, we will remain focused on meeting our commitments to our shareholders and executing our regulated growth plans.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Jim. Now, we will move into the question-and-answer phase of our call. I want to preface the Q&A that we will not be able to provide detailed information about the status of negotiations with FES credit advisers or creditors. FES has been operating independently since early 2017, and neither I or the other executives on this call can speak on behalf of FES.","Now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Congratulations.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, first off, can you talk a little bit about the CapEx that you're reflecting here? How much of the latest JCP&L and Ohio efforts are reflected in that range that you guys just released here?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Julien, this is Jim. At the upper end of our guidance, we've included the $450 million filing that we made in Ohio, as well as we anticipate that we'll make a filing later this year in New Jersey for the Infrastructure Improvement Plan. So, I'd say at the top end of the range, it includes the $450 million in Ohio, and it also includes some money for the Infrastructure Improvement Plan in New Jersey.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then turning back to the earned ROEs, can you talk about what's kind of embedded as you think on the outer years of that regulated guidance? And specifically, can you talk a little bit more to Pennsylvania and what your thoughts are there? I know that there are some deferred tax items in the regulatory filings there and that's created a little bit of obfuscation out there and truly understanding what the earned returns are.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Julien, in Pennsylvania, the ROEs have not been defined since there was a settlement in those cases. When I think about Pennsylvania and I've heard a little bit of the questions that you just raised but we've just had two cases that have been fully tried in Pennsylvania. They've been before the staff of the Commission as well as the Commission itself. And I'd also note that when I look at our residential rates in Pennsylvania and compare them to our peers, we're about 13% below what our peers are in that state. So I don't see where there's any concern about where we're at in Pennsylvania.","And you are right on the deferred taxes. There's a number of adjustments associated with deferred taxes in a rate-making process versus what you look at just from a pure GAAP standpoint.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So I'll just follow on with that based on everything Jim said. There should be absolutely no concern in the market about us over-earning in Pennsylvania. And if there is any hysteria out there, you all are smart enough to know that there are people that trade off with the hysteria. But I just want to emphasize there should be no concern whatsoever.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. And then overall, across the utilities, what are you reflecting out in the 2020\/2021 timeframe?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","As far as what, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Earned returns, just in the longer dated regulated numbers you just released.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think you would see that we're assuming that our earned returns on all the utilities would approximate what we had in our filings out there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Fair enough.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","And again (00:23:22) but we're right in line with those.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted touch on tax reform and just when we think about the rate base numbers that you've laid out, how much of an impact upward in terms of an increase in your rate base could be attributed to tax reform? Has that been a material impact at all in terms of your overall sort of projected rate base or has that not really been a driver in the numbers that you've laid out here?","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Stephen. It's Jon. I think we actually have a slide on that. But if you remember, the only thing that's really going to impact us is the elimination of bonus depreciation which was scaling down anyway under the original tax code. So that was 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019. That would be about a $400 million uplift to rate base with the elimination of those two years.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And so that's the extent of it. I'm sorry.","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Both on the Regulated Distribution and Transmission businesses.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. And just on FES, I respect that we really can't get into discussion on the negotiations. I just wanted to understand from FirstEnergy's perspective, you know there's an upcoming bond payment due. Occasionally, there's concern raised about whether or not FirstEnergy might extend the period of effective ownership of FES or \u2013 I'm really effectively trying to just check with you all on your firmness for the timeline of exiting that business and just get your latest thinking on that.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I said in my prepared remarks that I expect that they will be removed from the unregulated money pool between now and the end of March, and that will be the last tie that we have with that business. While I can't speak for FES, I will be shocked if they go beyond as far out some type of a filing.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, Chuck. And just, I guess, related to that, when we think about the management of the business after that, a key upcoming item is the May capacity auction in PJM. Who would be sort of responsible at that point for the bidding strategy in dealing with some of these assets that appear to be fairly economically challenged? How would that sort of, in practice, play out?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","It's FES' decision whether and how to bid in that upcoming auction for the FES assets. It would be Allegheny Energy Supply's decision the same for the Pleasants Power Station, and it would be Mon Power's decision for the assets that are of Mon Power's.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","When we're looking to model out and sort of corroborate our comfort level with the earnings trajectory that you've laid out, I think what you're implying in the way that you've laid out your guidance is that we should assume that, at a minimum, you're getting incremental revenue requirement every year on the capital you're deploying through the rider mechanisms in the different states. But anything that's under a stated rate, the only sort of revenue increases outside of formal rate case would come from any organic revenue growth that you're able to generate. Is that fair?","And then, how do we think about O&M? I think you're saying that we should assume that overall you'll keep control of O&M flat. Just trying to come up with a set of basic modeling parameters that we can use to corroborate your confidence level at, let's say, the midpoint of guidance.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Greg, you're right. And let me really be clear about what our guidance is. We have a midpoint of $2.15, and that is what the 6% to 8% growth rate is based off of, so it's a midpoint of $2.15 with a 6% to 8% growth rate. We do have baked in increases in revenues associated with any capital spend that falls under the riders, primarily our transmission spend as well as in Ohio at the upper end, the DMR that would fall under a rider, as well as we would expect the infrastructure improvement plan in New Jersey would. So stated rates, unless there is a filing, we would not get any increases from those other than on organic growth.","Now we do have a modest rate case built in for Maryland, but that's the only rate case that we have in our guidance right now. From an O&M perspective, yes, you're correct. We're going to hold O&M flat, and you'll see an improvement in O&M associated with our pension expense. And that's primarily the result of our plan generated an additional $500 million in earnings in 2017 compared to what we expected as well as the additional $1.250 billion contribution that we made in January. So I hope that helps, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","It does. It does. And then the share count you've given us is fully diluted, assuming all of the preferreds convert, correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","So in actuality, in what year will that average share count be the actual average share count because in the interim, we're actually being impacted with lower share count but the preferreds...","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","They would have to convert by the middle of 2019. So you're right there. The $536 million is fully diluted and I think we have it probably growing to about $545 million by 2021, and that just assumes the incremental equity issuance associated with our dividend reinvestment plans.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So that's the actual share count more or less in 2020, and then it grows as you continue to use your plans.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's correct. As we continue to issue through our plans, it would increase.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you, sir.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So I'll just follow on a little bit on the O&M. Our utility companies have done an outstanding job of managing O&M over really the last 10 to 15 years. And when you benchmark it, we have very low O&M costs compared to our peers, and that's one of the key drivers behind the fact, as Jim stated, in Pennsylvania, our rates are lower than our peers. And that's true pretty much in every state that we serve.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, most of my questions were answered. But just from a modeling standpoint, there's been some very healthy growth that the slides are showing on your distribution year-over-year into 2018. What's sort of driving this especially since we have an absence of rate cases?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","What period are you looking at, Shar?","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just from 2017 to 2018, looks like distribution is growing a little over 15%.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Let me take a shot at that, Shar. We have some revenue that will grow in 2018 compared to 2017. First, it reflects a full year of the Pennsylvania rate case. As you'll recall, that did not go into effect until the latter part of January, so we'll have a full year. We also have incremental revenues associated with the Ohio DCR. And then we have some growth in West Virginia associated with the industrial load that we've talked about where we expect some growth there.","From a expense side, we expect improvement in our expenses, and that's primarily associated with the pension expense that I talked about earlier. And then we also assume that 2018 will be on a normal weather year. So that that would drive about $0.06 in earnings when you compare it to 2017. So I think those are the primary drivers, and that's offset a little bit by additional depreciation and general taxes.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Jim, and then just normalize it after that. Okay. And then just real quick on sort of tax reform, there's some preliminary evidence from several commissioners around the regions that they may not necessarily need a lot of that cash back immediately in order to obviously mitigate some rate volatility, et cetera.","So when you sort of think about the plan you kind of laid out here, what's the base case scenario you're assuming in this kind of a growth outlook, especially given the fact that you're in multiple states? And then is there an opportunity, especially given the O&M leverage you have, in order to accelerate some of that distribution spending especially in light of your O&M levers and tax savings that you have?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Let me take that. In our base plan, we have not recognized any benefit associated with tax reform. Right now, we're working with all five of the commissions to see what is the most appropriate way to handle this going forward. But when you look at our plan that we have out there, it does not recognize any benefits associated with tax reform.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on that last point. So, in Ohio, you guys are not planning on any benefit associated with the lower tax rate flowing through to earnings, is that correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","We have no benefit in our plan that we laid out, that's correct, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Because there was some filings, I guess, about how \u2013 there was some position that perhaps because it wasn't a general rate case, it was a base rate case that there won't be a true-up until 2024. Is there any \u2013 could you elaborate a little bit on that or what the difference is in that?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we have a stay-out provision through May 31, 2024. So, technically, we will not begin to adjust our rates for any reason, whether expenses go up, whether taxes go up or taxes go down. I can say that we've already addressed the riders. The DMR and DCR filed for lower taxes there. But we have not done anything on the other side with Ohio other than in our plan that we've laid out, we have not incorporated any of those tax benefits.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So in other words, so just to make it crystal clear, the fact that tax rates are going down will not \u2013 they're not going to be benefiting your EPS in terms of the guidance that you provided, is that correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Right now, they will not be benefiting our guidance, right, and we're not flowing anything through. Those would be deferred at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then the FES, I understand that the auction decisions and what have you are going to be done by FES is your expectation. But you guys are obviously going to be very much apprised about what's going on in the wholesale market just from being a big utility operating in it.","What is your expectation or thoughts about \u2013 since you haven't gotten \u2013 since policy has not shown up to be supportive of the power plants? Incrementally, how many power plants, just generally speaking, do you think might be leaving, might not be participating or at least clearing the auction in May? Do you follow what I'm saying?","I mean, I know that you're not necessarily going to be making the decision there, but just in general, when you guys are looking out there and you're looking at supply and demand and what have you, just from a strategic perspective, what are you guys thinking might be the amount of capacity that fails to show up or to clear the auction, if you follow me?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I'm not going to speculate about what others might do with their assets. I'll just give you my simple view of the future. Unless something is done to change the construct of these administrated markets which have been administrated in a way to disadvantaged coal and nuclear plants, over the long haul, unless the states step in to provide support, there will be no coal or nuclear plants left in these markets.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan","Good morning, Chuck and Jim.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan","For the corporate segments, the guidance that you guys provided is a lot lower than we had been modeling. I'm wondering if you moved any corporate costs or other costs from FES or the unregulated segment into there and that is baked into the guidance range that you give. And then also if there's any kind of successful cost cutting baked into that as well as we go out in the plan?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. What we've assumed in the plan is that none of the costs that are currently being charged to FES are included, other than about $25 million associated with depreciation and that's associated with common systems that we have between FES and ourselves, and that would be accounting systems, payroll, accounts payable, something like that.","The other impact on the corporate side is we've lost some of the tax shield where the interest used to be deducted at a 35% rate. Now, it's a 21% rate. So, that's driving some of that difference. But I would expect, in the plan going forward, corporate would hold flat in about the $0.55 range.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan","Okay. So, you're including only $25 million of depreciation moved into corporate in the plan, but you think that given everything you know that's pretty realistic with all of your cost-cutting efforts to date and going forward at the corporate level?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's correct. That's what we have built in there. That's right.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan","Okay. And then my second question is you've mentioned just no incremental equity needs going forward other than the internal plans that were previously part of your guidance. Anyway I just wanted to make sure that you're confident that you can fund the existing or the new CapEx program entirely with internal cash flows and debt.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, we are comfortable we can do that and you'll see we do have some new debt built into the plan. But when you think of a transmission spend that is in the $4 billion to $4.8 billion range, typically about half of that is funded through debt as well as any new capital above what we have in distribution would be new debt. But yeah, we're very confident we can do that internally.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No additional equity through 2021. I can't believe its only one month after doing $2.5 billion that we're already getting that question again. But there will be none.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan","Okay. Fair enough, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill - UBS","Yeah. Thank you. Can you talk to the $450 million Distribution Platform Modernization plan in Ohio just kind of what sort of reception you've gotten since you filed it and what the process is there and any \u2013 how you thought about scaling it and if there's likely to be any change, up or down, to the program?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, up till now, we have just been answering questions from the staff about what it is, what it does, how it helps customers. And beyond that, I don't think we're in a position to really say. I'd ask Leila to add to that but...","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","So the impetus behind that, we had another filing out there for a more full-blown, if you would, grid modernization plan. That kind of got stalled when the Commission was having its different platform and then the discussions around the state. And so we looked at our system, and there are certain things that can be done and should be done that any smart grid system can be built off of. And so that's what we have in front of them.","So it's a way for the Commission to consider it, to not tie their hands. And quite frankly, as you're looking at the spend, to kind of phase it in. So \u2013 and discussions we had pre-filing, it was warmly received. And we'll see \u2013 we don't have a schedule yet in terms of hearings, whether they can meet the date we requested or whether it might have to slip a little bit. But the concept, in any regard, was warmly received when we shared it with the Commission.","Gregg Orrill - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks so much. So my question is on tax reform. And I understand that it's not really built into the forecast right now or the plan you've put out. But from a cash flow perspective, can you just walk through what you expect the cash flow impact to be because obviously revenue is coming down and you have DTL refunds as well. So what do you expect that cash flow impact to be and how is that impacting your FFO to debt?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","When we look at the full impact of tax reform, Praful, if we had to adjust all of the rates, it would probably impact our FFO to debt by about 1 to 1.5 percentage points. And right now, our forecast assumes those cash flows are not there and we still remain at about a 13% FFO through 2021. So, I'm not concerned about that. But when you think about the stated \u2013 or the formula rates, they will reset whenever those dates are. For the others, they'll reset whenever there's another rate proceeding or commissions decide to actually.","As far as refunding customers, I think they'll follow the normalization rules, and ultimately those amounts will be refunded over the life of those assets, which is generally 30 to 40 years. So, any cash flows that flow through now that are not required to be flowed back to the customers immediately, then that's going to benefit our cash flow and it's going to further improve our FFO to debt.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I got you. That's helpful. So, in that refund, can you just break down the DTL portion of it? Is there a protected and unprotected portion and what is the assumption of refund on the unprotected piece?","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Praful, this is Jon. There is an unprotected piece. It's very small in the grand scheme of things. The excess deferred taxes was about $2.3 billion. 95% of that, if not more, was related to property which would be protected and be refunded over the life of those assets.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And then finally, just to add the DMR to it, I'm assuming in your current FFO to debt, you're building in the cash flow coming in from the DMR. If the DMR doesn't get extended, plus you have the FFO impact of the lower revenues and potentially some DTL refunds even though it's small, can you tell us what that FFO to debt looks like excluding DMR and then building in the impact of tax reform?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's right. As I've said earlier, Praful, we have built in the full impact of tax reform in our forecast. It goes through 2021. And also, we did not assume the DMR would be extended beyond 2019 and our FFO is still in the 13% range.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And the target for FFO is that level or is there a different target?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think we're comfortable with the plan we have right now, and the amount of capital investment that we plan to make that the 13% range is appropriate. As time goes on, we would like to drive that up somewhat, but I think we're very comfortable with where that is right now going to a fully regulated model and the amount of capital investment that we're planning to do.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And just finally is the parent debt to...","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Praful, we need to move on. We're running out of time and there are about six, seven more people in the queue to ask questions.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So please limit your questions to one or two, not five or six.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. When you talk about I guess O&M as being a potential driver, I guess, can you quantify sort of the pension benefit that you're assuming numerically? And also, is there any further reduction in O&M beyond sort of the pension?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","The way I would look at the pension, Paul, is we probably have an incremental almost $1.750 billion and we're going to get a 7.5% return on that. So, the O&M benefit would probably be in about the $0.15 range. From an other O&M standpoint, we haven't built anything else in other than it would be flat.","As Chuck said earlier, we are really very cost-effective within our utilities. Any cost reductions within those types of rates would have to be adjusted either through the formula rates or else when we go in for any rate proceedings. On the corporate side, we will continue to look at those cost to see if we can offset that $25 million in depreciation that we're assuming from the competitive side that we do not have anything built into the forecast we've given you.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","And I know it's been like gone over a lot. But just to clarify on tax reform, you're assuming that whatever potential benefit that would not flow through sort of immediately, you would treat, from an accounting perspective, as a deferral. So, from an income statement perspective, you would not be booking any benefit in 2018 or any of the other years? Is that sort of a reasonable way to think about tax reform in terms of your guidance?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","At this point, in our guidance, yes, we don't have any of that benefit baked into our earnings. From a cash flow standpoint, any cash that flows through, it will be upside to us but we don't have anything built into that either in our metrics.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Chuck. How are you thinking about the range of potential outcomes from Mon Power in terms of their supply needs? And when specifically are those supply needs really coming to a head?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I think in the short term, Michael, they would just meet any supply needs from the PJM market. And we are reevaluating what we need to do there. In another two years, we'll need to file another integrated resource plan anyway. But we are not planning to take another attempt at Pleasants, if that's what you're asking.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. I was thinking more in the lines of either new build or acquisition of existing assets that are in the market today but maybe acquiring them at an attractive price for customer and ratepayers?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, at this point, as I said it's too early. We're going to go back and sit down, and Mon Power is looking at all the options. They may, at some point, do another RFP, and I'm sure in that RFP, if they do it, they'll address what FERC determined to be shortcomings in the previous RFP, but it's too early to answer that question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, real quickly, how big of a step-up \u2013 and this may be a Jim or a Steve question, how big of a step-up in transmission revenue are you expecting in 2018 versus 2017? Kind of like what are you baking in, in guidance there?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","At the low end of our guidance, Michael, we're assuming that we'll spend $1 billion in transmission. At the upper end, we would be at the $1.2 billion range. So I think in 2018 we'll have about a normal increase in revenues, as you've seen over the last year or two.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I was just checking because you referenced some of the settlements made in JCP&L, and I didn't know if they gave a one-time boost given the implementation of those this year.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, I would look at probably from a revenue standpoint, our rate base growth will be about $0.07 in 2018 when you compare it to 2017, and then a little bit with the stated rates in JCP&L, that would be about probably another $0.03.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated. Thanks, guys.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just on the New Jersey IIP filing, can you give us some insight into what kinds of things you might consider putting in there? Will it be similar to the $450 million program in Ohio, or is this different kinds of components?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we are developing it right now, Jonathan, and it's too early to talk about. So as soon as we are prepared to disclose it, probably, we will.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's not necessarily it may or may not be the same kind of Distribution Modernization stuff to be up. Thanks.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would say clearly, it will be projects and programs that are designed at improving reliability, improving resiliency, improving safety, security, et cetera, the types of things that the plan was intended for us to try to address.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","And Jonathan, just as you may know, the rule itself provides for project eligibility so, obviously, will stay within the parameters of that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, as we sort of think about scale with the sort of current relative sizes of CapEx in Ohio versus New Jersey be a good place to start thinking about this or not necessarily?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. I think, it'd be on the order with what we filed in Ohio under the Distribution Platform Modernization.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could just on this pension topic, Jim, I just want to clarify the $0.15 you just referenced, is that the sort of bridge between 2017 and 2018?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes. That's correct, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is there any sort of quantifiable benefit from the assumption around slightly lower discount rate that it looks like you're bedding in as you go forward off of 2018 or is that fairly immaterial? I know you do the \u2013 your accounting's little differently.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. There's no benefit associated with the discount rate from an earnings standpoint. But we did, I think, provided a slide and showed what our assumptions were longer term on what the liability would be on a discount rate growing to 4.5%. And if we had to set that discount rate today, it probably already be at 4.25%. So, we think that's a pretty conservative estimate for the liability even.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But that's not driving the earnings guidance basically?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","No, no, no. No impact there.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. And I will literally have one question. So in Ohio, remember we met with the PUCO Chairman and he was emphasizing that your latest ESP included an understanding that the Ohio utilities will be investing in their distribution systems as called upon by the state. So in light of that, how does this $450 million Distribution Modernization plan compare to what this total investment opportunity here is, given what is perceived to be as years of under-investment for the distribution businesses?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","The DMR was about $200 million a year. We just filed a plan to invest $450 million of that into the types of programs that the DMR was intended to contemplate. So, I think we are on track to substantially invest everything that they provided for us in that ESP.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Jones, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay. Thank you and thanks for your continued support of FirstEnergy.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy. Thank you. You may now begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thanks, Brandon, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from this indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.","Participating in today\u2019s call are Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Don Moul, Vice President, Commodity Operations; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Chuck Jones","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share an update on what has been a very busy and productive period for FirstEnergy.","We're continuing to make steady progress on our strategic initiatives, we are achieving closure on several of the industry issues that impact our company and we reported very strong financial results for the second quarter. Our efforts to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service driven growth remained on track and I'm optimistic about our future.","During my remarks today, I will review a number of recent developments and give you a sense of what we are expects for the rest of the year. Following my comments and Jim's review of our financial and operating results, we will have plenty of time for your questions.","Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.53 per share, which is $0.03 above the top of the range we provided in May. These results were higher -- these results were driven by higher earnings and Transmission business and the benefits of our more conservative strategy in our Competitive business.","We continue to make solid progress on energizing the future Transmission initiative, which as you know is expected to be the primary driver of our growth over the next several years.","During the second quarter we completed the project design to support service reliability following the plant deactivations in Northern Ohio and we continue our work to upgrade and strengthen the grid in the ATSI region and support midstream gas operations. We remained on pace to invest $970 million in our Transmission business during 2015 with about 60% of this investment already complete.","This year, we have also put into place the framework to ensure more timely recovery for our Transmission investments. In January, we moved to a forward-looking formula rates structure for ATSI and on July 20th we filed FERC a settlement agreement that maintained at ATSI\u2019s ROE at 12.38% for the first six months of this year.","Under this settlement, which remains subject to FERC approval the rate adjust to 11.06% for the second half of this year and then the 10.38% beginning January 1, 2016, until at least January 1, 2018. The average ROE for the three-year period would be 10.83%.","We're pleased to reach this settlement as it reflects the current Transmission ROE environment and allows us to move forward with our energizing the future Transmission investment plan for customers, while ensuring timely recovery for the company. We expect approval from FERC later this year.","In June we filed requests for authorization to transfer Transmission assets owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L into a new Transmission affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. These assets represent approximately $900 million in rate based as of the end of 2014.","If approved by FERC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, MAIT will operate similarly to our two existing Transmission subsidiaries ATSI and TrAILCo.","We expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for customers of our Eastern utility companies, similar to what we're doing for customers connected to our ATSI Transmission system.","We're seeking approval from FERC in six months and from the State Commissions by mid-2016, prior to closing the transaction MAIT will file for new Transmission rates with FERC.","In May, I outlined three key initiatives that will shape our company going forward. These are the cash flow improvement project, PJM capacity market reforms and our Ohio ESP. Let's start with the results of our cash flow improvement project.","I'm pleased to report that we expect this project to result in cash flow improvement of $58 million in 2015, $155 million in 2016 and $240 million in 2017, exceeding the original targets for all three years.","We launched this project in April with the goal of capturing both immediate and long-term savings that are meaningful and sustainable. We have completed a thorough analysis of savings and process improvements that do not compromise our ability to serve the needs of our organization, our customers and our employees, and we are now moving forward to implement these plans.","These improvements come primarily from our competitive and corporate functions. The largest categories include reducing expenses and capital at our competitive fleet, particularly at our sub-critical fossil units, reducing fossil fuel and fuel-related commodity expenses, and taking advantage of attrition across the company and implemented a selective hiring program.","There are also nearly 100 smaller items that collectively make a strong impact. About 65% of this savings are expected from operating expenses and 35% are from capital and nuclear fuel improvements over the three-year period. On page 170 of our FactBook, which was posted on our website last evening, we include more details on the cash flow initiative.","We've already begun the implementation process, in fact, the majority of the fuel savings that we identified have already been locked in and the new contract pricing will begin in September.","We have also establish a project management office to ensure we capture these savings and are fully committed to successfully executing this plan and establishing a new foundation for FirstEnergy going forward. We believe it will result in a stronger and more flexible company with an improve balance sheet overtime.","Turning to capacity market reforms, during the quarter FERC approved PJM\u2019s new capacity performance rules and as you know FERC issued an order last week allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources into the transitional auctions.","Importantly, the base residual auction remains on track and is still scheduled to begin August 10th. The 2016-17 and 2017-18 transitional auctions were delayed slightly and are now scheduled to begin on August 26th and September 3rd, respectively.","Before I move from general -- generation, let's quickly touch on the Supreme Court decision regarding MATS. While the EPA regulations remain in effect pending further judicial proceedings before the DC Circuit Court, I want to be clear that FirstEnergy is not contemplating reopening any of the units representing 4,769 megawatts of generation that were closed due to cost of compliance with the MATS regulations.","For our remaining fleet we have already spent a significant portion of the $370 million in capital expenditures for equipment upgrades that were required under MATS and many projects are complete or underway.","In our competitive generation fleet, we identified a total cost of $178 million to comply with the regulations, of which $62 million had been spent through June 30th of this year. At our regulated fleet, the cost estimate was $192 million, with $105 million of that spent through June 30th.","I will also mention that we are moving forward with all aspects of the construction of the new dewatering facility for our 2400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield Plant in Pennsylvania. While the plant is still pressured by current market conditions, we believe moving forward with constructions as prudent to ensure that these megawatts remain available to serve customers in 2017 after our disposal rights at Little Blue Run expire. As we've previously mentioned, all costs associated with this project are in our current capital plan.","Finally, let's move to our Ohio and our Electric Security Plan. Based on the current procedural schedule, staff testimony is due August 14, with hearings to begin at the end of the month. As you would expect, we remain very engaged in this process. We filed supplemental testimony in early May to further emphasize the factors that the Ohio commission outlined in the AEP and Duke cases.","It is telling that the public utilities that serve the majority of customers in the state agree conceptually on an appropriate transition plan for the future that ensure safe, reliable, clean and affordable power for all Ohio customers from industrial facilities to homeowners. Given the plan\u2019s benefits, including the economic development support, we believe our filing meets the criteria outlined by the commission and will remain optimistic that this plan will result in sound state energy policy for our customers.","We had a solid first half since the start of the year. We have made tremendous progress toward our goals of investing in customer focus growth supporting sound energy policy and strengthening our company from within. We know there is still work to be done to position FirstEnergy for the future.","At this point, we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 a share to $2.70 a share, with all three of our operating segments turning favorably versus their midpoints. We\u2019re comfortable guiding to the top of this range.","We expect to refine guidance on the third quarter call, once we have seen the full effects of the summer weather. Collectively, the cash flow improvement initiative, upcoming capacity auction results and Ohio ESP decision will drive the near-term financial strategy of our company and give us a much clearer view of the next three years, including earnings and cash flow and a determination on additional equity, if any, to drive growth in our regulated businesses.","In addition, we have already begun our robust annual planning process, which includes updating projections for all of our utilities, especially now that we have the three major rate cases behind us. This effort will help us further refine our distribution utility earnings profile going forward.","Many of you have asked about the status of our analyst meeting. At this time, we still intend to hold it after the outcome of the Ohio ESP, which may push the meeting into early 2016. We look forward to providing you a comprehensive view of our future planning at that time.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of our second quarter financial results.","Jim Pearson","Thanks, Chuck and good morning, everyone. My prepared remarks will focus on the major drivers and events in the quarter. As you know, more details are available in the consolidated report that was posted on our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions either in the Q&A or following the call.","Today we reported strong second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.53 per share, which compares to $0.49 per share last year. On a GAAP basis, basic earnings were $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. GAAP earnings were $0.16 per basic share during the same period last year. As Chuck mentioned, our operating earnings were above our targeted range for the quarter.","Let\u2019s look at the results from each of our segments starting with the distribution business. Residential sales decreased seven-tenths of a percent overall compared to the second quarter of 2014 while commercial sales increased 1%. Adjusting for weather, residential deliveries were down 2.4% and commercial sales were flat.","We are examining the residential usage trend, which has been down over the last four quarters on a weather-adjusted basis. We believe this is attributable to energy efficiency as average customer usage has also declined quarter-over-quarter.","In the industrial sector, sales decreased 1.1% in the quarter, handing a seven quarter run of increased demand from the customer class, primarily due to lower usage from the steel industry. The current rate of shale growth continues to be impacted by soft natural gas prices. While we still see support for more than 1000 megawatts of new load for midstream activities through 2019, our forecast reflects greater confidence in the 2015 and 2016 project, which represents about half of that load growth.","Turning to our transmission business second quarter operating earnings increased $0.06 to-$0.21 per share as a result of revenue increases from a higher rate base at ATSI and a forward-looking rate structure that began in January. In our competitive business, operating earnings $0.01 per share compared to the same period last year, reflecting higher commodity margin associated with higher capacity revenues, a modest increase in wholesale sales and lower contract sales.","Additionally, operating cost decreased year-over-year largely due to improved planned performance. As we said last quarter, we had essentially sold everything we anticipated for 2015 on a retail and forward wholesale basis, with a reserve of 5 million megawatt hours available for spot wholesales through the end of the year. For 2016, about 70% of our expected generation resources are committed and we are currently about 40% committed for 2017.","Based on our results for the first half of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement initiative, we are reaffirming 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the comparative business of $875 million to $950 million and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to $825 million to $925 million from $750 million to $850 million.","It was another solid quarter for our company and this is shaping up to be a good year. As Chuck said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance and the trends we see so far this year, make us confident at the top end of that range at this point. We are committed to achieving the cash savings we have identified and to building long-term shareholder value through our customer focused regulated growth strategy.","Now, with that, I\u2019d like to open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning guys.","Chuck Jones","Hi Dan.","Dan Eggers","Hey Chuck, thanks for the additional detail on the cash flow improvement slides. I guess, in sense of being greedy, two questions, one, what do you see for opportunities, going forward. Can those numbers grow as you kind of get further into the process of evaluation? And then, two, can you talk a little bit of how you really get searched big flow savings out of suppliers, who seem to be pretty in financial dire straits at this point?","Chuck Jones","Well, I\u2019ll take the first question and then I\u2019ll hand the second part of it off to Don Moul to answer. And on the first one, I do think there are some opportunities for us to add to this over time, particularly in the supply chain area, we set a 12-week timeframe to complete this study. We can operate it at that speed but our suppliers don\u2019t unnecessarily operate at that speed. So we\u2019ve got a number of items in the queue that we\u2019re still working on to try to get it across the finish line. So I think there is some opportunity to improve this over time. And I\u2019ll let Don to tackle your fuel question.","Don Moul","Yeah. Thanks Chuck. And so when you take a look at the CFIP savings as you noted, Dan. One of the most significant savings in the initiative comes from reduction in the fossil fuel cost. And that sort of savings is about $151 million, that kind of breaks out as follows, about half or $75 million of the savings is really a result of working with our coal suppliers to get reduced rates.","And then we got about $50 million associated with the refined coal process, where we partnered with several third parties to produce the coal that reduces emissions. We have a contractual relationship, where we paid for every kind of coal that\u2019s treated and the third party receives a tax credit under Sector 45 of the tax code. These contracts are now in place with Sammis and Mansfield Field through 2021, and we are in the final steps of negotiating for Pleasants.","The balance, which is about $25 million, is driven from several smaller writing items, including reagent and waste disposal costs. And as Chuck said, these are already under contract. So that\u2019s part of the write-down of the savings and clearly the coal suppliers are in tight market times as well as we are. We found opportunities to build on our relationships. We\u2019ve got good relationships with our coal suppliers and our transportation suppliers. We meet with them twice a year to work through these market challenges and try to find ways that we can partner in a win-win kind of an approach. So we have been successful so far. We look forward to working with them in the future.","Chuck Jones","I will just follow on the second there, because I know I am going to get this question later. The savings we were able to achieve in the fuel supply, particularly related to the Bruce Mansfield Plant, were a big factor in our decision to move forward with the dewatering facility, makes that plant more competitive starting September 1.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Got it. I guess, can we turn to the Ohio PPA structure and kind of it keeps getting pushed out from a time perspective? Should we read anything to maybe some change in tone at the governor level or at the commission level, if they are interested in doing this? And then do you see any risk to may be interest changing once EPA comes to the carbon rules or once RPM gets out there?","Chuck Jones","I will let Leila to take it and then I may follow on.","Leila Vespoli","Okay. Thanks, Chuck. Hi, Dan. I think the delay in the hearing was in response to the commission desire to get additional data points with regard to what\u2019s happening with the EPA, but I think more precisely what\u2019s happening with the capacity performance. I don\u2019t think that that should be the be-all end-all, I think those are data points, but I also think they are mindful of the fact that our current ESP ends the middle of next year. So there is not a lot of additional delays that could be tolerated within the schedule we need to meet.","So I think we are in a good space right now with regard to the timing of it with hearing starting, August 31. One thing I would like to point out it was after the last call that we continue to be in negotiations. And since our last call, we were able to add [IU] [ph] with the non-opposing party and Kroger as a signed party. So I think what is presented to the commission is a very robust settlement. I am still very hopeful that we will be able to move forward in a very positive way. And as always, we continue to try and bring additional parties on board.","Chuck Jones","So to your question on how does it tie into the clean power plant and other things that are on, I don\u2019t think we have time to wait to see how all of those shake out. There is a sense of urgency here I think around these two facilities in particular that we\u2019ve got to get a decision made about them. So obviously, we are anxious to keep it moving forward.","Dan Eggers","And just to clarify the timeline is, the hearings are August 31, can you just walk through the -- Leila maybe the steps in there to where final resolution should play out if it goes through litigators without a settlement?","Leila Vespoli","So at this point, I would like to say we would get it done by the end of the year, but I am thinking it might slip into the very first part of next year, so early 2016 for a final decision.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead with your questions.","Neel Mitra","Hi, good morning.","Chuck Jones","Hi, Neel.","Neel Mitra","The transmission business seems to be doing well. And I think in the past, you mentioned that maybe about a $1 billion is the maximum you can spend a year. Is that number still right? Or could you deploy additional capital beyond that $1 billion if the process goes well and the Pennsylvania utilities are included in the transfers?","Chuck Jones","Well, I think there are several factors. We\u2019ve communicated our plans for the next several years and they amount to about a $1 billion a year. Meg will provide additional opportunities if we\u2019re successful in getting it done. Our transmission infrastructure has aged, and we\u2019ve talked about a queue of projects that could potentially go on for a long time at the rate of a $1 billion a year.","So I think at that point in time, we would look at it, but I think a determining factor is the ability to resource additional construction. There is a shortage of transmission alignment around our country and that would be a factor in terms of expanding it to any significant amount I think.","Neel Mitra","Got it. And then the second question on Davis-Besse and Sammis, obviously you need both the capacity auction and the PPA for the plants to be successful. How do you philosophically think about the strategy around bidding in the PJM without a PPA resolution in hand?","Chuck Jones","Our attack is to bid those units as competitive units. That\u2019s what they are today. And I would just correct one thing you said, I don\u2019t think we need both. I think we need the PPAs. If we\u2019re successful there what happens in the capacity options, even though they are bid as competitive units that value will flow to customers once the PPA is approved.","Neel Mitra","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Greg Orrill","Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio of the AEP, PPA proposal whether that\u2019s relevant to -- whether you think that\u2019s relevant to your case at all and if you care to comment on whether you think the Supreme Court will take the case?","Leila Vespoli","Greg, this is Leila. I think right now that those appeals are premature. There is still absolute hearing associated with that case in Ohio, I don\u2019t see how you get the Supreme Court to take those up when absolute hearing are pending. So I fully expect those cases, those appeals to be dismissed. Does it mean they can\u2019t refile them at a later date? But again I think they are prematured. So I don\u2019t think they are going to have any affect on our case.","And with regard, I read some conjecture that if they went forward somehow things would be stayed in Ohio as the case is going before the Ohio Supreme Court, the decision goes forward, the commission decision goes forward and is not stayed unless a specific statutory provision is met. And under that provision, the party that is requesting the stay needs to provide and post the bond. So that\u2019s a very high hurdle to assume within the context of this type of cases. So again bottomline, no effect.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","A quick question on the transmission. Again you booked -- you are up I guess $0.11 in the first half of the year. Is there anything in those numbers for the settlements like, have you taken some kind of a charge against the lower ROE this quarter, or is that all to come in H2 when the things finalized?","Chuck Jones","There wasn\u2019t a lower ROE this quarter. We got 12.3% in place for the first six months of 2015, which was a partial contributor to the better performance in the transmission segment.","Jonathan Arnold","Just curious Chuck, whether you might have had to recognize the lower return that will come in the second half of the year ahead of time, but it sounds like none?","Chuck Jones","No, we won\u2019t Jonathan. We will recognize those during the periods that they occur.","Jonathan Arnold","So the moving part, as we think about the second half the transmission is higher rate base having the forward looking test year for the second half of the year and tempered somewhat by ROE?","Chuck Jones","Yes. I would say Jonathan for the second half of year you won\u2019t see the robust growth that we saw in the first quarter. We were up $0.11 year-over-year. For the second quarter or for the second half of the year, you are going to have a much higher rate base that you\u2019re going to compare to in '15 compared to '14. In the first half of 2014 that rate base was based on December 2012 rate base and that carried through for the first five months and that was $683 million. When I look at the comparisons in the second half of 2014, that rate base was going to be about $922 million compared to $1.8 billion. And you are right. The ROE that was used for the second half of last year was 12.38%, and we will recognize 11.06% in the second half of 2015. With that said, I would expect that transmission will trend to the upper end of the range as we said most of our segments are.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. But still the mass, sort more of that, let\u2019s get to that when you add all those parts together.","Chuck Jones","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. So, thank you.","Jim Pearson","Sorry. I just want to add. We are very happy with this settlement. We wouldn\u2019t have settled if we weren\u2019t and if you think about what we are doing $500 million of investment in our transmission business, the difference between 10.38% and 12.38%, adds to maybe $10 million, maybe a penny a half a share overall. But as we talked earlier, the forward-looking rate returns, cash in earnings back to the business faster and more timely given the way we are investing in smaller project to get done quickly.","Chuck Jones","So, we can catch and we think they are getting the clarity on ROE is a big help too. So, I just wanted to understand the mass of bridging the second half.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. Good morning.","Chuck Jones","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, Chuck. Two questions. First, is there any schedule that\u2019s been said so far on the filing on the MAIT approvals, I guess particularly in the states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey?","Leila Vespoli","So, right now interventions were due by July 10th. And right now, I don't see any further procedural schedules that with regard to that although we would expect a decision by December \u201915.","Steve Fleishman","And that\u2019s in which state?","Leila Vespoli","That will occur this year. I\u2019m sorry?","Chuck Jones","Which state?","Steve Fleishman","Where?","Leila Vespoli","So that\u2019s with respect to FERC and then\u2026","Steve Fleishman","Got it, FERC. Okay.","Leila Vespoli","\u2026to Pennsylvania, interventions on August 3rd. Pre-hearing conferences in -- sometime, August, September date and then a decision mid 2016. And with respect to New Jersey, there are no deadline interventions and we would expect an order again with regard to that by mid 2016.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. ","Leila Vespoli","So, no specific hearing dates.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then is there a precedence in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for others that have been able to get kind of existing transmission, kind of separated out.","Leila Vespoli","Yes. Part of our ATSI assets in Pennsylvania. And I believe there are others although they are not on top of mind right now.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Leila Vespoli","There is rail.","Chuck Jones","And power operating company is part of ATSI.","Steve Fleishman","Great. And then just the clarification on the comment on equity. I think you again said that you only would consider equity to a degree that there would be additional growth beyond your current capital plans. Is that correct?","Chuck Jones","What I said in my remarks is once we have -- we've got the cash flow improvements. Once we have the results of capacity performance and once we know where we are at with the ATSI, then we'll look at whether there's an application for equity to stimulate growth both in transmission and distribution if any.","So all along, I do not want to have to use equity to repair our credit metrics and strengthen the balance sheet. That's why we implemented the CFIT project. I think we made substantial progress there as that starts to flow through to strengthening our balance sheet, strengthening our cash flow, strengthening our FFO because about two thirds of it is O&M. And then we'll see where the other two land and then we are going to go from there. And when we have the Analyst Meeting, hopefully, early next year then we will tell you where we are at with that a little more definitively.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your questions.","Shar Pourreza","Good morning.","Chuck Jones","Hi, Shaw.","Shar Pourreza","Just one quick question on the delay of the ESP. Obviously, we just get a little bit of the sense on the status of the upcoming polar auctions and sort of, if there is a potential impact on your hedging profile and obviously you\u2019ve been lowering your weather sensitive hedges. But kind of curious on sort of how we should think about that?","Chuck Jones","So let me answer the first piece of that with regard to the schedule. I do believe that the delay in the schedule was in part a desire and the part of the new administration under the new chair, Andre Porter, to get additional data points before having to make a decision. I think those -- even though the transitional options have been pushed back by the time we complete hearings of those data points will also be known.","So, I don't anticipate further delays. Again, because if for no other reason, we need to secure additional polar auctions for flow to deliver, to be delivered by mid-next year, so I think we are at that point where, hopefully, we are actually going to go-forward at the end of August with hearing. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don with regard to the hedging part of the question.","Don Schneider","As similarly with other market participants, we are going to have to adjust based on what that polar auction schedule is. Obviously, we try to build our planned ratably hedged through the year. If we need to, we will adjust to other channels, including our wholesale channels if we have to sell forward to lock in some of that that volume and eliminate price risk from a portfolio.","Shar Pourreza","Excellent. That was it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning. ","Chuck Jones","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, first question here. In terms of the timing, you obviously talked about at the Analyst Day early next year, but EEI this year in the back half the year in terms of the capital budgeting process and updating us on the outlook for the T&D wires, if you will side of the house holistically. Would you expect to give us an update on the CapEx and perhaps in tandem with that, I suppose balance sheet and cash flow considerations coming out of that?","Chuck Jones","I think at EEI in November, we will give you what we\u2019ve typically given you at the EEI, which is our best look at the future across all of those. Yeah. And we are not going to hold anything back there. But I don't think we can talk about the long-term plan beyond the next couple years until we have the answers to those other two questions that I talked about.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And when you talk about long-term plan, let me just be a little bit clearer if you can or perhaps maybe the Analyst Day a little bit. Are we alluding to the future of the generation business here and how that fits within the context to your business or is the long-term plan more strictly defined within where the long-term trajectory of spend is in the context of your wires business?","Chuck Jones","Julien, since I took over this job, January 1, I bet I've had the questions 500 times, what\u2019s the long-term growth strategy, what's the long-term vision and I think I've answered at the same way 500 times is, I will tell you that once we get a few of these short-term issues out of the way. So, I think it applies to all of that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Chin","Hi. Thanks and good morning.","Chuck Jones","Hi, Brian.","Brian Chin","When FERC made the decision about demand response in the transitional auctions, I was wondering to what extent, does that affect your thoughts with regards to the company's ability to not have to issue equity with regards to the competitiveness if at all.","Chuck Jones","I don't think I've sat here ever thinking about issuing equity for the competitive business. And I think once the results of the cash flow improvement process, which substantial part was a result of the competitive business stepping up. Their particular credit metrics are going to look very strong. It\u2019s going to make a big impact on that part of the company. It makes an impact on the overall First Energy credit metrics too, but a substantial impact inside the competitive business. So, I think we are going to be fine there for the foreseeable future. We already had that business in a position where it was cash flow positive for the next four years. This makes it substantially more cash flow positive, which was the second factor in the decision to go forward with demand still dewatering.","All the CapEx for that project was already in the four-year plan and already in a plan that was cash flow positive but we now got some margin there. And as I\u2019ve said along, the game plan with that business is to keep it cash flow positive and take that positive cash flow and eventually use it to start paying back the holding company for some of the loans that we made to that business a few years ago, so that\u2019s the long-term plan there.","Brian Chin","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your questions.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","First question, so you guys have been -- Chuck, you\u2019ve been making the grounds of the editorial boards. And there have been some interesting quotes and what have you. And I know that sometimes when you're being reported on -- meaning not coming out exactly as you intended it out. But just wondered if you could sort of elaborate a little bit more on your comments about re-regulation, trying to save the company, statements like that? And just how that fits in with this ESP proposal that you have -- the PPA proposal and just sort of comment a little bit more on that?","Chuck Jones","Let\u2019s first talk a little bit about how our newspapers run. We went and met with the editorial board and we had what I thought was a good conversation over an hour and 50 minutes. But then it gets drilled down into an article. Once that articles written then there's a headline writer who goes and writes a headline to try to draw attention to that article. The headlines that was written for that article was completely inaccurate as to anything we discussed during that interview.","In the interview, I was asked a specific question of, are we in anyway working to get the legislature of the state to consider re-regulating and my answer was no. In the context of the discussion about the PPAs, here's my view. We are talking about trying to find ways to preserve major generating assets that have plenty of useful life left in them and keep them from closing prematurely.","Exelon is looking at doing that in Illinois and New York. Ohio utilities are looking at doing it in Ohio. You don't ever hear any conversation about needing to do that in states that are regulated. Regulated states have plenty of generation. They have integrated resource plans and if they need more generation, they either buy or build it, so they are assured they have adequate generation to serve their customers.","So these PPAs, I see as a bridge to keep these plants alive, long enough to allow whatever happens. If our state wants to look at that issue over time, great, but its not going to happen fast enough for these two plants. If we are ultimately able to make significant corrections in the market to make sure they provide for the long-term security of baseload generating facility is great but I don\u2019t think we have time to wait on that either.","And yesterday, the Senate Energy Committee put forth the bill that talks about asking the markets to try to come up with the process to make sure they ensure diversity of both, fuel and types of generating capacity across the markets. We don\u2019t have time to wait on that either. These plants are at risk today and we need to get a decision made as to whether we\u2019re going to look at ways to protect them, so we let all of those debates and legislation in Washington DC and everything else play out.","Paul Patterson","Okay. I appreciate the clarity. Just thought I would hear straight from you. So then the second question I have for you is the fuel saving that you guys have been talking about, how sustainable is that? And do you see potential other opportunities? Or just in other words, it sounds that these steps are one-off? Do you follow what I\u2019m trying to say is, in other words I mean, how should we think about your ability to recognize fuel savings going forward?","Chuck Jones","Well, I\u2019ll let Don ask -- answer it, but my view is they are sustainable. And I met with our fuel team yesterday about how we can get more. So under that context, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don.","Don Moul","Yeah. Thanks, Chuck. And so, I touched on it briefly earlier, but we spent some time working with our key fuel suppliers and really looking for ways that can make us more competitive in the marketplace, while still keeping them viable in a tough marketplace for coal suppliers as well.","Are there more opportunities, as Chuck mentioned? We\u2019re looking for those opportunities. But it\u2019s going to probably take some innovative approaches and working with our suppliers to get there, given the economics that we see right now.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. I appreciated. Thanks a lot.","Chuck Jones","I mean, obvious context is that, the competitive generating fleets, both nuclear and fossil are under duress as a result of current market conditions. The second industry that\u2019s under equal or maybe the more duress is the coal industry. And I think, what we\u2019re trying to do is work together, partner together for the survival of both.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But the nuclear fuel was in the free cash flow, seems to have come down your projection for that in 2015? Is that part of the savings or is that something else?","Chuck Jones","There are some savings in there for nuclear fuel. And essentially, what we did there is we were looking at procuring additional nuclear fuel to take advantage of the very low prices of uranium that there are in the market today, way ahead of when we needed it.","We don't need it for a number of years yet. We decided not to do that mainly on the basis that -- as we assess that uranium market, we think the pricing is going to stay where it\u2019s at for a long time and so, there was no urgency to try to need to capitalize on that this year.","Paul Patterson","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from lines of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Most of the all my questions have been answered already. I\u2019m just wondering in the context of your guide, telling us that you\u2019re trending toward the high-end of the guidance range for \u201915, is that you\u2019re trending toward the high-end of the guidance range in all three segments\u2026","Chuck Jones","Yes.","Greg Gordon",".. or you\u2019re doing better than expected in some in towards the midpoint of this?","Chuck Jones","We are above the midpoint in all three segments through six months. And that combined with the CFIP results that we talked about that we\u2019re going to get in the second half of the year, are what cause us to say we can point you to the high-end of the guidance. So if you follow-on questions, well, why don't you just kind of change your guidance.","The answer is we got $1.15 in the bank through six months. Our midpoint of our original guidance was $2.55, that means we got a $1.40 that we've got to capture the second half of the year just to get to the midpoint and the $1.55, we\u2019ve got to capture to get to the high-end of the range and we\u2019ve got a lot of very volatile weather months in the third quarter and a big third quarter.","So, we just decided we\u2019re going to wait, see what happens in July and August in particular and then at the end of the third quarter, when we do this call at the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll tell you where we expect to be more definitively at that time.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So if whether normal or better for the rest of the year than you\u2019re comfortable that you\u2019re going to be at the high-end?","Chuck Jones","Yes.","Greg Gordon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. I have a capacity performance related question for you. Can you talk a little bit about given your largely coal and nuclear, what you physically done at the plants to prepare yourself to where you wouldn\u2019t -- you would be able to reduce the risk of having to pay penalties for failure to perform when called an emergency hours. What have you done different physically at the plant to prepare for this relative or compare to what you did in prior years?","Chuck Jones","Well, I would say this, we did a number of things to prepare our plants for the winner of 2014, \u201815 and order to insure they operated reliably for this winner even in an environment were they weren\u2019t any penalties.","As far as how we look at that going forward, we\u2019re going to make that determination in terms of how much you\u2019re willing to spend on reliability improvement versus where the capacity performance market clears.","And in terms of the specific numbers, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to talk about those at this time. We need to see where both the base residual auction and then we\u2019re in particular the transaction auctions clear, because those are the more eminent. For the base residual, you got three years to figure how to get your units reliable for that one. The transition auctions are a little more pressing in terms of time. So we\u2019ll make those determinations once we see where the auction results come out.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciate it.","Chuck Jones","Okay. Michael.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning.","Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Paul Ridzon","Can you just talk about how you beat your guidance, kind of what the areas of strength were? And then I have a follow-up question after that.","Chuck Jones","Jim.","Jim Pearson","You are talking about our guidance for the third quarter, Paul?","Paul Ridzon","Second quarter.","Jim Pearson","Okay. For the second quarter, we looked at where we though we would be based on our plan. We did come about above the high end of our guidance. We defer some of our plant outages to later in the year.","So we picked up a couple cents there. Distribution, they performed a little bit better, slightly lower O&M, and then we had slightly better results from our transmission business that we\u2019ve already talked about. So that\u2019s really what drove us above the top end of the guidance in the second quarter.","Paul Ridzon","And are you still with your charges at the competitive business to reposition the portfolio?","Jim Pearson","They will be substantially finished by the end of 2015 with only a minor amount carrying over the '16.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey. Good morning, Chuck. Just I guess a PPA type question. Since the last call, you\u2019ve had the governor of Ohio announced his intention of obtaining the Republican nomination. Does that complicate the PPA process because sometimes you have campaigns that are more interested in what\u2019s better for a national audience and maybe not focused on what would be beneficial to like Ohio customers or Ohio rate bears in this case?","Chuck Jones","My view would be I think it's a non-factor. I think the governor's decision to run for a President is a political decision and it affects things that might happen politically. I think he's made it clear all along that he expects that you\u2019ll have Public Utilities Commission to look at this issue and make an informed decision on this issue. So I don't think that would change as a result of this decision.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Chuck Jones","Okay. I don\u2019t see any more questions in the queue. So we\u2019re going to actually end few minutes earlier here. I want to thank everybody for your support and obviously we feel good about where we are at for -- Philson just popped in there. So I\u2019m going to stop and let Philson ask his question.","Operator","Thank you. Philson Yim with Luminus, please go ahead with your question.","Philson Yim","Just talk about that the $1.55 to capture high end for the rest of the year? On LTM, transmission is basically R&D at a midpoint is basically what I see. Is that right?","Chuck Jones","Yeah. That\u2019s correct, Philson.","Philson Yim","And do you expect transmission to only grow kind of $0.04 for the balance of the year to get to the high end or are there offsets there?","Jim Pearson","No. I won\u2019t say there is any offset. I talked a little bit earlier. I don't think you'll see the growth in the revenues that you did see in the first half. You saw $0.20 there in the first half. We\u2019ve guided to the $0.30 for the year. I think we\u2019re going to be slightly above that. Some of the offsets that you saw during the first half were depreciation general taxes and interest.","They will probably be about in line the second half of the year as they were at the first half of the year. So I think we will trend as Chuck said to the upper end of the range on transmission, but it's not going to be same $0.11 that you saw in the first half.","Philson Yim","Okay. Thank you. And distribution, to the midpoint there is a $0.10 drop year-over-year expected? But year-to-date, you guys are tracking at, are there offsets expected in the second half of the year?","Jim Pearson","Yeah. Right now, Philson, we are tracking about $0.01 behind where we\u2019re last year, and we guided you to about $0.11 behind. There is a few offsets. We had some improvement in distribution. We\u2019ve been helped somewhat by weather and the earlier part of the year. So I would not expect based on normal weather going throughout the rest of the year that we would drop down to the $0.11 that we guided you to.","Philson Yim","Got it. Thank you.","Jim Pearson","That will be at upper end also.","Philson Yim","Thank you very much. Sorry to everyone for extending the call.","Chuck Jones","We had a bet when I was going out and you cost me a lunch. Now, thanks to everybody as I said. I think we are off to a great start this year. We feel good about the results. I will tell you, I am constantly impressed with our team here and whatever we asked them to deliver they find a way. Under Donny's leadership, this cash flow improvement team exceeded my expectations.","I don't know what your expectations were when I told you we were going to get to $200 million but they exceeded my expectations. And we are working hard to and we\u2019ll capture those savings over the next couple years. So thanks for your support and we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call and probably many of you in between. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation."],"9587":["FirstEnergy Corp.

Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's third quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a PowerPoint presentation, which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we reported very strong third quarter results. Our GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share. Our operating earnings of $0.97 per share not only exceeded the third quarter of 2016, but also surpassed our guidance range. This was possible in part, thanks to another very solid quarter in the regulated business, as well as stronger-than-expected results in our Competitive and Corporate segments. Above all, it reflects our teams' laser focus on costs, cash and operational performance and our track record of execution.","I'm pleased to note that we are now closing in on three straight years of exceeding or meeting the midpoint of operating earnings guidance we provided to investors. As always, Jim will provide more details on our quarterly financial results later in the call.","Now, let's move to a discussion of some of the key developments across our company. We'll start with our regulated businesses, where we are building a platform for sustained customer service focused growth.","In our transmission business, our Energizing the Future initiative continues to reduce predictable results and we remain on pace with our investments as we expand our grid modernization and reliability work into the eastern part of our service territory. As we have discussed, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both our JCP&L transmission assets and our Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary, known as MAIT, in March. These rates went into effect on June 1 and July 1 respectively, subject to refund, pending the outcome of hearing and settlement proceedings.","While the JCP&L case remains pending and the MAIT case, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with FERC earlier this month with a proposed 10.3% return on equity. We expect FERC to rule on this settlement agreement in the next several months.","Moving to our distribution business, the narrative for the third quarter follows the themes we discussed during the first half of the year. Results improved compared to the same period in 2016 due to the new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. Weather had a significant impact year-over-year, while cooling degree days were slightly higher than normal during the third quarter of 2017.","The temperatures were far more moderate than we experienced last year, which was the hottest summer in our service area in more than four decades. That tough weather comparison aside, our load trends are a good news story. On a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries to residential and commercial customers continue to come in better than our forecast. And for the year, we remain optimistic that these load improvements will offset the mild temperatures from earlier this year, which is in line with our discussion last quarter.","In the industrial class, the third quarter load growth of 1.2% was driven largely by the shale gas, steel and petroleum industries. This continues a positive trend in this segment, where we've now experienced five consecutive quarters of growth. Our teams have been updating our load analysis for 2018 and beyond and we plan to discuss our outlook with you at EEI next week.","Before I wrap up the discussion of our utility business, I want to extend my thanks to our employees who traveled south in September to assist with Hurricane Irma. Overall, more than 630 FirstEnergy employees assisted with the restoration effort and they continue to receive notes of thanks from those affected by the storms. This hurricane season was a stark reminder to many of the importance of a reliable and resilient electric grid for customers and our nation's economy.","We commend Secretary Perry and the Department of Energy for recognizing this and for taking action to help prevent additional premature closures of U.S. fuel-secure baseload generating assets. As you know, in late September, the Secretary of Energy proposed the adoption of a rule by FERC to correct faulty market conditions and keep essential fuel-secure baseload generating plants operating. We believe this should help ensure customers continue to receive safe, reliable and affordable supplies of electricity, while maintaining the security of the electric grid. And we filed comments in testimony earlier this week, expressing our strong support for the Resiliency Pricing Rule.","We were also pleased to see the broad bipartisan support for this measure expressed in both houses of the Pennsylvania legislature earlier this week. At the state level too, we are encouraged to see a renewed effort to preserve essential generation. While the Ohio legislature was on recess this summer, we continued working on a modified approach to help compensate the state's nuclear plants for the fuel diversity, environmental and other benefits that they provide.","This month, Representative DeVitis along with 15 bipartisan co-sponsors from across the state introduced House Bill 381 called Ohio Clean Energy Jobs, which essentially reworked the zero emission nuclear proposal. This bill would create a program to help protect the state's nuclear plants and ensure they continue to support well-paid jobs, economic growth, reliable and affordable electricity generation and environmental progress.","Proposal caps impact on both residential and non-residential customers and reduces the length of the program to 13 years. While revenue resulting from this legislation will be a reduction from the previous versions, it would likely make the plants economically viable, particularly in a restructuring scenario at FES. We believe this effort is imperative for Ohio's energy security.","The Ohio House Public Utilities Committee is expecting to hold hearings on the bill over the next several weeks with a vote possible before year-end. We expect the final vote in the legislature around the middle of the first quarter. Whether these state or federal activities result in meaningful and timely support remains to be seen, but it is encouraging to see the much needed attention on these very important issues.","At the federal level, the rule-making provision utilized by Secretary Perry has only been used once before by an Energy Secretary and I believe that underscores how serious the administration is about these concerns. Both FirstEnergy and FES Board will continue to watch these near-term developments with interest. At the same time, FirstEnergy continues our efforts to exit commodity-exposed generation.","There have been a number of additional developments on that front since our last call. So, I'll take a few minutes to provide an update on our progress. In late-August, we entered into a revised agreement for the sale of competitive natural gas and hydroelectric generation owned by our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Under the terms of the revised agreement, 1,615 megawatts of assets will be sold to LS Power for an all-cash price of $825 million, subject to certain adjustments.","As you will recall from our conversation last quarter, we originally entered into an agreement for this sale in January and FERC granted approval of the original transaction in June. The revised agreement includes four natural gas power stations in Pennsylvania, our competitive interest in the Bath County Hydro station and adds our interest in the Buchanan gas facility, both of which are in Virginia. The transaction involving the four natural gas stations in Pennsylvania is expected to close this year, while the sale of the interest in the Bath County and Buchanan facilities is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.","One of the closing conditions is that LS Power must reach an agreement with us and the other owner of the Bath County facility with respect to the operations of that plant. We are hopeful that, that process will be completed soon.","In West Virginia, Mon Power continues to work through the regulatory process to complete the purchase of Allegheny Energy Supply's 1,300-megawatt Pleasants plant. We continue to expect final approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC by early 2018.","Net proceeds to Allegheny Energy Supply from these two transactions are expected to be about $350 million after paying off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole premium payments. We expect that the proceeds will be invested in FirstEnergy's unregulated money pool.","As we previously mentioned, FirstEnergy and FES each have a fully engaged team of financial and legal advisors who are assisting with our exit from the commodity-exposed generation business. FES held initial discussions with its creditor advisors in early September and the parties have continued their dialogue since then, primarily focused on due diligence and providing an understanding of the FES operations and its financial projections.","It is our understanding that the creditor groups that have formed represent a large group of the Bruce Mansfield sale leaseback noteholders as well as the secured and unsecured pollution control notes. FirstEnergy is not currently involved in these discussions, but we would participate when it's appropriate. In a restructuring scenario, a preferred outcome would be agreement with creditors.","At this time, FirstEnergy continues to provide FES access to the unregulated money pool. As of the end of September, FES, its subsidiaries and FENOC had net borrowings of $67 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect them to have a neutral to slightly invested position in the unregulated money pool by the end of March 2018. This forecast includes a series of debt service and lease payments totaling $88 million between now and March, $48 million of which is due on December 1.","The FES Board has the responsibility of deciding whether FES will seek protection under a Chapter 11 filing and they have several key considerations in making that decision, including the outlook for the DOE's proposed rule and FERC's actions as well as the status of discussions with creditors' advisors.","With almost 10 months behind us, 2017 is shaping up to be a positive year for our company, with strong financial and operational performance as well as progress on our regulated initiatives. Last night, we announced that we increased our GAAP forecast for the full year of 2017 to a range of $2.02 to $2.42 per share. This takes into account an estimate of our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment.","On an operating earnings basis, our utility and transmission businesses are solidly on track to achieve their targets in 2017. With better than expected performance in Corporate and our Competitive business, we are raising our full-year guidance to a range of $3 to $3.10 per share, above the upper end of the previous range. As always, we intend to continue positioning FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit shareholders, customers and employees.","Thank you for your time and I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the discussion of our results, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website. Our strong operational performance and financial discipline across the company are reflected in our third quarter 2017 GAAP results and our operating earnings, which as Chuck said, came in well above our guidance for the quarter.","Third quarter earnings in the distribution business increased by $0.05 per share compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was driven by the new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. Cooling degree days were 3% above normal, but 27% lower than the same period of 2016. This drove a 7% decrease in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2016, with sales to residential customers decreasing 14% and commercial deliveries down 6%.","On a weather-adjusted basis however, total distribution deliveries increased slightly in the residential and commercial sectors compared to the third quarter of 2016. And industrial sales continued their positive trend, with growth of more than 1% compared to last year.","In our transmission business, third quarter earnings benefited from higher revenues, resulting from our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program. In the Competitive business, our results were flat compared to the third quarter of 2016. While commodity margin reflects lower contract sales rates and the expected decline in retail sales, it was offset by lower operating expenses, including depreciation, O&M, fuel and general taxes.","FES' total retail customer count is now about 842,000 compared to 1.4 million a year ago. We are raising our 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the Competitive business to $525 million to $555 million, primarily reflecting the delay in the Allegheny Supply gas and hydro asset sale and lower operating expenses.","We are very pleased with our results for the first three quarters of the year and the progress we've achieved on our strategic initiatives and we are especially pleased that S&P updated its outlook of FirstEnergy in August from negative to stable, reflecting their confidence in our efforts to become fully regulated. We will continue our focus on meeting our commitments to shareholders and executing our regulated growth plans.","Before we open the lines for your questions, Chuck has an additional comment.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Jim. I know you're eager to ask questions and I won't keep you long, but I wanted to take this opportunity to reinforce an important message. I've always said I believe very strongly in transparent communications and today we provided a comprehensive update on the status of affairs at FES.","So, while I'm sure you will have many questions about the status of negotiations with creditors and their advisors, we have been very clear that we will not conduct these negotiations in public. We recognize the varied interests of our stakeholders, but we're also aware that some have an interest in floating rumors about our company. I urge you to only rely on information that comes directly from us and you will only find that in a public forum or filing.","Now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the results.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Julien. Welcome back.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you so much. So, perhaps I'll try to be diplomatic about this. With respect to the FES situation and the DOE efforts, can you give us a little bit of a sense on how the timeline itself might be shifting? Obviously, there's a number of factors. Are you thinking that there could be some sort of attempt to wait it out to see what happens out of this process, obviously, they're trying to be expedited and\/or any legislative efforts? How might all three, with respect to timing, tie into each other?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Julien, I don't think there's any connection between them. We're moving forward with our efforts to exit the commodity-exposed generation business. I mentioned that we began or FES began discussions with the creditors in September. Those discussions are ongoing. I know that they opened up a data room and there's a lot of due diligence going on. I think that's going to probably take some time to get to closure. And I said in my remarks, I think the preferred outcome is to get a settlement with creditors.","So, the DOE effort, if it stays on the track that the Department of Energy set up, which is an end of December 11, I think that they're going to happen all in the same timeframe, but I don't think there's any delays going on anywhere. We're moving forward and we're watching to see what happens out of the DOE.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then, secondly, I just want to set the record straight a little bit. What is your attitude towards retaining any of the legacy assets in an attempt to negotiate something? I don't want to talk about the negotiations per se, but what is the palatability of retaining, for instance, any of the nuclear assets? I just want to be very clear about this one, particularly if you are successful with legislation and\/or anything else to kind of change the view of it being perhaps a little bit more contracted like than not","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I want to be very clear too. FirstEnergy's strategy is to become fully regulated. We have no interest in maintaining generating assets that have commodity exposure and we're moving forward with exiting the commodity-exposed generation business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you so much for the transparency.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","First, I just wanted to clarify, I think, Chuck, you said that you were going to be giving at EEI an update on the load analysis.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I want to make sure I heard that right, but does that suggest a more kind of holistic update of your outlook or what else should we expect at the conference just in terms of broad outline?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we don't want to give it all away today, but, yeah, I think you would expect a little more holistic look at what's happening with our loads and any impact that might have on the growth rates that we've given previously. And we plan to give you a more clearer view of where we think our future is right now.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, thank you for that. And secondly on, you talked about the Corporate segment, an outperformance there having been a driver of the guidance raise. Can you give us a little more what's driving that and whether you'd see that flowing through beyond this year?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Jonathan, this is Jim. That's primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate slightly offset by the bond offering that we did earlier this year. So, we would expect that benefit to carry through to the remainder of the year and that's where we updated our guidance there midpoint.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, if I may, just given the commentary around the commitment to exit the Competitive business and see that through, if we kind of fast forward to when you reach that point, how will you think about your equity financing needs once you're in that more stable setup? Should we think of the sort of ongoing issuance that you talked about last year as part of the plan or could you see a scenario where you'd want to put some of that behind you more up front?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, we have publicly stated an intent to issue $1.5 billion of additional equity between now and the end of 2019. We intend to move forward with that. I would say we reserve the right to decide how and when to do that, but the total amount isn't going to change and it's going to be done by the end of 2019.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you very much, Chuck.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to discuss the Department of Energy proposal. If FERC did decide to go ahead and move forward with what the Department of Energy has recommended, but the proposal gets mired in legal challenge, would that be enough for you all to decide to retain the business, because after all I guess really under the DOE approach, the assets effectively would be contracted utility-like assets or would that not be enough for you to want to retain the business?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, Stephen, let me just say this. I don't think the DOE initiative has anything to do with FirstEnergy despite what's been reported in some of the media. I think it has to do with preserving critical fuel-secure baseload generating facilities. And I think that that's what it will do whether FirstEnergy owns them or whether FES creditors own them or whether FES creditors sell them to a third party that we don't even know of today. I think the most important thing that they are focused on is correcting the market deficiencies that do not compensate these plants for the attributes that they bring to the grid. Beyond that, I don't think it's appropriate for me to speculate on any outcomes. When we have the outcomes, we'll react to them.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then, just shifting gears over to Pleasants, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit further about next steps in terms of the process of approval and just what we should be looking out for there.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Stephen, this is Leila. So, the hearing process is complete. The briefs are in and we will be expecting a commission decision. There's no timeline in which they have to act, but we are hopeful that we will receive an order in the first quarter of next year. With regard to the FERC piece of that, I believe January 18 is the date by which FERC would have to act. So if the West Virginia Commission were so inclined and wanted to see what was happening there, they might act after that. So, that's the timeline associated with Pleasants right now.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Okay. So first, a question about equity. So, it's the end of October. I know you guys mentioned that you would be issuing equity late this year. How should we think about it? Are you going to try to infuse equity into your pension plan or is it going to be a block equity sometimes in late fourth quarter?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, Angie, we haven't decided yet and I would say, when we issued it into the pension plan last year, it was I think a very successful way to do it. But as I said, we are committed to doing $1.5 billion between now and the end of 2019. We're reviewing the timing of that all the time and we'll go to our board at the appropriate time when we're ready to do that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Understood. Secondly, okay, so it's a bit of a surprise, I think, at least to us that the state legislative initiatives that support you nuclear asset is progressing given the fact that the governor has been opposed to it. So, what has changed? Do you think that this DOE NOPR has changed the minds of the legislators? I mean, do you think that if New Jersey and now Connecticut stand by their nuclear plants, that's going to actually sway the legislature or the governor?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think it's all of the above. I think the fact that New York and Illinois have \u2013 already taking measures to protect these fuel-secured nuclear facilities in particular, the DOE initiative on top of it, the fact that other states concurrently are looking at it, all are creating an awareness about what's going on in our nation and the importance of these assets to not only physical security, but also economic security. So, I don't think it's a surprise that Ohio is willing to relook at it. I think we've got to deal with the legislature first. And then, once we have the legislature passing the bill, then we'll see where the governor really is at that time.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Kind of lastly, obviously, don't want to steal the thunder from the EEI, but are you trying to suggest that the higher load growth at the T&D business could warrant higher CapEx? Is that what you're suggesting?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I am not suggesting anything specifically. We're still, as I said, finalizing our load projections and we'll just give you the whole picture at EEI.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","I see that when I look on page \u2013 trying to find it here, sorry, yeah, page 17 of your presentation, you footnoted the impact of pension OPEB. I know you take \u2013 make one-time adjustments every year and you've given us those impacts here. Are those \u2013 those discount rates are down, is that around 25 basis points from the prior assumptions? Is that correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's correct, Greg. Last year, when we made our actuarial assumption, we had a discount rate of 4.25%. Right now, it's just above 4%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then, when I skip forward to page 31, where you give us the FE parental guarantees and other assurances to FES, we have a $712 million unfunded pension and OPEB obligation as of 12\/31\/16. Should we assume that, that number is going to go up as a reflection of the lower discount rates when you give us the year-end number?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, Greg. That'll go up slightly and we'll revise that when we get to the end of the year and finalize what our actual returns were on the assets as well as what the final discount rate is. And as you know, we don't measure that until December 31. It's whatever the rate is at the end of the year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Have you given rules of thumb in the past as to what change in discount rate might mean to those \u2013 to that balance before performance offsets?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","No. We've never done that for FES in particular, but the rule of thumb on a change in the discount rate, it impacts liability by about $250 million.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","But that's across the whole company?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's across the whole company. That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","And a subset of that would be at the utilities, which is recoverable and the subset of that would be at FES, where it would increase this exposure, correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please state your questions.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Chuck, Jim. Just, I guess, one question on the sales update. Could you just maybe remind what your prior projections were in the plan that you gave? I guess, the last time you gave plan was really last year's EEI for sales growth?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes. Steve, last year, we had pretty much a flat overall growth. We had a slight decline in residential and commercial offset with an increase in industrial, but for total, it was less than a 1% growth rate.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then, on the proceeds that you're going to get to $350 million that you talked to from the kind of AES, you're going to leave that in the unregulated money pool?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, that's right. I mean there'll be about $350 million left after we paid down debt as well as the make-whole premium and that $350 million will just go into the money pool. That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And are you going to kind of leave it there till FES has resolved or can you bring that into FE Corp. essentially?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","That will come into FE Corp.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. I will leave it at that. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. Question on the regulated side of the shop. First of all, can you give an update for your expectations of where the New Jersey infrastructure strawman process kind of goes? And second, if the strawman doesn't happen, when do you think you would potentially file again in New Jersey?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I'll take the first half, and I think it's really great to be in a position in New Jersey to even be having discussions with the BPU about a going-forward view of infrastructure improvement. And we're going to keep those discussions going and we hope to get resolved with something that we can both mutually agree to. Beyond that, I'll turn it over to Leila to answer the second question.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, I assume you were referring to the infrastructure investment program and the proposed rules, which we are hoping that will be in place by the end of the year, very similar with some of the mechanisms, if you would, to the disc in Pennsylvania and, as Chuck alluded to, a very positive move for New Jersey. So, we will be looking at that just like we did in Pennsylvania to provide a program under it. If we don't use that, we always on a continuous basis in New Jersey and across all our states continue to monitor and see when a rate case may be justified.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Based on your last rate case, I forget, when can you file again?","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't think we have a moratorium, but...","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No restriction in New Jersey, but there's no date certainly for a filing. We'll file when we think it's appropriate.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Chuck, thanks, Leila, much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Actually almost everything I have was answered. Just a really quick one, on the MAIT settlement, why did it cause an impairment? It wasn't a big one. So, I'm sort of wondering why that happened.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","There was some regulatory assets that we had on the books, Paul, that as part of the settlement process we agreed to not to recover those. So, we took the impairment this quarter.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And what were those assets associated with?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Vegetation management and storm costs, deferred storm costs.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got it. Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks guys. So firstly, on the increased guidance for 2017, it looks like a majority of it is CES. Is the delay in asset close or the delay in the close of a transaction part of the reason for that or is it purely driven by market prices and the other factors you mentioned in the call?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, you got it. A portion of that increase is associated with the delay in the asset sale, but we've also had some favorable O&M. Beaver Valley 2 as well as Perry, they returned from their outages a little sooner than we had expected. We had a property tax settlement in Ohio that has improved that somewhat and we've also seen some improvements in our nuclear decommissioning, which drove some of the increase.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, but how much would you attribute to the delayed close, because the jump is quite meaningful? So wanted to understand how much was all the other factors and how much was just the fact that you had the assets for a little longer?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I'd say about $0.06 is associated with the delayed sale. We had about a $0.07 improvement in our O&M. Property taxes were a couple cents and the NDT was about $0.03. So, that gets you to the $0.18.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's super helpful color. And then, secondly, on the asset sale itself, it seems like quite a bit was renegotiated, right? The price came down by $100 million. You added some more assets and then you have to pay out the $100 million for the change in control on the debt. I was just trying to understand what triggered all of that? Like what drove that significant change in the price and the fact that you had to pay for the change in control?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Really, the change in control, the calling of that debt, we had generally always expected that we would have to do that. The $100 million change is just, I would say the sale was priced on the existing market conditions. And really, the other assets that we included, the Buchanan, I don't have the exact \u2013 I think it was only like 61 megawatts or something like that. It was a very, very small addition of assets.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Understood. And then just finally, in terms of the parental support from FE to FES, obviously there's the pension OPEB and you've provided great color in the past in terms of what FE is supporting FES with. Is there an update on that? Is that something you aim to provide on a regular basis, so we know all the different components? Obviously, there's some money pool and some other liabilities, but wanted to get more clarity on all the different pieces.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. I think we've laid out all of the guarantees on one of our slides in the presentation, so that they're still pretty consistent. And as we said earlier on the call, the money pool is about $67 million right now and we would expect through the forecast period we have through March of next year that the money pool would probably go down to about zero to possibly some money actually invested in the money pool. So other than that, that's everything we have out there and nothing's changed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Super helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Jim, you guys obviously had a very successful bond issuance and refinancing back in early June. Could you just give us an update on your thoughts on parent-level credit capacity versus kind of where you stand today?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","From our standpoint, we did have a very successful bond offering. From my standpoint, I don't see us increasing that capacity any. In fact, I think Chuck and I would like to decrease the leverage at the holding company somewhat. We do have capacity where we could issue several billion dollars more in debt, but that is not in any of our plans at this point.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's pretty clear I think. And then, Chuck, I respect that you don't want to give any extra detail on the negotiations with creditors, but I did want to just clarify some comments in your prepared remarks. Is it fair to say you've had or the FES Board has had two separate meetings with some creditor group since the last earnings call and that that creditor group, to your knowledge, represents a meaningful portion of the outstanding bondholders?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","In my prepared remarks, I said there have been meetings. I have no idea how many meetings they've had, but I do understand that it represents a broad spectrum of the bondholders and a majority of the bondholders from what FES has communicated.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks. I guess that DMR comes up for renewal, when would you expect \u2013 would you expect to file sometime next year, I guess, for the two-year extension or when would you plan on filing?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Paul, you're right. Right now, it's a three-year period. It goes through 2019. It's our expectation that we'd likely file early in 2019 for that extension.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then, you talked about certain changes that are required for the Bath transaction to basically close. Can you provide sort of any insight as to what those changes might involve?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Not changes, Paul. We need an operating agreement between the owners and there are multiple owners. And we're just working through the process of getting that operating agreement completed. When that's completed, the transaction can go forward.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Right. But I mean, as I recall, that was a complicating factor sort of the first time around, right, that there were required changes that needed to be made to the operating agreement and it sounded as if that didn't happen. And then, you went through the whole renegotiation process. So, is there something that would make those changes more likely this time than in the sort of the previous round?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't think there's any issue with getting an operating agreement in place other than the time that it takes to do it.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then, lastly, in terms of liquidity, it looks as if there's adequate liquidity at least until March of 2018 with respect to FES. Is there anything else that you would see that would potentially precipitate a filing sort of earlier than the liquidity sort of concerns that you've outlined?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I'm not going to speculate on behalf of the FES Board what might drive their decisions. So, there's nothing that is material that we haven't communicated.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I just had a quick follow-up on the guidance. The $0.07 you mentioned on O&M, was that purely related to the shorter outages than planned?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Majority of it, Paul, was associated with the outages. There has been a little bit less than advisory costs than what we had expected. And we've also had some lower expenses associated with our retail program, but the majority of it would be associated with planned outages.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, the property taxes, that should be ongoing. Is that fair?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, yes, that is new appraisal values for the plants.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, decommissioning trust will be what the market does, okay.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, that could go up or down based on how the market performs.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Transmission CapEx, you had a fairly wide range of guidance, $800 million to $1.2 billion, at least that's the last fact book. I think that's still current. I suspect that the MAIT settlement doesn't really drive that from the lower-end in that range just because it's small. I suspect that reaching an agreement on FES doesn't really drive things, because you're not putting much money, much capital in FES anymore. What drives that then from the $800 million or the $1.2 billion over the next five years?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","We just put that range in there. If we get some distribution riders or some additional spend in distribution, we might diverge some of our capital there. But I think from our standpoint, you would look at probably about an average of $1 billion a year. You're right, the MAIT settlement with a 10.3% ROE, that's consistent with what we're earning in our ATSI program. So, I think it's just a range to determine where we wanted to devote our capital to.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And then, when you settled the ATSI at the 10.38%, I think one of the statements you said, Jim, was that because of all the small projects you were doing, having that settlement, getting the framework in place was important. Is that the same thing with MAIT that take the lower ROE, but to have this framework, have the ROE status is critical?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, I think it's important to get that settled. We believe that the 10.3% rate, it is consistent with current market conditions and consistent with our other transmission. So, we think it's valuable to get it settled and get the rates in place and move forward and start devoting some capital there.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thanks.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","And the projects that we're doing are very similar to what we talked about before. We're just moving them east. They're generally smaller projects that get completed and there was a lot of regulatory lag under our lagging formula rate that we don't have any more.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, fine. I'll save the rest for EEI. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Please go ahead with your questions.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Chuck, real quick one. At what point do you feel comfortable or believe that FE will be back in the position, where the company is going to be back in a position to kind of contemplate dividend growth again?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I think first of all, we've got to get this exit of commodity-exposed generation behind us, Michael, and understand what the going-forward state of our company is. Where our dividend's at today, I don't think there's any reason that we would need to think about increasing it, because it's a very competitive dividend and we'll deal with that down the road once we get through this strategic restructuring of our company.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.","Irene Prezelj","Thanks, Melissa. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects.","These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles Jones","Thank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. We had a great quarter, and I'm pleased to have this chance to speak with you about our results and our progress on key initiatives. Since our last call in August, we have successfully carried out several of the critical steps necessary to complete our transition to a fully regulated utility.","As I'm sure you know, on September 25, the bankruptcy court approved our definitive settlement agreement in the Chapter 11 proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions, its subsidiaries and FENOC. This very positive development marks perhaps the most important milestone in our exit from competitive generation. While you may occasionally see news about the progress of FES, FENOC and their affiliates, as they work with the bankruptcy court. To be clear, we expect that none of this will impact our ability to execute our regulated strategy.","We're also in the final stages of implementing our FE Tomorrow initiative, which will align our cost structure and shared services workforce to efficiently and effectively support our regulated businesses going forward. In total, 960 positions in our shared service organization were impacted by this effort. In addition to the nearly 500 employees, who accepted our voluntary enhanced retirement package, we eliminated nearly 230 open positions, transition some employees into opportunities in our utility business and created a flatter, leaner management structure by reducing layers and increasing spans of control.","As part of this streamlining effort, there are nearly 45% fewer leadership positions in our shared services organization, including 46 Director, Executive Director and Vice President positions and 163 supervisory and manager level positions. The majority of these organizational changes went into effect during the third quarter.","As part of the FE Tomorrow effort, our teams identified opportunities that will eliminate the $300 million of cost that were associated with our competitive operations. In addition, we expect to fully offset the $30 million of depreciation, associated with common systems shared with FES. We also identified an additional $20 million of O&M and interest, and $35 million in capital reductions for total incremental cash savings of $85 million. The expected savings include reductions in labor costs and less reliance on contractor work and will be reflected in the 2019 earnings guidance, we will provide at EEI next month.","The FE Tomorrow initiative has been an outstanding effort by our teams across our corporate functions. In fact, a level of projected operating expenses associated with our shared services organization, benchmark solely within the top quartile of our industry. And we are confident that we have the proper organization and cost structure to support our fully regulated business. Past two years and this year, in particular, have been a period of rapid change in our company. I'm extremely proud of our employees' ability to remain focused on the execution of our objectives.","As you saw in the results we posted last night, our regulated businesses continue to perform very well. We reported strong third quarter results and exceeded our guidance, largely due to the hot summer weather that is lingered through the end of September. We will discuss our earnings drivers in more detail, but we were very pleased that in addition to the benefits from the heat, we saw a second consecutive quarter of growth in residential weather adjusted usage.","And at the same time, industrial usage was up 2.5% compared to the third quarter of 2017, marking the ninth quarter of growth in that class. On the regulatory front, we continue to execute on our plans. In August, we filed the first base rate case for Potomac Edison in Maryland in nearly 25 years. And this week, we supplemented the filing to update the partially forecasted test year with the full 12 months of actual data.","The $19.7 million request addresses recovery of the investments we have made in our Maryland distribution system to ensure continued, safe and reliable service. The request is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform. The Maryland Public Service Commission provided a procedural schedule that includes evidentiary hearings beginning on January 22, we expect a final order by March 23. In Ohio, our application for our $450 million distribution platform modernization plan is pending at the PUCO.","The three year plan would focus on distribution, automation, voltage control and preparing for the grid of the future. Now that the commission's powered forward initiative is complete, we believe the PUCO will be able to focus on the distribution platform, modernization proceeding and grid modernization issues. In New Jersey, our four year $400 million JCP&L Reliability Plus infrastructure investment plan is pending at the BPU.","As we discussed last quarter, this plan is designed to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of the distribution system for the benefit of our customers in New Jersey. We are hopeful that we will receive a procedural schedule soon to facilitate timely approval by the BPU. Finally, we continue to execute our energizing the future transmission plans across our footprint, and we remain on track to invest $1.1 billion in our system this year.","Consistent with our eastward expansion this initiative, this summer, we completed the $51 million East Towanda-South Troy line rebuild project in Bradford County Pennsylvania. This project was as part of our mid-Atlantic interstate transmission subsidiary, involve rebuilding an existing 19.6-mile, 115-kilovolt transmission line using 230-kilovolt construction standards. The rebuild line was designed to allow further construction of the second 230-kilovolts circuit when needed in the future. Also in May, earlier this year, we finished rebuilding a 7.2-mile section of a 115-kilovolt line on an existing right away in Bradford County and South Central Pennsylvania. This will connect to a new 10.6-mile span of line that stretches into neighboring Somerset County. When this $50 million reliability project is complete in 2019, it will connect several substations and address the risk of thermal overloads and low-voltage conditions that could impact service reliability in that region.","We've updated our full year 2018 GAAP earnings forecast to $1.68 to $2.60 per share, which reflects that deconsolidation and court-approved bankruptcy settlement with FES and FENOC and an estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments. With our strong performance and the impact of favorable weather through the first nine months of the year, we're raising and nearing our full year 2018 operating earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share from the previous range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We're also reaffirming our longer-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. Now Steve will provide a review of our strong third quarter results and our financial developments.","Steven Strah","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you today. Our results are very straightforward for this quarter. So this will be a quick discussion with plenty of time for your questions. Starting with our GAAP results, yesterday, we reported a third quarter GAAP loss of $1.02 per share. This is due to a pretax charge of $1.2 billion, representing the expected obligations under our current agreement with FES and FENOC bankruptcy cases.","And with the court's approval of that settlement, we moved the Pleasants Plant to discontinued operations to reflect its upcoming transfer to FES and excluded the plant from operating earnings starting in the third quarter. Before I move on to the discussion of operating earnings drivers, I'll remind you that we continue presenting operating earnings and projections on a fully diluted basis. This allows us to show preferred shares as fully converted and it eliminates the impact of conversion timing.","For your reference about 56% of preferred shares had been converted as of September 30. In accordance with the terms of the equity issuance, we expect the majority of the remaining preferred shares to be converted by the end of July, 2019. As always, we provide reconciliations and detailed information about the quarter and our consolidated report to the investment community, which is posted on our website.","Our third quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share surpassed the top end of our guidance with weather driving the bulk of the $0.17 per share increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. Results in our distribution business benefited by higher deliveries along with lower expenses, lower financing cost and higher regulated commodity margin. These factors more than offset related - cost related to increased vegetation management work in Pennsylvania, higher depreciation expense and general taxes.","Total distribution deliveries across all customer segments increased 6.3% compared to the third quarter of 2017. This was largely due to cooling degree days that were 28% higher than last year and 29% above normal. Sales to residential customers increased 12.9%, while commercial deliveries were up 2.7%. On a weather adjusted basis, deliveries to commercial customers were down 0.7% compared to last year. The decrease primarily reflects the continued impact of energy efficiency measures in that sector.","However, as Chuck said we continue to see positive developments in our residential customer class where third quarter weather adjusted sales increased 1.7%. This is the second consecutive quarter where we have seen a meaningful uptick in weather-adjusted residential load. Paired with the continued modest increases in our residential customer count, we are cautiously optimistic that these promising metrics will form a trend.","In the industrial sector, total deliveries increased 2.5% compared to the third quarter of 2017 for nine straight quarters of improvement over the prior year period. The increase in demand primarily came from our customers in the shale gas and steel industries, but we also saw higher usage of hospitals and universities, which was weather-related. Moving on to our transmission business, third quarter earnings increased $0.02 per share compared to last year. This reflects the higher rate base that are made in ATSI subsidiaries as well as higher revenues at JCP&L. And then our customer segment, our results reflected higher operating expenses and the impact of lower federal tax rate compared to the same period in 2017.","Finally, I want to give you a quick update on our liquidity facilities. As a fully regulated company with stable, predictable earnings and cash flow, we have a much improved risk profile that comes with lower liquidity requirements.","On October 19, we reduced aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facilities to $3.5 billion from $5 billion and extended their maturity dates to December 2022. We also entered into two new term loans totaling $1.75 billion to refinance our revolver borrowings. These credit facility changes reduced interest expense in connection with our FE Tomorrow initiative. We had an excellent quarter with strong financial result. We also achieved very important milestones in our corporate transformation, including an upgrade to investment grade by S&P.","We remain focused on execution, and we are committed to positioning FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.","Thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So maybe to just follow up here, what are the ramifications of the cost savings here? Is potential additional latitude from a balance sheet perspective? Can you talk about how you're thinking through the additional FFO to debt latitude? What kind of metrics you want to be targeting? And ultimately given perhaps the litany of opportunities, you already described on the call, where you're trending within your own Capex budget? And if you would see yourself being in a position to increase that Capex budget, whether because of the additional FFO to debt latitude or simply because you wanted to pursue external financing to raise external funds to finance some of the additional CapEx?","Charles Jones","All right. So that's like five questions in one there Julien, but I will try to take them all on. So first, FE Tomorrow, the obvious first objective was to deal with the $300 million of shared services cost, which has been supporting the competitive business throughout basically the history of our company. In a way, where none of that become a drag on our ability to execute our regulated plan, we accomplished that.","Second was to deal with the $30 million of depreciation associated with common systems that we shared with FES, we accomplished that. On top of that, then $20 million of O&M and interest and $35 million of capital, that isn't going to be substantial in terms of moving our credit metrics. It will be down in the third decimal place. So it's not going to make a big difference. Where we're targeting is 12% to 13%, which keeps us above the Moody's 12% guideline, in the S&P 9% guideline, and we expect to be there for the foreseeable future. And did I get them all?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Well, what about just the pursuing external financing? I know a few months ago, you all committed to perhaps staying away from the capital markets and living within your means if you will with respect to hitting your CapEx. But obviously, there's a lot of different opportunities than many continue to materialize here. Is there any chance that you all are looking at or would contemplate raising your CapEx budget to reflect some of these beyond the ranges that you've already articulated?","Charles Jones","Okay. So first of all, we've said, we don't contemplate any new equities through 2021, and we'll evaluate it at that point. Between now and then, we'll invest $7.5 billion in infrastructure at FirstEnergy. And at some point, equity might be unnecessary component, but not through 2021. As far as that CapEx planned today, I do not see increasing it. The plan we have generates 6% to 8% per year combined growth for our company. I don't see any reason to take it above that, and I think that's an appropriate number for FirstEnergy at this time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And if I can clarify quickly. Just with respect to the cost savings identified, '19 run rate or how do you think about that flowing into '20 onwards, right? As you think about the various pieces there, annualized and year-over-year if you will, it's more of a timing question.","Charles Jones","We'll see it in '19 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","The full year '19, to be clear?","Charles Jones","Yes.","Steven Strah","And Julien, this is Steve Strah. And I would also just say, those savings are in support and blended in within our 6% to 8% growth rate.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. But there's not an annual - annualizing factor such that perhaps that's a more of a '20 figure than a '19 figure or to the extent which that you - okay, great. I will....","Steven Strah","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Could you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the local economy and the weather normalized sales and how looks for next year to right now?","Charles Jones","Well, the good news is, we are seeing some positive developments when we adjust out the warm weather that we had this summer. 1.7% growth in the residential segment is probably the most positive. We did add 35,000 new residential customers between the third quarter of 2017 and today. So that's contributing to the growth in the past as we were adding customers. We were seeing that kind of eroded by energy efficiency and fuel switching to natural gas and other things. But I think 35,000 new customers and 1.7% growth, and it's the second quarter in a row where we've seen some growth is a good thing. 2.5% growth in the industrial sector, that's now, as I said in my opening remarks, nine quarters where we've seen growth in that sectors. So I think what we're seeing is some of the growth in the natural - national economy is starting to move into the FirstEnergy footprint.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just any thoughts on the Ohio tax reform order earlier this week, and that seems to get flexibility in addressing, any thoughts on it?","Charles Jones","Yes. I'll give you my thoughts. Obviously, tax reform is an issue we've been dealing with across the board. We're done in Pennsylvania. We're done in West Virginia. We're done in New Jersey. We'll be done in Maryland with the resolve of the rate case there. In transmission, the formula rates adjust automatically. We filed a case for the AYE stated rates to make the appropriate adjustments there as FERC requested. That only leaves Ohio left to deal with, and we have frozen rates for several more years in Ohio. But despite that, I expect, we'll be able to sit down and work with the Public Utilities Commission on some type of a settlement that makes sense for them for us and all the interested parties.","Steven Fleishman","Great. And then just lastly, I might miss this at the beginning, just at the upcoming Addison conference, the - what if any equipment or disclosures are you providing?","Charles Jones","Anything on the plate right now is 2019 guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to step back and talk about changes to the generation mix in Ohio. I guess, you have a number of moving pieces, you have numerous potential shutdowns as well as, I guess, there's a possibility of legislation that it could increase the amount of renewables in Ohio. So I'm thinking about this from an opportunity set in terms of both additional changes to the grid overtime that would be needed. If there is a number of shutdowns, possibility of a FirstEnergy directly investing in renewables, if the target renewables amount goes up. Just generally, it's a longer term, but I'd like to see some of your thinking around what that might require in terms of incremental spending, incremental changes to the grid or involvement of the renewables, anything else on Ohio that you might comment on?","Charles Jones","Right now, in Ohio, FirstEnergy is a fully regulated transmission and distribution company. We have no generation, regulated or competitive any longer, and we're focused on what it - the needs of customers are from a T&D perspective. Should there be additional closures in Ohio, there's a process within PJM to review those closures and identify any changes in the transmission networking capability to handle those. Those would be dealt with through the ARTEP process and of course we would make those changes on our transmission system as necessary. At this point in time, under Ohio law, regulatory utilities aren't allowed to invest in generations. So I'm not spending any time worrying about generation in Ohio at this point in time. We're worried about the T&D infrastructure and serving our customers the right way there.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And then just switching over to your cost cutting and making great progress there. I was curious as part of that cost-cutting effort, did you do any kind of a benchmarking, your cost structure relative to neighboring or peer utilities just in terms of how your cost structure looks? And just curious if there's any commentary could provide on pro forma, what your cost structure looks like relative to peers?","Charles Jones","Yes. We did, and we used Accenture to help us with this process, Steven. And they brought a number of benchmarks to the table to assist us, including benchmarkings of cost at a high level with our peers. But also things like, layers of management between me and the people doing the work in the corporate office, spans of control for our leadership in the corporate office. That's what drove the entire reduction. As I said in my opening remarks, now that it's all done, our corporate structure cost are in the top quartile within our industry.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And Chuck, just at the utility level, are there any of your units that are noticeably high in terms of the cost, whether it be just because of lack of scale or any other drivers? Just - I appreciated at the current level you've got in your cost down pretty massively. Just curious if sort of any of the subsidiary stand out as having a cost structure that's quite a bit higher than peers?","Charles Jones","No. In fact, there - it's just the opposite. Our utility cost structure is generally benchmarked in the top quartile and top decile for both capital and O&M, even at our current CapEx levels.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Could I just in terms of the EEI question. If not the EEI, when would be reasonable for us to expect you to think about rolling forward your current outlook, but if I'm not wrong goes through 2021?","Charles Jones","I don't think you'll see anything at EEI this year that goes beyond 2021.","Jonathan Arnold","And is that something you think, Chuck, you would do sort of with your year-end call or more sort of later in the year next year. This is going to....","Charles Jones","I think it'll be sometime later in 2019.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And if I can, what are you particularly waiting to see before adding another year to the outlook let's say?","Charles Jones","Well, there's a number of things we're waiting to see. First of all, we've got a lot of things to focus on now that we're fully regulated. I want to see whether two months make a trend in terms of load growth in our territory or not. I think, that could be a big factor. And beyond that I just think given four years out, what I like to do is give you plans that I know that we have nailed down, and we can execute on. And four years out is a little bit outside of the planning window that I think has proven for us to go to.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just on transmission, do you - any comments on the recent FERC order, I realize you have rates that have settled. As you look at the sort of potential shift to the new model. Can you just give us some context of how do you think that would set versus where you're earnings are?","Charles Jones","Well, here's how I look at it. Our formula rate - rates of return are fairly new right now. The MAIT 1 was just set recently. I think, that bodes well for those rates going forward. I think, longer term, if there's much done to change FERC ROEs, it's going to compress them with the state ROEs, and it's going to work against what FERC is trying to do to stimulate transmission investment because it's going to shift money not just in our case but probably in many other cases, down towards this recent system and away from transmission. So I think that is going to kind of be a control rod in the process. But even if they decide to move forward, here's how I think about it. 0.5% change in the ROE is about a $15 million impact on the FirstEnergy's earnings. That is not significant, and it's something we can make up within the rest of our plan and not something that will take us off track from a 6% to 8% growth rate in any way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Gordon","I think maybe we should all just email our questions to Julien and just actually ask them all. Sorry, Julien, couldn't help myself, talk to you later. So just to rebase go back and rebase the conversation around earnings. If I recall correctly, your 6% to 8% growth target is based off of a 2017, you know, $2.15 number. Is that - am I remembering correctly?","Charles Jones","The 2018 fully diluted number ex DMR.","Gregory Gordon","Right. It's a 2018 number?","Charles Jones","Yes.","Gregory Gordon","Okay, just wanted to make sure I had - that's right, 2018 number. So if I look at that then where within the guidance - that 6% to 8% guidance range or maybe you don't want to comment on this. Would you sort of feel like you were trending now that you've got the CapEx plan sort of solidified, there're cost cutting in the books, FES exiting. And if these types of load growth numbers were to be consistent, would you be confident in your ability to be sort of at the midpoint or towards the upper end of that range at this point? Or are you - is it too early for you to discuss that?","Charles Jones","So number one, I'm not going to give 2019 guidance until EEI. So that number, you'll hear in a few weeks. And beyond that, we give a 6% to 8% range. We expect to be within that range, and we don't guide right now to the bottom or the top of that range. So I think you're going to assume that we should be somewhere within that range. And a lot of factors can affect that. As I said earlier, if two months of residential growth becomes a trend that will drive more to the top end of that range. If something happens with FERC ROEs that might move us a little bit down. There's going to be puts and takes throughout that. But I'm confident and we've reaffirmed that, that 6% to 8% growth range over the next three years is something you can count on.","Gregory Gordon","Great. And you guys just paid the dividend at the same rate that you paid it since it was cut several years back.","Charles Jones","Yes.","Gregory Gordon","Can you give us some guidance as to when you think it's appropriate to go to the board to recommend a policy that's more comparable to your peers both in terms of payout ratio and growth?","Charles Jones","Yes. So we've been a fully regulated company now for all of about a month since the filing was approved.","Gregory Gordon","So what's keeping you?","Charles Jones","So I've said all along, if we expect to be treated in the market like our regulated peers at some point in time, we're going to need to have a dividend policy. In the immediate future what's keeping me is, our yield on our dividend is nothing to be ashamed of. It's in the 3.8% to 4% range depending on where the stock price is moving. We began discussions internally with the leadership team to see what we might recommend to the board, and I think just be patient, it will come, and I know we need to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","So just maybe following up on the earnings side, thinking about the DMR and the extension to the DMR. How do you see that positioned, and if that doesn't come through in terms of an extension, what kind of EPS drop-off do you see with DMR going away?","Charles Jones","So all of our earnings projections that we've given you exclude DMR. So there would be no drop-off whatsoever regardless. If we expect to file a case for extension of the DMR early next year, or hopeful that the commission will roll on it by the end of next year, and we'll have the answer about what happens with those last two years at that point in time. But it can only be positive, it cannot be negative.","Praful Mehta","Yes, I know, fair enough. And that's I guess where I was going which is, If you do get it, let's put it the other way then what is the upside that you see for the DMR going forward?","Charles Jones","Well, if you can calculate what two years of it will be worth. I wouldn't see us taking that money and doing anything with it, that would take us off track long term that we can't continue. That's why we've taken it out of the numbers that we're sharing with you now.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Fair enough. And I guess moving on to the credit side and the total debt. I was looking at Slide 31, which had your balance sheet debt and the whole core debt has gone up to about $7 billion. Just wanted to understand, is there a target of like what whole core debt you would like to have as you go through this restructuring process. I noted there was a term loan that was taken as well. So just wanted to get a little more context on the whole core debt and where do you see that going as a percentage of total debt as well.","Charles Jones","No higher than the $7 billion that it's at right now.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And is there any target in terms of what proportion it'll be of total debt going forward? Or will that only reduce as your rest of the balance sheet, I guess, grows with the growth of the utility side?","Steven Strah","Praful, this is Steve. So right now, holding company debt as a percentage of total debt will be around 35% to 40%. Over time, we expect it to go down to about 30%.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And just to clarify. On Slide 31, it says it does not include the term loans that you have recently taken. Is that not included with the $7 billion or is it within the $7 billion?","Steven Strah","So basically, our holding company debt over time will average to be about $7 billion. So it's going to be a little give-and-take, so it does include the term loans.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","I'll ask for them in orders. First of all, going back to Slide 4 on the FE Tomorrow, the $300 million of costs associated with competitive ops. Who does that actually accrued to? Meaning, does that come back and benefit FE, the new FE, the regulated FE? Does that benefit kind of FES on the way out and prep for emergence? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's happening there, and whether that's capital O&M or something else?","Charles Jones","It doesn't benefit anybody, Michael. It is the actual shared services costs that we've incurred in the past to support the FES and FENOC part of our company that have been traditionally shared with them through our shared services allocations. If we did not deal with it, it would have been a drag on our ability to execute our regulated strategy. So the goal was as FES ultimately says, we don't want these shared services anymore. We needed to make them go away. So it's basically a dollar-for-dollar elimination of the costs that were previously built to FES, so that there's no drag on our ability to move forward.","Michael Lapides","Got it. A follow-up on related question. Chuck, you talked a little bit about the yield where your stock trades, and we recognize that maybe on a valuation perspective it trades a little bit differently than some of the other kind of pure-play regulated utilities. Are there strategic thoughts you and the board are having or discussions of whether there are other changes to the corporate structure that maybe possible? Meaning, you've got a great transmission company, if you think the market doesn't value the transmission assets correctly. Are there ways to monetize parts of that or to highlight or accentuate the value of that to the market? How are you guys thinking about the kind of the value inherent within FE and the FE business family?","Charles Jones","Well, how I think about it as it's much more valuable than a lot of you think it is. Based on a 6% to 8% growth rate and a dividend on top of that. But having said that, as I said, we're about one month into now being finally a fully regulated company. And me as the CEO, being able to focus on a fully regulated company, probably 2\/3 of my focus over the first four years in this job has been on the competitive business, and what we were going to do about it, and how we were going to exit it, and the entire exit process. Now I'm able to focus on the fully regulated side of our company. A company with 6% to 8% growth isn't something that I think we want to - that we need to necessarily do anything with at this point in time. Strategically, to restructure our company, I think it's perfectly structured. We have regulated distribution utilities across five states. We've got now three investment regimes in transmission that are under formula rates, down the road, if it makes sense for the Allegheny transmission system, we move to a formula rate, we'll look at that. But it's all going to be driven about how do we maximize investment for customers and subsequent growth for shareholders out of what we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research.","Charles Fishman","I just had a quick housekeeping thing. When you initiated the 6% to 8% of the $2.15 base, you talked about shares growing to 545 million in '21. Now you're talking fully diluted 538 million in no equity. Should we just assume we're 538 million flat through 2021 for our modeling?","Steven Strah","This is Steve Strah. No, we have a DRIP program that we issue shares under each year. So it's about $75 million to $100 million of equity value. So you can do your calculation based on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Howard Scotia Weil.","Andrew Weisel","One of the topics you have been drilled into pretty deeply. So I just have a couple - more details I wanted to dig into. First, on O&Ms, just a quick one on timing, given the favorable weather this summer, were you able to accelerate some O&Ms from 2019 into 2018 that might support the guidance?","Charles Jones","No. There was none of that and in fact, because of some reliability issues, we spent a little extra O&M in one operating company, Penelec than what the original budget has. But when you get nine months into a year and you start trying to move money around within a budget, it takes people and contractors to execute what we do in this regulated business. It's a very complex maneuver. And I just want to keep the team focus on executing the plans that we have in front of them. So there was none of that done.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Fair enough. Then two questions on Capex. First of all, how would you describe the conversations with regulators, interveners around the IIP New Jersey and the DPM and potential extension of DMR in Ohio?","Charles Jones","So IIP in New Jersey, we're having discussions with both the staff and interveners. We're waiting on commission to issue a procedural schedule. I think, those discussions will go on throughout the first part of next year and will be able to give you a little more guidance on where it stands. I think, in general, the reaction to the IIP has been favorable in New Jersey. And obviously, the commission used it favorably or they never put in place. So I think that one bodes well, but it will get clarity early into next year. On the DMP, as I said, the commission in Ohio spent a lot of time on their PowerForward initiative this year now that, that's done I think they're going to have time to focus on our filing, and we're hopeful that we can get that to a conclusion. So - and on the DMR, we'll make our filing in early next year and will see where that goes. Obviously, we expect to make a case for why the last two years should be continued, but we haven't built any of that into our 6% to 8% growth.","Andrew Weisel","Okay.[indiscernible] and then if I heard you correctly [indiscernible] plan. My understanding is that [indiscernible] that anything would be incremental. So if they are approved, should we think about that?","Charles Jones","Ask the question again, your voice was garbled and maybe you get closer to your phone.","Andrew Weisel","Sorry, apologies. If I heard you correctly you said that the current Capex spend does not really have upside potential [indiscernible].","Charles Jones","I think you should think of the current CapEx plan as the CapEx plan for the next three years, and if we decide to make any changes to it beyond that, we'll let you know then. But I think you can count on it being what it is for the next three years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho.","Paul Fremont","Just a quick point of clarification I guess on PowerForward. Do they need to make determinations under that proceeding that seems to kick off in early December before they're able to actually act on your request, which looks like it would be sort of covered under the general topic that they're looking at?","Charles Jones","No. They're free to act on our request at any time.","Paul Fremont","Okay. And so you would expect then that yours will move forward independently from that proceeding? How - when would you expect the scheduling work?","Charles Jones","Paul, as I said, I think commission now has time to focus on it. We're having active discussions with the staff on it. I can't give you a date as when I expect an order, but I'm optimistic that we can get something done on it in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Jones for any final comments.","Charles Jones","Okay. Well, I'd like to thank you all for your support of FirstEnergy. We look forward to seeing you at the EEI in a few weeks. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"9518":["FirstEnergy Corp.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, Manny, and good afternoon. Welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s third quarter earnings call. First, please be reminded that during this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the business of FirstEnergy Corp. are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the consolidated report to the financial community, which was released earlier today and also available on our website under the Earnings Information link.","Today, we will be referring to operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating earnings per share by segments and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures.","Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are contained in the consolidated report. The updated fact book, as well as on the Investor Information section on our website at www.firstenergycorp.com\/ir.","Participating in today\u2019s call are Tony Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Jones, Executive Vice President and President, FirstEnergy Utilities; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I will turn the call over to Tony Alexander.","Tony Alexander","Thanks, Meghan, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, we will provide an update on the important initiatives that are shaping our company's future. Since our last earnings call in August, we have continued to build positive momentum in our regulated businesses and limit risk at our competitive operations. And at the same time, we are starting to see real progress as a result of our efforts to advocate for a competitive market that supports price stability and reliability.","I will start with the review of development across our business, including some of the early and encouraging signs of reforms in the regional competitive markets. Then Chuck will join us with an update on the distribution business and our transmission investments. Leila will then discuss the status of the rate cases at our utilities, the ATSI filing that we made last week and other regulatory matters, as well as an update on the changes we have put in place in our competitive business. Finally, Jim will review our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.","Okay. Let's get started. I'll start with a look back at events that have shaped this year so for. We believe 2014 will be remembered as a pivotal period for both our company and for the competitive environment in our region.","The stage was set with the unusually warm temperatures in our region in September 2013, which strained the regional grid. With the start of the next year the same region was impacted by the polar vortex and subsequent severe weather events throughout the winter.","These episodes of increased demand, revealed weaknesses in the regions power supply and resulted in nearly 100 emergency actions, interruptions of service to customers and severe spikes in wholesale power prices.","We reacted quickly to the deterioration in market conditions, reassessing our sales strategy and setting a new course for our competitive business, based on the new market dynamics.","As you know we took a series of significant steps, reduced our exposure to weather sensitive retail loads and to maintain a more open position to take advantage of market upside opportunities.","At the same time, we have been working to support changes that can help prevent similar or even more disastrous stress on the electric grid in the future. And it is becoming evident that the weather events are serving as a catalyst for a number of very important reforms that will not -- that we not only endorse, but view as critical to stabilizing the wholesale markets in this region.","One such reform is PJM\u2019s capacity performance proposal. This is a positive step and truly recognizing the role of baseload generation with firm fuel, the grid stability and reliability. As Leila will explain, work on this proposal is continuing, but our belief is that this could have a very positive effect on the company and the grid.","The future role of demand response also continues to be in play in PJM. The full panel of the DC Circuit recently declined to rehear the ruling that FERC does not have jurisdiction to regulate demand response in wholesale markets.","As I'm sure you all know, FERC has signaled its intent to appeal that ruling to the United States Supreme Court. Again, Leila will discuss the demand response issue. However, a favorable resolution of this issue will be positive to the company, the markets and the grid.","The increase focus around market reform issues seems to signify the start of a meaningful shift in the competitive business environment after years of very challenging conditions. We remained optimistic that this is only the beginning and we will continue to advocate for a workable solution that can ensure adequate revenues, revenues for operators of baseload generation, while also recognizing that fuel diversity and maintaining the right mix of assets are essential to reliability of our region's electric system.","Turning now to other developments across our company, starting with generation. Last week, we reached an agreement in principle to purchase the remaining lesser equity interest in the nuclear sale leaseback of Perry Unit 1 representing approximately 55 megawatts.","Consistent with our strategy to take these future obligations off the table, upon the completion of this purchase, we will have either purchased or have binding agreements for the purchase of all the ownership interest in connection with the nuclear sale leasebacks at Perry and Beaver Valley.","In August, we told you that we decided to minimize capital expenditures at our 2,400 megawatt Bruce Mansfield plant, while we evaluate the strength of competitive markets. Although, the results from the September 2016, 2017 incremental auction were stronger, Mansfield did not clear.","While we continued to operate and maintain the plant, we will consider the impact of the market reforms currently being considered, as well as the results of the May 2015 PJM auction for the 2018, \u201919 period in our decision about the timing of the dewatering facility. That is required to continue the plants operation after December 31, 2016.","As we look towards colder weather, we believe our baseload coal-fired and nuclear units are well prepared to meet the demands of this winter. These units have on-site fuel supplies that are not generally affected by extreme weather. And thus play a critical role in providing reliable and affordable electricity to the grid year-round.","During the summer and fall months, we also performed a series of maintenance activities to prepare our baseload generating stations to meet the demands of the winter. We have set up heating elements that provide additional warmth to piping, added antifreeze to some equipment, installed storm barriers to protect from winter weather, provided temporary heaters in areas most susceptible to cold and increase fuel supplies at our coal-fired facilities.","In addition, we will stay in close contact with PJM throughout the winter to avoid scheduling plant maintenance during periods of expected high electricity use. This work should help prepare our fleet for potential demand spikes this winter.","Leila will provide an update on other initiatives within our competitive energy services segment, as well as introduce 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the business later in the call. With respect to our distribution business, we are very engaged on the regulatory front. We just reached the settlement in our West Virginia rate case and have several other active rate filings as well as all our fourth ESP in Ohio, all of which are moving through the regulatory process.","We expect outcomes in all of these cases by May of next year. As these proceedings are completed, we will be able to provide much more transparency with respect to our expectations in the distribution business and the timely recovery of our investments going forward. In our transmission business, we continue to make excellent progress with our Energizing the Future initiative which Chuck will describe in more detail.","We also filed with FERC last week to change the structure of ATSI\u2019s formula rate. The proposed change requests moving from an historic test year to a forward-looking test year, which will provide a better match of our cost as we continue our investments in this initiative. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.89 per share, in line with our expectations.","We also reaffirmed our 2014 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 and $2.60 per share. Jim will provide more detail on that guidance as the mix of operating earnings among our reporting segments has changed slightly. At EEI conference next week, we plan to share more detailed information about the 2015 drivers in our regulated businesses and better frame future opportunities in our transmission business.","Looking ahead, we will provide additional updates as we begin to get more clarity around other external drivers, such as ATSI filing and any further developments in the competitive markets than once we begin to receive result from a rate cases likely in the springtime frame. We\u2019ll be able to provide not only full 2015 guidance but significantly more detail and greater clarity into the financial and operational expectations across the company.","It has been a busy and productive period and we are on track with a solid plan to build and strengthen our company. We have put into play critical elements that are needed to provide long-term value and stable predictable growth. We remain committed to driving change, both within the company and in our industry to better position FirstEnergy for the future. Thank you for your support.","And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck Jones for an update on our regulated businesses. Chuck.","Chuck Jones","Thanks, Tony. I'm pleased to join the call today. I'll start with a brief look at our distribution business and then move to an update on our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program. We remain encouraged by the steady growth and stable load in the commercial and industrial sectors of our distribution business, both of which continue to benefit from the modest economic recovery and increased economic investment primarily related to shale gas.","While weather was significantly mild compared to the third quarter of 2013, our distribution business continued to produce solid results. More important, as you have heard over the past several earnings calls, the overall trends for commercial and industrial deliveries remain very solid. In fact, adjusted for weather, we have now seen five consecutive quarters of growth in both the commercial and industrial segments.","The industrial pipeline remains promising. Among this region's traditional industrial base, including steel, automotive, electrical equipment and petroleum sectors nearly all of our key customers are expanding and clearly shale related activity remains a bright spot.","Signs point to continued and accelerated growth in this sector. In addition to its considerable impact on our distribution business, the shale industry is also driving growth in our transmission segment. Approximately $250 million of the regulated transmission investments we have identified for 2015 at TrAILCo are designed to meet rising electric demand, driven by the shale gas industry across our regulated service territories.","This infrastructure, including high-voltage substations and transmission line is coming online to accommodate new shale gas processing facilities pipeline compressor stations and other energy intensive operations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. These midstream projects alone account for 1100 megawatt of anticipated electric load growth in 2015 through 2020.","The rapid growth in the shale gas industry is transforming communities and creating new jobs and economic opportunities throughout our service territory. The investments we're making in transmission infrastructure will benefit customers throughout the Marcellus and Utica shale regions by boosting electric service reliability across the system.","New electric infrastructure will directly support the build out of the shale gas industry and the resulting economic activity across the region. By upgrading our local power infrastructure, we can help communities attract other energy intensive industries while ensuring the highest levels of service reliability for every electric customer.","But the shale industry is just one driver of the $4.2 billion in investment opportunities we are planning from 2014 through 2017 across our transmission footprint. In 2014, we are on track to complete $1.3 billion in investments, expanding 1100 projects this year. This year's initiatives include approximately 100 projects associated with generating plant deactivations, which we have discussed in the past.","We continue to make steady progress with projects designed to enhance service reliability for our customers. For example, in Toledo, Ohio, we are constructing a new 48 mile 345,000 volt transmission line using existing transmission towers and building a new substation. This $32 million project which is on track for completion by June of 2015 is designed to enhance service reliability in our Toledo Edison Service area and to accommodate future electric load growth.","In our Mon Power service territory, we are on track to complete a large expansion project this year that will support the electric demands of the areas rapidly expanding Marcellus Shale Gas industry, including 280 megawatts of incremental load that is expected to come on line in December.","The $50 million project includes installation of the new substation, with state-of-the-art voltage support as well as sectionalizing equipment on an existing 41-mile, 138,000-volt transmission line, will enhanced service reliability for Mon Power customers along the Route 50 corridor in Doddridge, Harrison and Ritchie counties. These are just two examples of the hundreds of projects that are already completed or underway.","We expect the transmission business to be our primary growth platform, not only through the previously announced $4.2 billion investments through 2017, but as we continue to implement our \u201cEnergizing the Future\u201d initiative for many years thereafter. In fact, only $1.6 billion of the initial $7 billion \u201cEnergizing the Future\u201d investments is being undertaken in this period. The vast majority of the current estimate is for RTEP projects related to generating plant shutdowns and to meet the increasing demands within the service area. We will layout additional details regarding future transmission investment opportunities at EEI next week.","Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Leila.","Leila Vespoli","Thanks, Chuck and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a brief update on our competitive business and then I will look at the status of our distribution rate cases and other regulatory matters.","The transformation of our competitive business is well underway. As we announced in August, we are pursuing the effective hedging of the majority of our generation resources with reduced risk and at the highest margins possible, while leaving a portion of our generation available to capture market opportunities.","The actions we have taken put our competitive business in a stable position, from which we can gauge market conditions and participate when and where the opportunities are most promising. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to allow attrition of our MCI and mass market customer base as contract terms expire, as well as weather sensitive LCI loads.","Overall, contracts sales volume decreased by 4.5 million megawatt hours, compared to the third quarter 2013. At the same time, we are maintaining targeted sales levels to government aggregation customers in Ohio and participating in POLR auctions where we see value.","During the past month, POLR auctions were conducted in both Pennsylvania and Ohio that will ultimately determine retail generation service rates for these small service customers. Both auctions produced results that appear to reflect an increased risk premium, which we believe is associated with volatility and uncertainty in PJM.","In Pennsylvania, the auctions were for 12 months and 24 months, residential and commercial products for delivery beginning June 1, 2015. Auction clearing prices for residential products range from between $70.09 to $85.15 per megawatt hour, while clearing prices for commercial products range from between $74.46 to $89.65 per megawatt hour. HPS won nine tranches in that auction.","In Ohio, HPS won four tranches in the 10th wholesale auction, which produced an average clearing price of $73.82 per megawatt hours. These results will be blended with previous auctions and one upcoming auction in January 2015, to establish retail generation rates from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016.","For 2015, our committed sales are about 59-kilowatt hours. After 2016, committed sales are at 33 kilowatt hours, reflecting the currently committed sales growth of LCI, MCI and mass market, as well as the POLR and government aggregation sales. We remain on track to transition to a target portfolio of retail sales in LCI and government aggregation, as well as POLR sales in the range of 10 to 45 kilowatt hours annually.","Let\u2019s look now at financial expectations. For 2015, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the Competitive Energy Services segment of $900 million to $1 billion. Given the slight increase in market prices versus mid-July, we are comfortably in the upper end of that range at this time.","Last quarter, we told you that we expect our competitive business to be cash flow positive of the period 2015 through 2018 and we continue to support that expectation. This conservative forecast does not take into account the numerous uplift opportunities such as incremental auctions, the removal of demand response and other possible catalysts. We will revise our outlook if needed, as these issues are resolved.","Today, we are introducing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 in the range of $850 million to $950 million. The reduction compared to 2015 is driven primarily by seven-month of high capacity prices in 2015 versus five months in 2016, and the amount of generation that clear 2015, \u201916 auction versus the \u201916, \u201817 auction.","The 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance estimate also includes an additional 500 megawatts of capacity that cleared in the incremental auction for the 2016-17, PJM planning year held in September. That leaves about 2,700 megawatts still available to participate in the July incremental auction for the \u201916, \u201917 periods.","I will note that adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are providing for both 2015 and 2016 does not reflect any of the changes that are being considered in the capacity markets or any estimates of future incremental auctions applicable to those periods. All of which could provide significant uplift, as the value of baseload generation is recognized in the market. We have put together in place a solid strategy to position our competitive business going forward. And I believe we are in a sound position to take advantage of market upsides.","Let\u2019s shift now to a review of regulatory development. As Tony mentioned, PJM recently provided in more detail around his capacity performance proposals. Key elements of the proposal include classified supply resources into two groups -- capacity performance resources and base resources.","Liming the amount of base capacity resources, that will be procured in the base residual auction, allowing units to satisfy the capacity performance criteria to offer into the RPM auction as the net cost of new entry and imposing significant penalties in the event of non-performance during peak usage periods. We do have some concerns around PJM\u2019s proposals.","Last week, as a member of a coalition representing more than 69,000 megawatt of installed capacity in PJM, we advised PJM that three important changes should be made in the capacity performance proposal. First, a multi-year pricing mechanism that limits year-to-year price declines to not more than 5% should be incorporated into the proposal.","Second, price cap for the transitional auctions should be increased to the net cost of new entry. And third, the proposed penalty structure should be reformed so that the potential penalties are better balanced with the financial opportunities for participating as a capacity performance unit. We will continue close engagement on PJM\u2019s proposal and will participate fully in the stakeholder and thought proceedings that are unfolding through the end of the year.","Another key issue is the proper role of demand response in PJM markets. As Tony mentioned, the DC Circuit recently rejected a request for rehearing ruling that PJM does not have jurisdiction to regulate demand response by means of wholesale energy market rules and tariffs.","At FERC\u2019s request, the Court has stayed the enforcement of its order until December 16 of 2014 and then pending FERC\u2019s potential request that the US Supreme Court accept an appeal of the Circuit Court's ruling.","In light of possible outcomes from the decision, a PJM white paper recently proposed to move demand response from the supply side to the load side. However, because the proposal still would permit demand response to participate in price formation in the capacity markets, including potentially to set the market clearing price, we believe that the proposal is legally unsupportable. We have communicated our concerns with this approach to PJM and expect to continue this dialogue with PJM and affected stakeholders.","Finally, on September 22, 2014, we filed our amended complaint regarding participation of demand response in the May 2014 base residual and obviously more rule develop on our complaint with order 745 proceedings progress.","Let\u2019s now move to our assay formula rate filing at FERC. As Tony said, this filing, which was made on October 31st, proposes to change the structure of the ATSI formula rate. The proposed change requests moving from historic test year for transmission rates reflect actual cost from the prior calendar year to a forward-looking test year which would reflect the estimated cost for project expected to be in-service within the current calendar year, with an annual true-up which would allow for real-time recovery of cost. We have requested that new rates be effective on January 1.","Turning now to review of state initiative. In Ohio, our fourth ESP called Powering Ohio's Progress, which was filed in August, is before the PUCO. In addition to building on the success of our current ESP, the plan includes the proposed economic stability program, which involved a 15-year purchase power agreement between our Ohio utilities and SEF, which will help ensure the continued operation of more than 3,200 megawatts of vital baseload generation while benefiting our customers by mitigating market volatility and rising retail prices.","Hearings are scheduled for January with the decision requested by April 8, 2015. We continue working with customers, employees and officials on the state to advocate for this plan, which we believe is very good for Ohio and for our customers.","Let\u2019s turn now to New Jersey where the Board of Public Utilities approved an Administrative Law Judge request for 45-day extension to render an initial decision in our base rate case. The ALJ\u2019s initial decision is expected to be filed by November 13. The BPU also issued a favorable decision in the generic proceeding reviewing its policy regarding the use of a consolidated tax adjustment and base rate cases.","The Board stated that it would continue to apply its CTA policy and base rate cases subject to the following modifications proposed by the BPU staff. Calculate savings using a five-year look back from the beginning of the test year, allocate savings with 75% retained by the company and 25% allocated to rate payers and exclude transmission assets of electric distribution companies in the savings calculation.","As it relates to our pending rate case, the order provides for the BPU following the initial decision of the ALJ to reopen the record for the limited purpose of adding a CTA calculation reflecting this modified policy. Although we are still reviewing the CTA order, by our interpretation and calculation we expect the CTA revenue adjustment to be reduced from approximately $56 million under the earlier policy to approximately $5 million to $6 million.","In Pennsylvania, evidentiary hearings in the base rate proceeding of our four operating companies are scheduled for January 13 through 16, 2015 with the final order expected in May.","And finally, in the Mon Power and Potomac Edison rate case yesterday we filed a settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, which is subject to their approval. The agreement includes a base rate increase of $15 million to help address operating costs at our power stations and our distribution business. It also moves the costs associated with the Harrison asset swap into base rate and eliminates the recovery of those costs through the temporary transaction surcharge. It also includes a vegetation management surcharge of approximately $48 million, recovery of nearly $46 million and cost associated with major storms of 2012 and increased billing assistance for low income customers.","Parties to the settlement agreement include the PSC staff, the Consumer Advocate Division, the West Virginia Energy Users Group and Walmart. We're very satisfied with the settlement and believe it will provide us with the resources necessary to help ensure continued safe and reliable electric generation and service for our customers with reasonable returns for our business. Pending approval by the PSC the rate increases would go into effect on February 25, 2015.","Thank you for your time. We are pleased with our progress to position the competitive business for future success and to assure a successful regulatory environment for our regulated businesses.","Now let\u2019s turn the call over to Jim for a review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.","Jim Pearson","Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report, which was issued this morning and is available on our website.","As Tony mentioned earlier, our third quarter operating earnings were $0.89 per sh0are in line with our expectations. Third quarter 2013 operating earnings were $0.94 per share.","On a GAAP basis 2014 third quarter earnings were $0.79 per basic share compared to $0.52 per basic share in the third quarter of 2013. A list of the special items that make up the $0.10 difference between our GAAP and operating earnings can be found on page 2 of the consolidated report.","Now let\u2019s review the key drivers of operating earnings across each of our business segments. We will begin with our distribution business where we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.56 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the third quarter of 2013.","Moderate weather was the most significant factor this quarter with lower distribution deliveries impacting earnings by $0.03 per share. With respect to the other drivers in the distribution business pension expense, depreciation, and interest expenses all increased slightly in the quarter. However, these factors were offset by earnings related to the Harrison\/Pleasants asset transfer and a lower effective income tax rate.","Looking more closely at the affects of weather on third quarter results, cooling degree days were 15% below last year and 17% below normal, which led to a 1.5% decrease in total distribution deliveries. Most of this impact can be seen in the residential sales, which decreased 784,000 megawatt hours or about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2013.","In the commercial sector, third quarter distribution deliveries to commercial customers decreased by 199,000 megawatt hours or 2% due to the moderate weather. We can get a better picture of the sales trends by looking at the 12-month weather adjusted average for the period ending September 30.","Over that time frame residential sales are basically flat compared to the same period a year earlier while commercial sales are up nearly 2%. Finally industrial deliveries, which do not have a strong correlation with weather, increased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by continued strength in most of our key industries, including steel, shale, refinery, electric manufacturing and chemical.","The industrial sales trend over the 12-month period through September 30th also reflects a 3% increase. As Chuck mentioned, we're very encouraged by the continued strength of the commercial and industrial sectors in our region. And we remain optimistic that we are seeing signs of an authentic turnaround in the economy after the sharp declines that began in 2007 followed by long period of stagnation.","Let\u2019s look now at our transmission business. Third quarter operating earnings were $0.13 per share, unchanged from the third quarter of 2013. Drivers in the quarter included higher transmission revenues as a result of the revenue requirement increases associated with ATSIs annual rate filing and higher capitalized financing costs related to our 'Energizing the Future' investment program. These were offset by higher vegetation management expenses and increased interest expense.","In our competitive business, third quarter operating earnings were $0.25 per share, compared to $0.24 per share in the third quarter 2013. Operating earnings benefited from lower operating and maintenance costs, a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by lower commodity margin and lower capitalized financing cost.","Commodity margin decreased operating earnings by $0.04 per share due primarily to lower contract sales volume and higher capacity expense partially offset by higher PJM capacity revenues.","Additionally, while higher capacity rates resulted in higher contract sales prices, overall unit prices had a negative impact compared to the third quarter of 2013. As we mentioned in the past, this can be traced back to the significant decline in market power prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2011, when we held a larger open position for 2014 relative to 2013.","Consistent with our strategy to reposition our sales portfolio, our overall retail customer account is now approximately 2.3 million, a decrease of about 400,000 compared to the third quarter of 2013. At the same time, total channel sales decreased 4.5 million megawatt hours or 16%.","This decline is intentional, as we focus on effectively hedging our generation and eliminating weather sensitive low. Sales to governmental aggregation customers decreased 14% due to lower sales and eliminate an Ohio driven by pure customers and lower usage due to milder whether.","Total generating output at our ongoing units increased 802,000 megawatt hours driven by fewer outrages at both our super critical coal units and nuclear fleet compared to third quarter of 2013. A strong generating output along with lower contract and wholesale sales resulted significantly lower purchase power costs.","Commodity margin also benefited from higher capacity revenues and lower MISO and PJM transmission costs, while higher net financial sales and purchases, which are used to hedge our exposure to market pricing congestion volatility reduced market. The lower commodity margin was more than offset by a decrease in O&M resulting from lower retail and marketing-related expenses and decreased plant costs.","Finally, I'd like to review the benefits we're seeing this year related to the effective tax rate. On a consolidated basis the effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.1% compared to 34.1% in the same period of 2013, resulting in an increase in consolidated earnings of $0.02 per share.","The 2014 effective tax rate benefited from an IRS-approved adjustment that increased the tax bases in certain assets allowing for increased tax deductions. This was partially offset by higher tax valuation allowances. On a year-to-date basis consolidated effective tax rate is 32.4% compared to 36.2% for the same period in 2013.","We continue to focus on managing our tax obligations through various federal and state planning initiatives and currently estimate our effective tax rate to be 30% to 31% for the year, primarily reflecting additional benefits in the fourth quarter resulting from the resolution of a state tax position. Our 2013 effective tax rate was 36.2% and we anticipate our tax rate going forward to be between 36% to 38%.","Before we move on to review of financing activity, I'd like to take a moment to review our 2014 operating earnings guidance. As Tony mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and at the same time making adjustments among the segments. I\u2019ll walk you through these changes which are outlined on slide 154, the fact book that was posted to our website today.","First; in our distribution business, the impact of mild temperatures lower than the forecasted residential usage and increased non-deferred storm expenses bring that segment\u2019s operating earnings to a new midpoint of a $1.93 per share for the year.","We also see improvement in our competitive business from lower operating costs bringing the midpoint up $0.03 to $0.20 per share, an improvement in our corporate segment, reflecting the favorable tax rate increases the midpoint $0.05 to a negative $0.17 per share and regulated transmission remains unchanged with the midpoint of $0.54 per share.","Finally, we continue to fund our transmission expansion program during the quarter through the issuance of $400 million of 30-year senior notes at ATSI in September. Also during the quarter, we re-marketed $241 million of pollution control revenue bonds at FirstEnergy generation and First Energy nuclear generation. We remain pleased with the strong overall performance of our transmission and distribution businesses during the third quarter and first nine months of the year.","We have a solid plan in place across our company to drive results and we're committing to creating value for investors. Now I'll open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Hey. Good afternoon guys.","Tony Alexander","","Hello Dan.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Hey. There was huge matter of information. Thank you for all that. I guess, looking at the PPA or the ESP process in Ohio, something that\u2019s come up and raised is the idea of the off-market transaction for 15 years in those assets. Can you just kind of walk through, maybe a little more of the legal justification for beyond the obvious benefits to Ohio customers or the visibility?","Leila Vespoli","Hi, Dan. This is Leila. So obviously and proposing this, my legal team was very mindful of the legal precedence that was out there. I think from a policy perspective, we put forward a very wonderful case that we address that and then, I will go into more of the legal specifics. If you think about these plans, especially Ohio plans build and service Ohio customers, Ohio jobs, Ohio tax saves",".","So from a standpoint of, whether this is something that is beneficial certainly from an economic standpoint is very beneficial. Having this generation, as we justified on our filing also, over the 15-year period would provide essentially $2 million worth of benefits to customer, so acting like an insurance policy. From a legal perspective, if you think about the aggregate rule, Ohio is a competitive state. So we do not have captive customers. So FERC has waived the rule, it applied to us.","Also, we were very mindful of two of the other cases up there, being the -- hit the (indiscernible) case and the Hanna case. And have put in place mechanisms within the case, so that we do not run or fall of the particular things in those cases that triggered FERC\u2019s finding that they were legally informed. So, offline, we can go into the details. But, again, the legal team is very mindful of that in the structure of the PPA proposal and what the commission can and can\u2019t do and the terms and conditions actually associated with the PPA.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. And I guess on the West Virginia settlement, the element that I haven\u2019t gone through all of it, given the earnings day today. But the Harrison plant probating contributed as much or any on this that we\u2019d expected on the first transfer. Would this settlement help get the full value of that rate base uplift into earnings going forward?","Leila Vespoli","So, essentially, what this case did, so let me back up for a second so. In the Harrison transaction, we stipulated that case. In that agreement, we agreed to file this base rate case and so this is the case where we basically flipped what would have been surcharged into base rate. So, essentially, all we did is take what we\u2019ve covered in that revenue stream and flip it to base rate treatment.","And then on top of that, the stipulation provides for an additional $15 million increase. And in addition to that, roughly $48 million of our vegetation management surcharged, which should help with our distribution and reliability which is good in West Virginia but should help enhance that as we go forward. The stipulation also provides for establishment of regulatory assets associated with mass investments in 2016 and \u201917, and other different provisions from the company's perspective, which we believe is very good. Again, this is a case that we filed as a result of a stipulation and I think -- prior stipulation and I think from a company standpoint, our customers\u2019 standpoint is a very good result.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. And just one last question just on the quarter. With this lower demand with the weather and all that, how much benefit did you guys see out of the retail business despite reduced volatilities, is that kind of what helped on some of the earnings gap this quarter?","Donny Schneider","","Dan, this is Donny. In the main, what we saw obviously, there wasn\u2019t a volatility issue that we faced in the first quarter. But we took advantage of a lot of the O&M savings. We\u2019ve reduced the workforce and that sort of things, so that's really what flowed through for us in the quarter.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I guess my first question is, if I look at capacity performance and the potential hatter, how should we think of that relative to your PPA proposal in Ohio? Would you potentially rethink the offer in Ohio?","Leila Vespoli","Hi Paul. This is Leila. So we made our filing and we are going to go full with our filing. I think, having the potential for capacity performance proposal by PJM and if it gets eventually approved by FERC, will be even a more enhancement for Ohio customers. But we would not withdraw our ESP commitment. I think overall the proposal by PJM is a positive development. But as I noted, I think there are ways that it could be improved.","I think that they should consider with performance persistent pricing mechanism. If you think about it in terms of the generation, the need for revenue and kind of the longer-term horizon, if it were to have a mechanism whereby year-to-year, the downside were kept by 5% generators, where we could get a better sense of what the capacitive pricing might be from year-to-year that would definitely be a positive development.","In the transitional years, we think it should be uncapped up to net cone, given that the markets, I think everybody\u2019s account have not produced the revenues that most agreed that they should have. We think that that would be a more appropriate place getting revenue to generators, so they can make the investment in their plans to increase reliability and a better balancing of the penalty structure. I think PJM approved upon it but we still think the penalty structure is a little bit more draconian than it should be at this point in time.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","And when, Jim when you ran through corporate another, I guess corporate another is already benefiting this year from tax, from lower tax what should we think of -- in terms of corporate and other as sort of a better indication for a run rate?","Jim Pearson","Okay, Paul. I\u2019d said earlier our effective tax rate would be anywhere between 30% to 31% this year and its going to most likely move back up to the 36% to 38% of our range next year. So that that would be probably about $0.25 a share, Paul, and most of that flows through corporate another.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","So a $0.25 per share increase off of the 17, right?","Jim Pearson","That\u2019s correct. No, not all of that will go to corporate but most of that would.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Okay. And in terms of the nuclear leases. The last nuclear leases if I recall you bought them in the range of like $1500 per KW. Can you -- what type of a price did you pay for the most recent lease purchases?","Jim Pearson","We haven\u2019t disclosed that yet Paul. The transaction hasn\u2019t completed yet. I can say I would say both parties are very comfortable with the price we paid. So that\u2019s something we are ready to disclose at this point.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","And the last question in West Virginia, was it a black box settlement or was there some agree to level of ROA?","Leila Vespoli","So the parties agreed to the $15 million increase in the other terms. The commission actually asked that we -- in our filing how we got to that. So you will see us part of the settlement. If you go to the exhibits, each of the parties will lay out how it got there. The company has not laid out the ROE associated with it. But there is an ROR number.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Good morning. Sorry, good afternoon guys.","Tony Alexander","Hi. Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Just a quick question on as we look at these adjusted EBITDA outlooks for the competitive business, am I right that this is a delta between the commodity margin and the EBITDA number is mainly O&M consistent -- and probably general taxes consistent with the earnings statement?","Chuck Jones","That will be correct Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So I guess my question is when you look at the 15 to 16 numbers the implied expense number goes down about $100 million between 15 and 16. And if you look at the run rate on 14, its down quite a bit more than that 15 or 14. So can you just talk about how we think the components that bridges that as those numbers just seem quite big?","Donny Schneider","Jonathan, this is Donny. Yeah I think if you take a look at the EBITDA from 15, if you\u2019re trying do come up a walk from 15 to 16. In \u201915, we\u2019ve got a midpoint of $950 million. And then if you look at what the capacity revenue does from \u201815 to \u201816, it comes down about $225 million\u2026","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Yeah but\u2026","Donny Schneider","And then we have improved margins about a dollar megawatt hour so that\u2019s a positive about $80 million. And then other O&M and cost reductions, that\u2019s about $100 million, gets you right to about $900 million for midpoint.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That was already my question, is there a $100 million of O&M saving embedded in that forecast, it sounds like the answers is yes.","Donny Schneider","Yes. That\u2019s throughout and we have one last nuclear outage in the \u201816 timeframe and that especially helps.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Can you also bridge so that we\u2019re in a $1.5 billion of non-GAAP O&M in a year-to-date through September and it\u2019s been running about $400 million at least last quarter. So how does it got from that number down to the $1.250 billion or so implied in the \u201815 guidance? What are the big drivers there? I\u2019m looking at the delta between\u2026 ","Jim Pearson","Jon, it\u2019s one or two have high rates, take it get back because there\u2019s probably a lot of components to make that up, so I shall get back to you after the call.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Happy to do that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon.","Leila Vespoli","Hello.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to explore the capacity performance penalty side of the equation and Leila, you touch briefly on it. Just curious if the ultimate roll ends up quite similar to the proposed penalty rule that PJM has laid out. Would that as you assess kind of the risk reward of your fleet? Do you think that would likely lead you to think about some degree of asset shutdowns, not at all or how do you generally think about that the risk of penalties?","Leila Vespoli","So the penalty structure again, I think was mitigated from their prior proposal. But you can\u2019t look at it in isolation, you have to look at the other moving pieces in parts. Right now, the coalition noted in their comments that right now if you had a single 12-hour too bleak, it could cause you to lose the equivalent of 71 days of revenue. So there are both kind of things you need to look at and have a trade-off.","If the pricing mechanism will raise in that color and you\u2019re able to recover that level. You might be able to think a little more positively about that kind of penalty. So again, there are a lot of moving pieces in parts and I wouldn\u2019t look at the penalty just in isolation.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Understood. And then just thinking also about carbon regulation and how the different states might look at that, I was particularly interested in Pennsylvania and Ohio, is it your sense that there is some probability to those states who think about joining the regional carbon mechanism such as regi, do you think the states are more likely to resist the proposed regulations? What\u2019s your general sense of those two states and how they are thinking about carbon?","Tony Alexander","Stephen, this is Tony. I think at this point it\u2019s a little too early to tell. I still think that each states evaluating and trying to understanding and comprehend the proposed rule and as well as trying to figure out whether or not the alternatives to them moving from to a mass kind of calculation would be easier for them to manage.","So, I think, at this point, everybody is trying to understand what\u2019s going on, not clear where they are going to end up yet. And my senses is that until we better understand how this rules going to be applied in the options, it will be hard for any one of the states to otherwise indicate exactly which way they are intending to go.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital","Thank you very much. I have two questions. One is, so I\u2019m clear in the guidance of 2016 the generation capacity that didn\u2019t fear in either the original or incremental auction is assumed not to receive any capacity revenues?","Tony Alexander","That\u2019s correct, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital","Okay. And then second, I hope I misheard that one is, okay. So there is a change in the effective tax rate between \u201814 and \u201915, and what is the $0.25 of a swing? Is -- are you suggesting that the parent level drag increases from $0.17 to like $0.40? Jim?","Jim Pearson","Yes. That\u2019s right, Angie. That will be the range.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital","Okay. But why is -- I mean, what was then the effective tax rate in \u201913 when we have about $0.27 or $0.26 drag?","Jim Pearson","I think the effective tax rate in \u201913 was about 36%.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital","Okay. So it\u2019s a same type of rate that you\u2019re guiding for \u201915 and beyond. So why such a big delta?","Jim Pearson","We have some additional debt outstanding and we have some of that debt had variable rates, so those rates could increase on that also Angie. So it\u2019s primarily associated with additional interest costs.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Staub","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more call.","Operator","Certainly, the next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Tony Alexander","Yes, Paul. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","All right. There is some -- on slide 161 of the investor handbook. There is a large pension and OPEB cash flow item of $750 million to $550 million. And I was wondering that wasn\u2019t their last time and I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s the driver in that and why is there a cash benefit associated with that?","Jim Pearson","Paul, this is Jim. What that slides referring to is that we looked at the discount rate at the end of the third quarter, which we traditionally do and we say what would be change to our GAAP earnings be, if that discount rate remain in effect till December 31.","So what that\u2019s representing is a discount rate that goes from 5% down to a range of either 4.25% to 4.5%. That also takes into account a change in the mortality tables where the liability increases by 4%. So that\u2019s not a cash flow benefit, its just a change in the liability of our pension plan that we would have to report the impact to GAAP if the discount rates stays where it is today.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. So, I mean, so in the sense, reconciliation of net income GAAP to FFO, this is a non-cash reversal.","Jim Pearson","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","So, I guess, okay. I\u2019ll have to follow up offline, I guess. And the deferred taxes in ITC that went down by about $190 million, anything in particular there?","Jon Taylor","This is Jon. This is primarily just utilization of some of our NOLs that are making up the difference. So that\u2019s primarily the largest driver.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","I mean, just two back on the CES EBITDA, there seems to be an other income decrease on slide 136 and I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s the driver there in 2016?","Jon Taylor","That\u2019s primarily lower earnings from some of the investments we have. We have an equity interest in a couple of different investments and we\u2019re seeing lower earnings in that period, so that\u2019s going to drive that down.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Jim Pearson","Okay. Thanks everybody. Thanks for joining us today. If you didn\u2019t have a chance to ask your questions, please contact our IR Department. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Annual EEI Financial Conference in Dallas.","As you heard today, we\u2019re making solid progress on the initiatives that the designed to deliver predictable and sustainable growth at our regulated distribution and transmission businesses. And you will hear more at EEI of our future transmission investment opportunity.","In our competitive business, we\u2019re implementing a sound strategy to reduce risk, while positioning the business for the future. At the same time, we continue to strongly advocate for market reforms that can better support much needed price stability and service reliability and we\u2019re pleased to see growing momentum in support of these changes.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, miss. You may begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, and good afternoon.

Thank you for joining us. With our 2000 earnings forecast being of great interest to many of you, we thought it would be best to start today's call with the financial discussion, then Tony will follow with closing comments on the company and the economy.","Before I move to the third quarter review, I'd like to talk briefly about Hurricane Sandy, the most devastating storm in our country's history and its impact on 2.3 million customers in the communities across our entire service territory, no doubt including some of you who may be on the call. Outages related to the hurricane were fully restored in Ohio and Pennsylvania earlier this week, and we are working to complete restoration in our New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland service territories as quickly and safely as possible. There may be isolated pockets of New Jersey customers located in inaccessible areas or who have individual flooding or down-line issues that will take longer. Yesterday's nor'easter created an additional 120,000 new outages in the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy, and we brought in 1,600 additional crews today to assist with restoration. In addition to nearly 1,000 -- excuse me, 11,000 of our own employees, hurricane restoration has been assisted by almost 9,000 outside crews that were available to us as a result of our membership in 4 mutual assistance organizations: Mid-Atlantic Mutual Assistance, The New York Mutual Assistance Group, Southeastern Electric Exchange and Great Lakes Mutual Assistance. Tony will talk more about the hurricane and its impact in a few minutes.","Let's get started with a review of the quarter. Today, we were pleased to report solid third quarter earnings results that are very much consistent with our expectations, including continued growth in retail. Excluding special items, non-GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2012 are $1.11 per share, compared to $1.39 per share in the same period of last year. On a GAAP basis, third quarter 2012 earnings were $1.02 per share, compared to $1.27 per share in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date 2012 non-GAAP earnings are $2.53 per share and GAAP earnings are $2.20 per share. We are narrowing our 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is the lower end of our previous range. Although we continue to successfully manage our costs and improve retail margins, these efforts have not been able to offset the impacts from the weak economy, which continues to languish much longer than expected, or the weaker sales generally and mild weather this year.","As we discuss third quarter drivers, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community, which was posted on our website this morning. Special items are detailed on Page 5 of the report. These 5 items have a net impact of decreasing third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings by $0.09 per share. Special items for the third quarter of 2012 include a $0.02 per share decrease related to tax legislative changes, a $0.03 per share decrease related to merger accounting for commodity contracts, a $0.03 per share decrease from regulatory charges and a charge of $0.04 per share associated with plant deactivation costs. These reductions were partially offset by a $0.03 per share gain from mark-to-market adjustments.","As a note, we have normalized the revenues and expenses related to the older coal-fired units that we designated for deactivation as a result of environmental regulations. The Reliability Must-Run units are not being normalized after September 1, 2012. These units are receiving RMR payments from PJM that effectively makes their operating earnings neutral.","Now let me move to the main drivers for the third quarter, starting with the positives. The first of these is lower operating costs, which include lower expense associated with ongoing fossil operations; the transfer from expense to capital of utility project costs relating to the alignment of Allegheny's work management system with the FirstEnergy system; and lower energy delivery expenses, primarily due to more devoted -- more work devoted to capital projects in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same period last year, as well as lower overall non-deferred storm costs across all service territories this year versus last.","Earnings also benefited from lower interest expense as a result of recent financing activities, lower depreciation expense due to a reduction in depreciation rates for West Penn Power and lower general taxes primarily due to lower gross receipts.","With respect to the negative drivers for the third quarter, they include a higher effective income tax rate, lower distribution deliveries and reduced commodity margin.","Distribution deliveries decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2011 as overall deliveries decreased 1.7 million megawatt hours or 4%. Commercial deliveries were down 3%. And for the first time in several quarters, we also saw a decrease in industrial deliveries. While there was some growth in the chemical and refinery sectors, industrial deliveries were down 5% overall compared to the third quarter of 2011 as a result of lower steel and automotive production.","Finally, residential deliveries decreased by 4% in the quarter. Some of the year-over-year decline in residential consumption can be attributable to weather. Despite the hot summer in much of our service territory early in the quarter, third quarter temperatures were actually about 4% milder on the whole than in 2011.","Let's move now to a review of commodity margin, which is detailed on Pages 2 and 3 of the consolidated report. In that report, you'll also find additional information on megawatt hour volumes. Overall, commodity margin had a negative impact of $0.34 per share. As you know, this includes the absence of the $0.18 per share benefit realized in the third quarter of 2011 related to fuel contract restructuring. It also includes a $0.22 per share impact from lower PJM, RPM capacity revenues, which is primarily a result of lower capacity prices that became effective this past June. Excluding those 2 items, third quarter commodity margin increased earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the third quarter of 2011, driven by a 10% increase in competitive contract sales volume. These gains in contract sales once again partially offset energy prices. While overall prices were down about -- down by about $3 per megawatt hour, the net impact to our sales was only about $1 per megawatt hour after adjusting out the impact of lower capacity prices.","Looking more closely at third quarter competitive contract sales, we achieved a 9% increase in direct sales driven by growth in Central and Southern Ohio; mass market sales more than doubled, driven primarily by growth in Pennsylvania and in Ohio; a 47% increase in structured sales; a 15% increase in government aggregation sales. In the past year, we have signed on 43 new communities in Ohio and 81 new communities in Illinois. This week's selection governmental aggregation was approved in about 200 Illinois communities and we will be actively participating in the process to make offer to those potential new customers.","And finally, consistent with our retail strategy to realign our sales portfolio, solar sales continue to decrease. Commodity margin also benefited from lower congestion, network and transmission line loss expense, net financial sales and purchases and lower fuel expense primarily due to a 3.4 million megawatt hour decrease in generation output from our competitive fleet compared to the third quarter of 2011. This reflects the change in our economic dispatch strategy, a nuclear outage and the plant deactivations that occurred on September 1.","Purchased power increased by $0.40 per share due to decreased generation volume and the increased retail sales I just mentioned.","Finally, wholesale sales volume had an $0.08 per share negative impact on the quarter results. This also reflects the 21% decline in prices at the 80 Hub from $43 to $33 year-over-year. As I\u2019ve said before, our retail strategy partially mitigates the impact of the prices established in the wholesale market.","We remain very pleased with the overall performance of FirstEnergy Solutions. We've achieved a 42% increase in the number of retail customers compared to the same period in 2011, and we look to end 2012 with 101 million megawatt hours in competitive sales. We believe our retail strategy has 2 primary competitive advantages: First, we are building our retail book to look like a utility in a regulated market, using a generating portfolio that was originally built for that kind of load. The difference today is that we can optimize our channel mix because we are not constrained by the old geographic barriers. Second, we now have more than 2.5 million retail customers, which gives us a much larger customer base or denominator to spread back-office costs. We believe that these 2 advantages results in pricing flexibility that sets us apart even in a depressed power market. We believe this is why FirstEnergy Solutions has been so successful in the market.","Now moving away from 2012 to a more detailed discussion of our 2013 non-GAAP earnings guidance, which is $2.85 to $3.15 per share. A high-level overview of the 2013 non-GAAP earnings drivers, sales forecast and generation forecast can be found on Page 22 of our consolidated report.","In 2013, our regulated utilities are projected to deliver solid earnings of $2.08 to $2.13 per share, and our transmission segment is expected to earn between $0.47 and $0.52 per share. The earnings from our regulated operations are in line with our prior guidance. As we have said in the past, these 2 segments, combined, provide a solid foundation with stable earnings, cash and strong support for our dividend. Corporate and other is expected to reduce 2000 earnings by $0.25 per share. Our competitive operations are expected to provide between $0.55 and $0.75 per share in 2013.","Total sales volumes to direct retail customers or those in the LCI, MCI, governmental aggregation and mass market channels are expected to grow by 12% year-over-year while POLR and structured sales are expected to be down 6% compared to 2012, again consistent with our strategy to shift away from POLR.","Our competitive sales volume forecast for 2013 has been revised to 104 million megawatt hours, and we anticipate an average rate per megawatt hour of $53. At this point, our 2013 sales are already 81% committed. We are providing a range for competitive generation output next year of 78 million to 93 million megawatt hours. We are giving a range because it provides the flexibility to respond to market conditions as we continue to leverage our fuel and dispatch strategies accordingly.","I'm sure you have questions on the drivers for 2013, some of which we can answer today. But I also want to note that we will be posting materials for the EEI Financial Conference to our website this Sunday afternoon. Those materials will include additional information in advance of the conference where we look forward to seeing many of you.","One final note before turning it over to Tony. I wanted to also brief you on a project that we're very excited about. We've entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with American Municipal Power or AMP to develop 873 megawatts of peaking capacity at our Eastlake plant located in the ATSI footprint and just east of Cleveland, Ohio. This project is subject to, among other things, regulatory approval. Under the MOU, we would supervise construction of the units. AMP would provide 100% of the construction financing and own 75%. Upon completion, FirstEnergy will purchase the remaining 25%. Importantly, FirstEnergy Generation will manage the project and operate the units.","At this juncture, we anticipate the facility would be operational in early 2016 and would be bid into the 2016-2017 PJM-RPM auction scheduled for next May. This proposed project is expected to reduce our need for some of the previously announced transmission projects and extend the timeframe for others. As a result, our earlier estimates for transmission spending of between $700 million to $900 million for 2016 have been reduced by about $200 million, bringing the estimated transmission spend to $500 million to $700 million. Approximately $150 million of that will be incurred in 2013. We are very pleased with this project and its potential benefit to FirstEnergy.","As we move forward, we will continue to assess our operations and look for additional opportunities to reduce our costs. Most importantly, we remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by expanded competitive markets and improved economic conditions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony J. Alexander","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a brief update on some recent events, and then I'll provide my perspective on the economy and the actions we are taking to strengthen the company as we continue to address the challenges of low market prices and weak demand for electricity.","First, we know many of you experienced, firsthand, the devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy. The wind, flooding and snow associated with the storm ultimately resulted in power outages for about 1\/3 of the utility customers we serve across our entire service area. The storm, which was far more destructive than Hurricane Irene and last year's unusual October snowstorm, has required replacement of more than 7,000 poles, 24,000 crossarms, 3,000 transformers and nearly 600 miles of wire and cable. Storm costs are expected to be in excess of $500 million and approximately 95% of that is expected to be capitalized or deferred for future recovery. Final storm costs will be determined during the fourth quarter.","We called upon every available resource to restore service to our customers as quickly as possible. Our own employees from across our 10 operating companies were joined by thousands of contractors and mutual assistant crews from other utilities all across the United States. Together, they worked under difficult conditions to clear debris and make repairs at thousands of locations throughout our service area. I'd like to extend a special thanks to the elected officials, police, fire and emergency management personnel for their dedicated efforts in keeping public safety a priority and helping us meet the unprecedented challenges of this disastrous storm. We understand that losing power is a significant hardship, and we greatly appreciate our customers' patience and understanding as we continue to complete this massive restoration effort.","Let's move now to a review of regulatory activity. In Ohio, a 3-year auction for generation supply for our Ohio utility customers was conducted on October 23 and resulted in a price of $60.89 per megawatt hour. FirstEnergy Solutions participated and won 5 of the 17 tranches available for bid. The next auction is scheduled for January 2013.","Also in Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission approved our application to securitize previously incurred costs that are currently being recovered from customers under deferred recovery riders. As filed in the application, those riders were estimated at $436 million as of December 31, 2012. This was the first test of the state's new securitization law. We expect to file an application for rehearing on November 9 to obtain certain changes and clarifications to the PUCO order. Once the rehearing process is successfully resolved, we expect to use the proceeds from the transaction to reduce debt at our Ohio utility companies.","Finally, in August, the PUCO ruled on AEP's modified electric security plan. And in mid-October, the PUCO upheld many provisions of its July order in the AEP Ohio capacity case. In addition, Dayton Power & Light filed an electric security plan in October. We continue to believe that giving customers the right to shop will result in lower electric bills in an improved Ohio business climate. FirstEnergy Solutions will continue to monitor and actively participate in these cases and remain a strong advocate for competitive markets.","Turning now to new regulatory activity. Leila Vespoli and her team will be focused on 2 new proceedings over the next year or so. In New Jersey, we will file a rate case with the Board of Public Utilities by December 1. The filing was delayed from the originally scheduled filing date of November 1 due to the devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy on New Jersey.","In West Virginia, we plan to file with the Public Service Commission for approval to transfer ownership of the Harrison plant to our Mon Power Subsidiary. West Virginia is our only fully regulated service territory and we deactivated about 600 megawatts of regulated generating capacity there earlier this year due to the new environmental regulations. This transfer is part of a resource plan to address the capacity shortfall and ensure reliable power for Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia. Under the terms of the proposed asset transfer, Mon Power would acquire an additional 80% of the Harrison plant, giving the utility sole ownership of the 1,984 megawatt facility. In addition, Mon Power would sell its 8% minority interest or 100 megawatts in the Pleasants Power Station to Allegheny Energy Supply. We considered a number of alternatives to obtain the necessary energy and capacity in West Virginia, including purchasing power from the market or building new generation. We believe this proposed asset transfer is the most cost-effective option for our customers and our company over time. And since the facility is equipped with modern emission controls and produces electricity with locally mined coal, the plan should be very positive for the economy of West Virginia. The proposed asset transfer will require approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","Moving now to an update on some of our marketing efforts. Our retail strategy focuses on optimizing our channel mix. And as you heard earlier, we expect to grow our direct retail sales by 12% in 2013. As a part of this effort, in late August, FirstEnergy Solutions launched a major new mass market campaign featuring a 7-year fixed price offer. This innovative product targets residential and small commercial customers in the Southern Ohio markets, as well as in our Ohio utility footprint. We are extending the offer and also plan to introduce similar fixed price offers in other states, consistent with our strategy of seeking higher-margin channels while continuing to offer innovative products to customers. This program, along with others, will help shape our retail portfolio, consistent with our overall strategy. We remain focused on building our retail business and strengthening our brand among customers in targeted markets. We believe this retail strategy, as well as the actions we're taking across the rest of our business, will position FirstEnergy to take advantage of improving economic conditions over time.","Now with respect to the economy, we certainly anticipated that it would be more robust when we developed our initial forecast for 2012 and 2013. Instead, we continue to see very slow, even stagnant growth. The impact on our company, and in fact, our industry is essentially flat electric distribution sales with no growth in the residential sector, decreasing demand from many small and medium-sized commercial customers and very spotty growth in many sectors of the industrial customer class. This weak sales environment is coupled with depressed power and natural gas prices over the past year or so, which has put downward pressure on earnings from our competitive segment. With a significant oversupply of generation and weak demand continuing to dominate in our region, we expect these conditions to continue in the near term. Longer term, in 2015 and beyond, coal plant deactivations as a result of MATS and other environmental regulations should improve the power supply and demand imbalance that we have today.","In response to these ongoing conditions, we took a step back and reframed our projections and some of our short-term strategies. We accelerated our normal budgeting process in order to share our 2013 outlook with you today. And we completed a thorough assessment of how we operate our facilities, taking the steps necessary to continue reducing costs and aggressively managing our expenses. As a part of that process, we completed an organizational study that resulted in the reduction of approximately 200 positions in our corporate support departments and at FirstEnergy Solutions. In addition, we anticipate the reduction of another 300 to 400 positions throughout 2013 due to normal attrition throughout our operations. We also implemented changes to the 401(k), health care and other employee and retiree benefits.","We will continue to assess our operations, our regulatory opportunities and financial initiatives to ensure that we continue to deliver value and remain positioned to take advantage of growth when the economy does eventually recover. And as we pursue additional cost savings, we remain focused on ensuring we have a strong balance sheet given our increased capital program over the next several years. We have a strong management team, and we are prepared to meet these challenges in order to deliver shareholder value.","As we look to the future, we see several catalysts for longer-term growth. First is the overall improvement in the general economic conditions over time should bring us back to at least modest levels of growth at the regulated utilities, and we see the potential for exciting additional growth opportunities associated with the Marcellus and Utica Shale build-out within our service area. Transmission investments within the FirstEnergy footprint will provide growth and stable returns. The current supply-demand imbalance will likely tighten as additional generating facilities in the region are deactivated due to more stringent environmental regulations. And improvements in the price of natural gas and power will benefit our fleet.","Finally, I know there's been a lot of talk recently about dividends. That's where I would like to close. While it's always subject to board approval, we expect to maintain a stable and solid dividend. As the numbers earlier reflected, our regulated operations provide a strong foundation of earnings, cash and support for the dividend. And I am committed to our efforts at maintaining a stable and secure dividend.","Thank you for your continued support of FirstEnergy. And now, I would like to open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tony, when you think about all the process you guys went through in the last couple of months to reevaluate 2013 and really much of that inquiry of yours have been on the FES side. What is set out to you is kind of the biggest surprises, both positive and negative, to get to guidance where we are right now and if there's anything in there that you see as a bright spot or a negative spot amongst those bands, what do you think they are right now?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, if you take a look at the entire company and the bright spot in my mind, quite frankly, is the resourcefulness of company management and executives to take on problems like we have in the challenges of this current economic condition and come to a positions that allows this company to move forward, to position itself for the future, to be able to take advantage of improving conditions going forward and to deliver in the near term fairly solid results, given the circumstances in the market that we are currently facing.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tony, when you look at the O&M savings and kind of the ability to bring down headcount, of the decline in O&M in the winds of inflation, how much of that is going to be people-related? And if you think about looking to a recovery, can you support a recovery at this new base or will there be some greater acceleration in costs as the recovery takes off?","Anthony J. Alexander","No, I think I'm pretty comfortable, Dan, with the headcount and numbers that we have in place at this point. We said it looks like about 200 positions have been eliminated. We expect another 300 to 500 next year through kind of normal attrition through the organization. We should be able to hold headcount steady. As the business grows, we'll evaluate the need for additional resources wherever those resources may be needed.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one last one. Just on kind of on the channels for customer positioning. I know you gave the 2013 numbers and you don't want to get into a '14 guidance situation. But if you were to look at trends, where do you think you're going to see more growth amongst those customer classes looking at kind of some of the market developments we've had recently?","Mark Tanner Clark","This is Mark. I think it\u2019s just as easy for Donny to answer, but we're really targeting the mass market and the middle commercial industrial market. We think those are very fertile for us. We like the stability offered to us by the large commercial industrial market. We said we're going to target less POLR. So you should see growth in both the MCI and mass market, and Donny's group is being very aggressive in those markets and targeting them and coming out with new programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just thinking through your 2013 guidance and the projected output of the power plants of 78 to 93 terawatt hours. And I'm just sort of thinking through in 2013 and beyond your sort of net long versus short position on power price changes and was wondering if you could give some guidance as to if the forward power price were to change, how that would impact you in 2013?","Donald R. Schneider","Stephen, this is Donny. Rather than think about it from a power plant output perspective, I would draw your attention to our open book. Right now, I think Mark said we're about 81% closed, leaving about 19% of our book open for '13. So obviously, as prices move that -- those sales would reflect increased prices.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. What I was trying to think through is the balance of the retail book that's about 81% hedged versus the power plant open position and trying to figure out sort of on a net basis whether you're sort of evenly matched or if a change in just change power prices would have a sort of net bottom line impact to EPS in 2013?","Mark Tanner Clark","I guess all else being equal, any increase in the power price would have a positive impact on the bottom line. If you're getting to would we run more of our own plants if, in fact, the power prices went up? Yes, we probably would. Right now, we're keeping some of them down because we can buy it less expensive that we can produce it. Donny's also renegotiating a number of the fuel contracts. That'll have an impact next year depending on his success, and he's had great success so far, so higher power prices would in all likelihood mean more production from our side and -- but don't forget that, that also impacts what we can do on the coal contract side.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then you had mentioned ATSI and some work you're doing there. As you think about whether that zone may remain constrained or not, does some of your recent activity there sort of change thinking, or how do you generally think about whether that zone could be constrained?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, I don't think adding the generation there is really going to change the dynamics because PJM will make a decision based on the amount of new -- either new transmission or hard generating assets within that area to determine the extent of and where constraints may be and how they would attempt to address them. I still like -- like we've talked in the past, I still like the idea of having generation inside the City of Cleveland and I'm very pleased that we are able to work this arrangement out with AMP. I think it's a solid plan, and I look forward to proceeding with that and getting that deal put through all of the hurdles to make it -- to get started on it.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And lastly, if I may, just very briefly. On pension assumptions for 2013, anything you would highlight in terms of assumptions that you've made in terms of any material changes in terms of things like discount rates or anything else we should be thinking about as we think about your pension expense?","Mark Tanner Clark","I don't think we've made any changes, but we're no different than anybody else watching the treasuries for what that impact could have on the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Couple of questions. I guess, first, the -- is there -- have you assumed the West Virginia transaction gets done in the guidance for '13 and is that meaningful within the range of numbers you're giving?","Mark Tanner Clark","I think the answer to that would be yes and it's in the guidance, but I don't know if I'd characterize it as meaningful.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then on the mass market offers that you've had, could you maybe give us a little more color on what kind of take-up you've had for that offer? What kind of consumer reaction you've had?","Anthony J. Alexander","It's been very positive.","Mark Tanner Clark","Now that's a little bit like the margin question. We prefer not to deal with what individual margins are per channel and we prefer not to talk about the successes in the volumes we were having with respect to individual programs. But we've been very, very pleased with it; that's why we extended it past the October 31 date.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, when you gave the guidance a couple of years ago, in your channels there used to be a wholesale channel. I'm assuming now that your generation is so much lower that you're really not going to be selling anything wholesale. Is that the reason that's no longer showing up there?","Donald R. Schneider","Steve, it's -- a big piece of it is just when you look at forward prices in the wholesale space coupled with where we're at with generation. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to forecast much wholesale sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question on retail. You've talked about expanding retail here. Just kind of curious on a go-forward basis '13 and perhaps beyond, matching up your load and you generation. I mean, is that an ambition here, obviously gas prices being as volatile as they are, or are they kind of being somewhat structurally separated here from a certain perspective?","Mark Tanner Clark","I don't think they're being structurally separated. I think -- we want to have that retail book look more like a regulated utility and so that would be about 1\/3 industrial, 1\/3 commercial and 1\/3 residential. That's why we're pushing a little bit harder on the mass market residential, the medium commercial, which is kind of the lower end of commercial. We might pull a little bit out of the LCI downward into those channels and we'll be trying to do less on the POLR side. So it ultimately should be pretty close to 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 and that's what we're targeting, but that's what our generation was built for as well, so...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And so maybe perhaps not to put words in your mouth, when you think about like '14 and beyond, is your thought process to keep your retail intact to 100 terawatt hours and over time see generation kind of leg back up into that level. Is that kind of the thought process?","Mark Tanner Clark","Well, I think we've said in the past that retail will lead generation. As the retail side grows, we may add generation. We may go secure some other sources, but retail will lead the generation portion. In other words, we want to have the sale before we commit on the other side.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, right. Absolutely. And speaking of the other side of the equation, could you perhaps describe a little bit more of the economics of the new peaking plant that you described? I mean, I suppose the primary question I would have is didn't this clear in the last auction, the last ATSI capacity auction, that is, and are you benefiting from those kinds of economics or how are you getting paid for this?","Mark Tanner Clark","Well, first, we're not funding the construction of it, so we were really looking at the market in '16 and '17 of which we plan on bidding into, but it did not clear when we proposed it to PJM. But my understanding from AMP is that they don't -- they're indifferent to that and they're going to build it no matter what. They have their own requirements. They self-serve and we're just happy to do this. We're going to build it; we're going to operate it. It helps the reliability issue. It drives down some of our transmission expense. And we're going to own 25% of it at the tail end. So it's kind of a win-win for us and a win-win for them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then just a last quick question here. In looking at the details on your '13 guidance, RPM revenues seemed to have come down from what you guided at your last analyst day. In terms of the year-on-year decline, it looked like it's less. You kind of described $200 million. Now it's closer to that $160 million level from what I can tell?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, Julien, this is Donny. We don't always clear 100% of our available capacity in those BRA auctions. And so when you think about the numbers we give, those are based on the BRA auctions. Subsequent to that, we will always participate in incremental auctions, and on occasion we'll do a bilateral contract for capacity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. So implicitly, what you're saying is you've locked in more capacity contracts in the interim, right?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","I was just -- Mark, I don't know if I am front-running the Sunday slides or I don't know if you can help me just trying to get a broader sense. The previous guidance midpoint was around like, if I'm right, $3.30 or so and we are now at $3 so there's a decrement of about nearly like $0.30 -- $0.30, $0.35.","Mark Tanner Clark","It's actually $0.25.","Ashar Khan","$0.25.","Mark Tanner Clark","Right, $3.10 to $3.40 was the prior guidance. Now, it's $2.85 to $3.15.","Ashar Khan","Now if I take the revenues numbers and if I'm throwing the wholesale piece out as Steve has mentioned, but if I just take the revenue that you had previously from the channel sales and which you're giving right now, the decrement is something like $0.80 or so. If I just do the -- decrease the revenues, I'm just doing it like that. And you've mentioned O&M, you pick up $0.15; Mansfield leases, you pick up $0.05, probably another $0.05 on this lower revenues and all that. So I'm left with like trying to account for another $0.40 of improvements to offset that increase in channel revenues. And I don't know if you can help me where those improvements are coming from because you mentioned the regulated business is similar to what it was before and there's been no change over there. Can you just help me where those other $0.40 of improvements are coming from, generally?","Mark Tanner Clark","Well, I don't know if you're front-running or not, but I can tell you that Tony alluded to the fact that we're taking 200 positions out in the corporate and the FES side. Those are effective December 1. So those will not be in next year. We expect 300 to 400 to 500 people to attrit. They will not be in next year's numbers either, so -- and we changed some of the benefit programs, some of the other things around. Those are big numbers. They're well in excess of $100 million, just the things I had alluded to right there. I'd have to go through the whole list of all the changes, but it's pretty much across-the-board. I think Tony said it really, really well when he challenged all of us to go find money. And even though Chuck might be a midpoint of $2.60, which was the midpoint we had him before, there's a little bit of a mix in that. Distribution is up a little bit, transmission is down a little. So even though his numbers might be the same as to a midpoint, they're a little different. And I would say that, there's just a whole host of smallish-type things that added up to a big number. When you take -- after you factor out the volume and the price delta that we already alluded to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Earlier this morning, PPL actually pointed auto as a bright spot in Kentucky. Can you given a little more flavor about what's going on with steel and auto?","Mark Tanner Clark","Well, I can't give a description of Kentucky, but I know, for example, the Chevy Cruze, which is produced in Youngstown, had a record month last year in terms of sales of 34,000 vehicles. So I think some of it is just a little bit of catch-up. We were going for a while at double-digit year-over-year increases in industrial sales and then we kind of slowed up to the high single digits. So some of it, I think, is just catching up. But again, the Cruze is still running 3 shifts, but I don't believe they're running 3 shifts through the weekend. Ford backed off a shift, but they're still running 2 shifts instead of 3. Steel input -- steel output is strong and that's really, really tied anymore to what's going on in Marcellus and Utica. So it could be just a plant-specific quirk or it could be an industry quirk, but we're really pleased with the plants that we have in our territory because they're all running 2 or 3 shifts.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And if you look at the midpoint of guidance at $3, kind of what underlies that with respect to your expectations economically? Is that just status quo?","Mark Tanner Clark","We didn't do anything in terms of -- if you're asking did we get overly aggressive with the economy to bump the numbers up; no. In fact, I think we held them pretty consistently flat across-the-board.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Chin of Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For Hurricane Sandy, how much of that $0.5 billion cost comes from Jersey Central versus in Monongahela?","Mark Tanner Clark","I don't have the numbers right in front of me, Brian, but I would say the vast, vast majority, probably 80% or higher.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Comes from Jersey Central.","Mark Tanner Clark","Right.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I know that you guys have done historically a very good job in terms of recovering storm costs, but when I look at sort of the magnitude of the cost estimates here relative to the amount of outages, it seems like Hurricane Sandy is just a lot higher in order of magnitude of costs. Can you just talk about what was it in particular that made Hurricane Sandy a lot more expensive than, say, Irene or the October storm?","Mark Tanner Clark","Tony flew over in a helicopter so I'll let him talk to that. But I spoke to Chuck Jones, the Head of Utilities this morning and he's been around for 35-some years and he's -- he just continues to say he's never seen anything like this before. But Tony flew over it, so I'll let him speak.","Anthony J. Alexander","I think, Brian, the extent of the damage is extensive and broad, affecting -- when you think about it, it affected almost every customer we have in New Jersey in terms of we had over 1 million customers out. We had to build back the system with not only some transmission, but substation and sub-transmission, substation damage that had to be corrected. And the amount of trees in and across multiple power lines. It's just the way the storm hit, the way it came through New Jersey, hit our service territory and several other companies because they're struggling with many of the same issues that we are, very hard. And you can tell that with the restoration effort the way it is, I mean we're probably restoring at this rate faster than any other restoration any place in the country with this amount of extensive damage. But it's still a very slow go hooking up customers with the amount of damage that's been sustained. I mean it's significant; it's broader than what we've seen before and it's affecting many more circuits multiple -- in multiple places than what we've seen in the past.","Mark Tanner Clark","Brian, I'd just give you one quick example. I mean, if you have a substation that's flooded, you have to wait until it drains out. But in this case, you might have a substation that's flooded with saltwater, which means you not only have to wait for it to drain out, but then you have to re-flush it out so you get the salt off all the circuits, so it's like almost you're getting penalized twice. Once, to have to wait for it to drain out then you've got to deal with the salt that's all over. So it's like this compounding effect.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And then my last question on this, so obviously the JCP&L rate case has been delayed in terms of their filing until December. When you make the December filing, is Hurricane Sandy cost recovery going to be a part of that or is that going to be handled in a separate proceeding?","Leila L. Vespoli","Brian, this is Leila, yes, I would expect that filing to take into account the effects of Hurricane Sandy. We're still working through exactly how we would present that, but we would anticipate including it in the filing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Brian just asked one of my questions so I'm not going to ask that again. But on this issue of the capacity delta in 2013, the $160 million versus the $210 million before, you said it was due to having not placed all your capacity in the initial BRA auctions. Was there any element of that line that relates to having entered into some more term contracts where that's kind of part of the retail margin, or would that show up at a different line? I guess, that's my question.","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, Jonathan, this is Donny. The -- if you're thinking about when we doing retail sale, take our 7-year product as an example, obviously that spans well into the '15, '16 BRA and beyond for that matter. And so there is a component of capacity revenue as you levelize that charge that you pull forward, but that would actually show up in our retail sales.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So what you're showing in that line is just the pure wholesale capacity PJM auction-type piece?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, that's correct.","Operator","The last question is from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So New Jersey in the last 14 months or so has had 3 major storms that have caused extensive damage and extended outages for large numbers of customers. Now this last one cost your company something like $400 million in storm restoration cost. Is the industry thinking ahead to a need to harden distribution systems in a significant way to prevent the recurrence of these costs or is that something that's certainly not kind of become an issue for discussion yet?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't think generally that, that's been proposed. I mean, a lot of talk has been out about we should underground everything. The costs of doing that are pretty extensive and have significant impacts on individual customers and their neighborhoods as you begin to bore through the underground facilities. No one likes these types of storms, obviously, and to the extent that there are things that we can do over time to make the system a little more resilient, we'll be undertaking them. Obviously, after 3 storms, I'd be surprised if there's a tree left standing, but there certainly are more there that I expect that we had problems with last night as a result of the nor'easter coming through. So it is a combination of whatever system you have in our space. Essentially, 95-or-more percent of what we do is exposed on a day-to-day basis to the elements. Whether they are wind, whether it's flooding, whether it's surges off the coast, hurricanes, snowstorms, all of them have impacts that need to be taken into account. To the extent that there are other things that we can do over time, we're certainly going to look at them. But when a major storm like this comes through, whether it's in New Jersey or anyplace else, it has significant consequences.","Mark Tanner Clark","We look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference, which gets underway in just a few days. In terms of logistics, we plan to post additional materials on our -- of our 2013 guidance along with EEI materials to our website sometime midafternoon on Sunday.

Alexander","Thank you, Meghan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today's call with a look at our first quarter results, then I will discuss some of the recent developments in each of our businesses, and I'll finish with an update on our full year outlook. Leila will provide a more in-depth review of our competitive business, as well as an update on regulatory activity. And Jim will present more details on our first quarter financial results.","Okay, let's get started. This morning, we announced first quarter 2014 operating earnings of $0.39 per share, in line with the range we provided on our year-end call in February. Even though the extremely challenging weather continued throughout the quarter for our competitive business, we had good results overall in both our distribution and transmission businesses. In fact, our distribution business not only delivered strong performance during the quarter, but even more important, we continued to see positive trends in both residential and commercial sales, as well as growth in the industrial sector.","Adjusting for the impact of weather, total distribution sales increased 2% compared to the first quarter of 2013. This includes an increase of nearly 3% on a weather-adjusted basis in the commercial sector. We are obviously pleased to see consecutive quarters of sales growth in the commercial sector. Weather-adjusted residential deliveries increased more than 2% compared to the first quarter of 2013, and we saw modest growth in our customer count, continuing the positive trend we noted during the fourth quarter. Sales to industrial customers increased about 1% compared to the first quarter of 2013, driven by manufacturing segments related to shale gas in our region, as well as continued steady growth from the automotive sector.","We also welcomed the announcement in March of a planned ethanol cracker plant in our Mon Power service territory. While this project is still in its early stages, the land has been purchased, and we remain optimistic that our region is prime for a cracker plant. This development would be a tremendous boost to not only the shale gas industry in our region, but related manufacturing sectors across our service areas.","Our first quarter distribution results, together with the growing momentum in the shale gas industry, sustained our cautious optimism that a more substantial recovery is on the horizon for both the commercial and industrial sectors. We are on track to meet or exceed our growth forecast for all 3 sectors this year.","On the regulatory front, we filed our rate case in West Virginia last week, and we expect to file an ESP in Ohio and rate cases in Pennsylvania -- in our Pennsylvania service areas later this year. We are also looking forward to resolution of our New Jersey storm recovery and base rate cases. Leila will provide more details on each of these cases later today.","Finally, in our transmission business, we are moving forward with our planned investments to support continued service, system reliability and enhance service to our customers. Projects underway include construction of our 100-mile transmission line from our Bruce Mansfield Plant to a new substation in the Cleveland area. This project is being constructed primarily to support the generation deactivations in the ATSI footprint. In addition, we are well underway on many of the smaller projects that are part of our transmission improvement program. While we did lose some physical construction time this winter due to the weather, we still expect to meet our targets for the year.","Now turning to our competitive operations. While Leila and Jim will provide more detail about the specific impact the extreme winter weather and, more importantly, market conditions had on our competitive business, I'll take a moment to discuss what this winter's instability says about the state of our region's electric infrastructure. As you know, the regional grid was under severe stress during the polar vortex in early January and other frigid weather events in the remainder of the quarter. The combination of several factors, including high customer demand, forced outages and plant unavailability, in particular those driven by gas shortages, illuminated the fact that current energy priorities are putting the reliability of our electric system in jeopardy and creating a far more volatile energy price and service environment for customers.","This is of particular importance in competitive states, where customer service and pricing are very much dependent, if not solely dependent, on stable and predictable wholesale markets. As you may know, we've shared this view in our testimony at FERC, in comments to business leaders and legislators and in media, and we will continue to advocate for regulatory changes that can ensure generating resources are valued at a level that reflects their contribution to grid reliability. While some modest reforms dealing with overreliance on imports and demand response have been approved by the FERC for the upcoming PJM capacity auction in May, we believe momentum is growing for changes that can truly help maintain the reliability, service quality and price stability that have long been enjoyed from our electric system.","Even so, we are evaluating our target level of retail sales, including the markets and channels in which we concentrate our efforts and our hedge position, given the significant volatility now within the wholesale energy markets, the ever-changing market rules and, as we approach mid-2015 and beyond, the anticipated shutdowns of generation within the market. It has always been a part of our overall strategy to maximize the performance of our competitive business. As we evaluate and refine our targets in light of current market conditions, we are in a good position, since we only have about 55% of our generation committed for the 2015, 2016 PJM planning year and about 33% committed for the 2016, 2017 planning year. This gives us substantial flexibility as we consider how best to position our competitive business going forward.","With respect to our plant performance during the quarter, even though our overall fleet performed better than expected -- in fact, we delivered more capacity to PJM than our units were committed to deliver or were being paid for -- we had several nuclear and fossil outages and derates that occurred during the most volatile pricing periods. And as Leila will explain, these outages, given the high prices for energy during those periods, had a significant impact on our results.","During the quarter, we also successfully replaced the Unit 1 main transformer during the forced outage at Beaver Valley plant in January and commenced the Davis-Besse steam generator replacement project during a planned refueling outage. Davis-Besse is now in the startup process, but the outage took 15-or-so days longer than expected, which we estimate will result in about a $0.02 impact for the second quarter. In April, we also began the scheduled refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2. The outage is on track, and we expect that unit back online during May. We have no other refueling outages scheduled this year.","This morning, we revised our 2014 operating earnings guidance to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. It was a tough quarter for our competitive operations, given the market dynamics in PJM, and we have adjusted the earnings range at that segment to reflect the quarter's results and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our corporate segment and regulated utilities are expected to come in better than our original estimates, and our transmission segment is roughly in line with original expectations. While this is a very difficult quarter, we continue to believe that our distribution, transmission and competitive businesses provide a solid platform to deliver value to our investors, and we appreciate your support.","Now I'll turn this over to Leila for a regulatory and power markets update.","Leila L. Vespoli","Thanks, Tony. Given the significance of the extreme weather and market conditions on our competitive business, I will begin with a discussion of the first quarter impact and then move to a regulatory update.","First, extreme weather conditions resulted in customer usage that was about 6% higher than normal during the first quarter. We typically hedge for normal weather, leaving open a small portion of our expected customer load as we enter each month. Increased sales are covered through market purchases, from our peaking generation or a combination of both. This quarter, higher market purchases, reflecting weather and, to a lesser extent, our small open position of less than 3%, decreased earnings by $0.10 per share net of increased sales revenues. Higher prices exasperated the earnings impact of our power purchases. Average prices during the first quarter 2014 were nearly $68 per megawatt-hour or double the 3-year average of about $34 per megawatt-hour.","More importantly, however, prices during the most volatile days, the 10 highest-priced days during the quarter, where the average around-the-clock day-ahead price at 80 Hub was between $150 and $500 per megawatt-hour, were what really impacted the quarter's results at our competitive segment. All 10 of these volatile days coincided with untimely outages at some of our units, including Beaver Valley and Mansfield. And we couldn't procure natural gas for our West Lorain peaking plant, which would have helped offset some of that impact. The combination of these events, net of fuel costs and better-than-expected generation at other units, resulted in increased power purchase expense of $0.23 per share. The impact of the 10 days was $0.13 of the $0.23.","Ancillary expenses from PJM were also up significantly as a result of January charges that were about 10x higher than normal and that exceeded the charges for the entire calendar year 2013. While we anticipated significant ancillary charges when we spoke to you in February, PJM added a March true-up bill of roughly $0.02 per share, reflecting their decision to socialize these costs across the entire region. Our total share of these expenses amounted to $0.10 per share, while the net effect on earnings was $0.05 per share, reflecting a passthrough of some of these costs to industrial and commercial customers, as well as our decision not to seek reimbursement for about $0.02 in expenses from residential customers.","Looking at other drivers. Higher capacity prices drove a $0.07 per share increase in capacity expense. And finally, the deactivation of Hatfield and Mitchell, along with the transfer of Harrison and the hydro unit, improved earnings $0.04 per share, taking into consideration lower fuel, operation, depreciation and interest expense and increased purchase power to replace that generation.","As Tony said, we continue our work to encourage consistent and reasonable market rules that help rather than hinder competitive markets, and we are committed to advocating for change in rules, policies and practices that better support reliability and overall market development. At the same time we are working for change, we are also taking several steps to refine our internal practices to adapt to the evolving market dynamics.","First, we are taking a far more conservative approach in competitive markets, in light of our current condition. We have increased the risk premium that is built into our retail sales price, which should naturally adjust our glide path strategy to produce a slightly more open position. We currently have 56 million megawatt-hours of committed sales in 2015 and 32 million megawatt-hours committed in 2016.","Next, we have taken deliberate action to essentially close the small, unhedged portion that we typically leave open going into each month, and that is in place for the remainder of the year. As we move into the summer months, we have taken additional actions to layer in further hedges that supplement our position for retail load. Our peaking units are also available for additional support in the event of an extremely hot summer and more volatile prices.","Finally, we have purchased additional outage insurance, something that we haven't felt necessary for about 15 years, to mitigate the impact of volatile prices during the summer. Our results this quarter were affected by a mix of untimely outages and extreme market conditions. We believe that the actions we have already implemented, as well as other conservative measures for the longer term, will help to mitigate the impact of similar market condition should they occur in the future.","Moving now to a review of state regulatory matters. In New Jersey, following the BPU's approval of storm cost stipulation and the return of the 2011 storm costs to the base rate case, the parties were directed to advise ALJ whether additional information is needed before the record is closed. We anticipate a decision in the rate case proceeding later this year. Also in New Jersey, the manner of recovery of the 2012 storm cost remains pending before the BPU.","Turning to West Virginia. Before I talk about our recently filed rate case, I want to briefly mention that on April 23, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia entered an opinion affirming the West Virginia Public Service Commission's order from last October approving the generation asset transfer dealing with the Harrison and Pleasants generating station. As you may recall, we closed this transaction in October after receiving approval from the West Virginia PSC.","Now respecting the West Virginia rate case, last week, our Mon Power and Potomac Edison subsidiaries jointly submitted a request to the Public Service Commission of West Virginia for a base rate increase of approximately $96 million or 9.3% and an allowed ROE of 11%. In addition, the plan includes the request to recover the cost of a new right-of-way vegetation maintenance program through a surcharge. Recently, the West Virginia PSC approved the company's vegetation management plan filed last year but postponed consideration of the method of cost recovery to the rate case. In the meantime, as authorized by the PSC, the companies are implementing the plan and deferring the cost with a 4% annual carry charge. If the requested surcharge is not approved in the rate case, these costs would be incorporated into the company's base rate request. The requested rates are subject to review and approval by the PSC. We expect the case to conclude by the end of February 2015","With respect to our plans to file base rate cases in Pennsylvania, we are concluding our analysis and expect to file later this year. And finally, in Pennsylvania, on March 6, the PUC issued an order approving our original smart meter deployment plan. On March 19, the company has filed an updated plan, consistent with that order, that would allow for the entire Penn Power smart meter system, 170,000 meters, to be built by the end of 2015 instead of the originally proposed installation of 60,000 meters by the end of 2016. A procedural schedule, including a hearing tomorrow, has been established to allow the Pennsylvania PUC to consider the plan by early June. We expect installation to begin this summer.","In Ohio, the PUCO completed its retail market investigation on March 26 by issuing an order that addresses issues ranging from maintaining SSO service in its current form to requiring corporate separation audits of all electric distribution utilities. Also in Ohio, we expect to file an electric security plan, or ESP, before year end. As you know, the current ESP runs through May of 2016, but we need to get started on the process in order to meet the time required to effectively implement a new plant. We expect that most of the main aspects of the filing will be similar, including the continuation of periodic auctions to procure generation for non-shopping customers, as well as the delivery capital recovery rider, which has served us well in terms of providing a mechanism to recover our ongoing investments in reliability at our Ohio utilities.","We are also considering, given the substantial changes in market conditions, whether we should propose an option designed to provide our Ohio customers with more generation price stability and reduced exposure to market volatility. We're still in the early stages of this, and a lot -- and obviously, a lot of thought and discussion with our Ohio colleagues is still to come. It may prove, however, to be an effective way, and perhaps the only way, for Ohio regulators to address the volatility in the market and assure stable prices and adequate supplies for Ohio customers.","With that, I'll hand it off to Jim.","James F. Pearson","Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, you may want to refer to the consolidated report, which was issued this morning and is available on our website. You'll notice that we have redesigned the consolidated report to provide even greater transparency into the performance of our 3 business units: regulated distribution, regulated transmission and competitive energy services.","As Tony mentioned earlier, our first quarter operating earnings of $0.39 per share were within our expectations. These results compare to first quarter 2013 operating earnings of $0.76 per share. On a GAAP basis, first quarter earnings were $0.50 per share this year compared to $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2013. A list of special items that make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings can be found on Page 2 of the consolidated report. The largest of the special items in the first quarter was an $0.18 per share gain primarily related to the sale of our hydro units. We also recorded a gain of $0.03 per share related to mark-to-market adjustments. These gains were partially offset by plant deactivation costs of $0.05 per share associated with the closure of our fossil units, a decrease of $0.02 per share related to merger accounting for commodity contracts, regulatory charges of $0.02 per share and a loss on debt redemptions of $0.01 per share.","Now let's turn to a review of the key drivers in each of our business segments. I'll begin with our distribution business, with operating earnings of $0.53 per share or an increase of $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. Distribution deliveries added $0.09 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. Heating degree-days were about 17% higher than 2013 and 19% above normal, driving a 6% or 2.3 million megawatt-hour increase in deliveries compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Looking at the mix of sales, deliveries to residential customers were up 11%, while commercial sales increased 6%. And as Tony mentioned earlier, when we adjust for the impact of weather, commercial deliveries were up nearly 3%, while residential sales increased about 2%. Deliveries to industrial customers were 1% higher than the first quarter of 2013.","Looking back at the past 12 months. On a weather-adjusted basis, we are seeing about a 1% growth in both the residential and commercial sectors and a 2% increase in industrial deliveries. The growth appears to be somewhat steady. And to reiterate Tony's point, we are in pace to achieve the expected load growth across all 3 sectors of our customer segments this year.","With respect to other drivers in our distribution business, the impact of the West Virginia asset transfer, primarily reflecting the return on the Harrison Plant, increased earnings by $0.01 per share in the first quarter. The weather contributed to higher operating expenses of $0.06 per share during the quarter. This primarily reflects less capital work completed as a result of the extreme weather conditions and storm-related restoration costs, net of deferrals during the quarter. Finally, distribution earnings decreased by $0.03 per share as a result of higher depreciation and interest expense.","Moving to our transmission business. Operating earnings were $0.12 per share or flat compared to the first quarter of 2013 as higher transmission revenues were offset by operating expense and taxes, with most of the higher operating expense due to a greater focus on maintenance activities this quarter. In our competitive business, operating earnings were $0.40 per share below first quarter 2013 results. This was driven by the decrease in commodity margin that resulted from the extreme weather, market conditions and outages that we experienced during the quarter, as Leila described.","Total generating output decreased 4.9 million megawatt-hours, primarily reflecting our 2013 plant deactivations, the Harrison and Pleasants asset transfer and planned and unplanned outages. Total contract sales increased 1.3 million megawatt-hours compared to the first quarter of 2013. The total number of retail customers remained flat at 2.7 million, but the channel mix is shifting, consistent with our strategy to target higher-margin sales opportunities.","Specifically, direct sales to the large and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers decreased 6% as a result of our strategy to be more selective in light of current market conditions. This decrease was offset in the first quarter by sales in other channels. Structured sales increased 42% compared to the first quarter of 2013 as a result of more municipal, cooperative and bilateral sales, partially offset by lower unit prices due to extreme weather and market conditions that reduced the gains on various structured financial sales.","Governmental aggregation sales increased 7%, and POLR sales increased 8%, both reflecting higher weather-related usage. And mass market sales were 19% higher, reflecting the acquisition of new customers, primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as weather-related usage. The impact of the extreme weather and market events on commodity margin was offset somewhat by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the plant deactivations and the asset transfer, and lower interest expense due to long-term debt repurchases.","Finally, I'll take a moment to review financing options that we have completed so far this year. We extended our 3 existing multiyear revolving credit facilities until March of 2019. As part of this transaction, we increased the FirstEnergy and utility facility by $1 billion, we decreased the FES and Allegheny supply facility by $1 billion and amended the transmission facility to allow greater borrowing at our ATSI and TrAIL subsidiaries.","We executed and fully utilized a new $1 billion variable-rate term loan credit agreement with a maturity date of March 2019. Borrowings under this term loan improved our liquidity, as we used proceeds to refinance a like amount of borrowings under FE Corp.'s revolving credit facility. We completed the remarketing of 3 tax-exempt issues totaling $417 million in March at an average coupon of 3.86%, and we received FERC authorization to issue up to $850 million in long-term debt for TrAIL.","While the first quarter presented some unusual challenges with regard to the extreme weather and market conditions, we were pleased overall with the strength of our businesses and our regulated strategy, and we'll continue to focus on our core businesses with a commitment to operational excellence, financial discipline and predictable and sustainable growth opportunities.","Now I'll open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can we just talk a little bit about kind of retail thought process? I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of a reevaluation of kind of sizing and strategy there. Given the first quarter results, what's going to cause you guys maybe to reconsider how much of a short position you create in the retail business? And based on your contractual commitments, where would you look to maybe reduce your exposure if you're going to maybe more balance that business?","Anthony J. Alexander","Dan, let me start with kind of a broad-based overview. When you think about our retail strategy, we've always indicated that it is primarily an asset-backed strategy. And we have used -- and we've increased sales, to a certain extent, probably in the 20% to 25% range, based on sourcing from the overall market. We've been comfortable in that range for a number of years now because the markets have been fairly stable. What we're seeing today, however, and what we experienced this winter, perhaps, is a precursor of what we might be looking at down the road as additional generation is taken offline as a result of environmental requirements, increasing forced outage rates as a result of -- essentially, as a result of depressed overall capacity markets. And quite frankly, as we rely more on natural gas to fill the capacity void, the increased volatility that creates inside the energy markets, electric energy markets because of the volatility associated with natural gas.","And I think all of those are looking -- all of those are leading us to refine our strategy, to see exactly where these targets ought to be, given what we're seeing now as perhaps something that is going to be more of a long-term event in the energy markets, in particular. So not unlike where we started the process, what level of retail sales are -- can be supported by our generation, what is the appropriate level of retail sales to source in the market, if any, and where that mix is will depend much on what happens in retail markets to reflect the risk premiums that will need to be reflected as wholesale markets have far more volatile energy prices in them. And we're going to take that all into consideration. Right now, I feel pretty good about where we're at because the positions we have going forward, quite frankly, where we're at right now, we're more than 100% hedged with our own generation. So it becomes a function of what markets will provide the best opportunities for the competitive business going forward.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, if you look at guidance for this year, the update to the CES contribution came down quite a bit, even though you guys hit the midpoint of the range for the first quarter in aggregate. What's bringing down the next 3 quarters of CES, probably, relative to plan? And then what is the cost or the ongoing cost of, maybe, the new hedging or insurance strategies you're using this year to help protect yourselves?","James F. Pearson","Dan, this is Jim. I'll take a shot at that, and then if Leila and Donny want to add any more cover, I'll hand -- color, I'll hand that off to them. Yes, we hit the midrange of our guidance for this quarter, but several things happened since we gave that guidance, Dan. First off, during the quarter, we did experience better results in our regulated distribution business than what we had expected. We knew that we were going to have higher expenses in the first quarter associated with maintenance expenses, but our revenues were somewhat better than what we expected. And then on the corporate side, we also experienced some benefits against some taxes to a couple of cents.","What happened since the call, on the competitive side, we decided that we were not going to bill several cents of the ancillary services. In addition, PJM reallocated some of their expenses from January, and that impacted us by about $0.02. And then March was rather challenging, as we experienced some fairly cold weather and some extreme wholesale market prices on that side of the house. So with that, we had a decrease somewhat in the competitive side. It was offset, though, by the corporate and the regulated distribution side.","Looking past the first quarter, Dan, we had some additional expenditures that impacted us. First, the Davis-Besse outage that Tony talked about earlier, it impacted us by a couple of cents. And then we also went out and we bought some additional outage insurance, and we closed all of the remaining positions that were opened for the remainder of the year. So when you take all of that together, that is what drove the midpoint of the competitive energy services from $0.42 to $0.17.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so Jim, when you guys look at next year and beyond, should we assume that this higher level of cost for insurance or locking-in-positions is going to be there? Or is that part of the review of where the retail scaling should be?","James F. Pearson","I would say that, that will be part of what the retail review and scaling will be. But at this point, I'm not really expecting that we will go out and purchase that outage insurance on an annual basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick first question here. As you think about the impact of polar vortex, et cetera, in the state of Ohio, how are you seeing their willingness to, perhaps, engage in a more longer-term, PPA-like manner with you all and perhaps how that meshes with your upcoming ESP?","Leila L. Vespoli","Julien, this is Leila. I think they are very focused on that. I think Ohio is not alone in their concern at looking at the polar vortex and the market rules and what they mean in term -- potentially mean in terms of reliability going forward. And I think you're right here in the sense that they dovetail into what might folks want to see within the context of an ESP going forward. So those are the kinds of things that we are looking at now and talking with folks in Ohio about to see what it is that we might do in Ohio that's provided for under Ohio law that might mitigate some of the reliability issues with respect to that and to ensure that they have stable pricing in Ohio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you perhaps just elaborate? How big or substantial are we talking about? What's the ambition here, just to get a better sense?","Leila L. Vespoli","Julien, I -- that is something that's actively being considered. I mean, that's something that we wouldn't decide solely at our end. We would want to be talking with folks and discuss what is the appetite for this kind of things. So that's the thing that's under discussion right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And then on the capacity piece, I'd be curious; obviously, you have a capacity auction coming up. What's your latest thoughts on ATSI are and, ultimately, how that dovetails with, I suppose, your April proposal to shift some of the offered cap [ph] rule.","Leila L. Vespoli","Okay. I'll talk about it generally then turn it over to Donny to maybe give you some more specifics. I think with regard to what FERC has already approved, I think it will have the potential to move the auction a little bit. But I don't think any of the rules currently approved are going to move the auction substantially. I don't think that's consistent with what I'm reading out there. I think longer term, Julien, and what some folks in the industry are talking about among themselves and now with some regulators from a federal level perspective, in order to fix the uneconomic generation issue that folks are talking about, that the Market Monitor talked about in his report, you're going to need more than what PJM has proposed to FERC right now. You're going to need additional changes, both in terms of base residual auction changes that, obviously, wouldn't take place until 3 years out, so I'll call that a longer-term fix.","But you have some companies, Exelon notably one of them, that says they're looking to make decisions in the shorter term. And folks are going to have to concentrate and look at, \"Okay, what might be a shorter-term fix that will take us to a place where you then have fixed the base residual auction 3 years out?\" One of the things that folks are talking about is on-site fuel and looking to give units with on-site fuel some kind of premium in a market that they certainly don't get now, tying into the concept of fuel diversity. So those are some of the kind of things that I would like to see happen. But certainly, not something that we're going to see in an upcoming auction. But with that, I'll turn it over to Donny and his thoughts on the upcoming auction.","Donald R. Schneider","She said it pretty well, Julien. I don't have a lot to add. I mean, you kind of think of the plus and minus, if you will. On the plus side, if you're a generator, you've got the retirements that are out there. You've got the import limits. You've got the change that they made to DR. You at least have some suggestion about the arbitrage issues. Whether that gets done before the auction or not, who knows? But on the minus side of the ledger, you've got load forecast is down. You've got a lot of new generation in the queue. We'll have to see what happens there with that new generation. I think that's kind of the wildcard for the upcoming auction, if you will. And generally, I'd agree with Leila. It's possible to see this needle move a little bit in a favorable direction, but not nearly enough to sustain what the PJM needs from a reliability perspective going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And just a clarification on Dan's last question there, if you don't mind. If you complete your review, could this drive a higher level of maintenance CapEx going forward? Does that change at all?","James F. Pearson","I don't see when anything that's happened, Julien, this is Jim, that would drive any additional maintenance CapEx.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just looking at the fact book that you guys put out and Slide 151, I guess, the issue of free cash flow. It looks like it's substantially down. Now part of because of the lower income in the guidance. But there's also what appears to be a considerable higher level of collateral, I guess, that you guys expected. And this other item, other seems to have swung kind of negative. And I was just wondering if this is -- how much of this might be sort of an ongoing free cash flow situation that we should think about in 2015 and beyond versus sort of a polar vortex issue now?","James F. Pearson","Paul, this is Jim. I would say you hit it right. A big driver of that is the earnings that are down. So I would say that's probably associated with at least...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It looks like $100 million. The rest of it -- almost $400 million, it looks like, could be...","James F. Pearson","I would say there's about $350 million there. We had -- in the first quarter, our collateral, it was up $419 million over the first quarter of last year. We did get some of that collateral returned to us when PJM reset their collateral requirements. We did get about $275 million back. So my expectation is collateral may be somewhat higher for a period of time, but not to the extent we have it right now.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that other item that looked like it was almost $250 million swing almost, what is that? And does that continue?","James F. Pearson","What's the other item you're looking at?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, just when we look at cash before other items, you've got high drags on sales, collateral, then other. And other seems like it's $194 million negative now, whereas last year -- I mean, excuse me, last numbers you guys gave was a positive $50 million. So I'm just wondering what's that, and does it continue? I mean, how do we think about 2015, I guess, and going forward in terms of what...","James F. Pearson","I wouldn't -- that's a working capital item, Paul, so I would not expect that to continue like that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Can you tell us what it was? Or I can follow up offline.","James F. Pearson","You can follow up offline.","Irene M. Prezelj","Paul, will you give me a call after the conference call, and we'll run that to ground for you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay, fine. And then just in terms of SB 310, there have been some news reports about some changes and amendments to it, perhaps. And I'm just wondering what you guys think about those potential amendments and what you think the outlook for getting this thing done is, and if you could just address that a little bit.","Leila L. Vespoli","Paul, this is Leila. That is something that changes almost hourly. I do think they are posed to do something. I do think you're right in the sense that the different parties are looking at that and putting forward different compromise proposals as we go along. I can't say that I have a perfect crystal ball as to what's going to come out the other end. But I think, directionally, they are probably going to put forward something that is very positive. I don't think it will look like exactly what has been originally contained in the legislation. But I think from a perspective of saving customers' money in terms of energy efficiency requirements, I think it will come out positive. And I think, hopefully, they're slated to do something, yes, this week in the Senate.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about 2015 EBITDA for the competitive operations. And we've obviously seen a fairly large runup in power prices. To what extent does that factor in? I honestly would have thought perhaps EBITDA would be a bit higher, given the runup. Can you maybe talk through how the change in commodity prices impacts that 2015 EBITDA?","James F. Pearson","At this point, Stephen, we have not updated our 2015 EBITDA for the open positions we have right now. So if those open positions are filled at a higher energy price, as we're seeing, then you could see that being driven up. But I'll leave Leila to give you some more color on that.","Leila L. Vespoli","Actually, Stephen, I think, right now, with respect to our current sales levels in 2015, roughly sold the 56 million. If you were to not sell anything further going into it, just sell it at the current forward market prices, I think we would be within that range of EBITDA. So I think, right now, although we -- obviously, that's something we're going to continue to examine as we go forward, I think we are comfortably within the range and are -- as I said, continue to look at it as we go forward.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But -- not to press on this too much, but since the last update, I mean, we've seen a very large move in commodity prices. I guess I would have expected that, given that you do have a fair amount of open position there, that the EBITDA would be higher. Are there other offsets or other things we should be thinking about?","Leila L. Vespoli","I think one of the things you need to think about is the sustainability of the pricing going forward. That's something that we continue to look at. And as Tony mentioned, as we go forward, we're going to be looking at a different mixture of things, potentially. So again, that's something that we will continue to evaluate as we go forward. But right now, we feel comfortable kind of within that range as currently shown.","Donald R. Schneider","Yes. I think, Stephen, just to add to that. This is Donny. If you think about where we're at today, Leila mentioned, for 2015, we've sold about 56 terawatt-hours. If you use -- we've given you a range on generation, but -- 75 to 80. If you just pick 76 as our generation, that would say that against our generation, we're about 20 terawatt-hours open. The market's moved kind of roughly about $6 for cal year '15, so you're at about $120 million, and I think our range was right at about $100 million. So what we're saying is things are looking better, obviously, from a wholesale perspective. We've got a nice open position. We haven't quite figured out where we're going with retail sales, so to speak. So just a lot of things in flux there that kind of boil down, and we'll probably be updating that later this year.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I see. So there has been -- the move upward, that does help you achieve that and helps you feel better about where you might be in that range, it sounds like.","Donald R. Schneider","Yes. No question, the upward movement in the market is always desirable.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My -- not to beat a dead horse, but just to follow up with -- along the lines of the last question. Leila, I just want to make sure I heard correctly, you said that you've sold 56 terawatt hours -- or committed to sell 56 in '15 and committed to sell 32 in '16?","Leila L. Vespoli","Correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And one would presume, given that power prices are up, that your plants would dispatch more. So you've given a range of generation output of 75 to 80 in both those years. Shouldn't I presume that you'd be closer to 80, as with prices up and volatility up, you'd probably run more? Because if I do -- if I run the deltas on power prices from the end of the year, I actually come up with more like a little over $200 million in incremental EBITDA in '15 on 24 terawatt-hour delta. So in order for that -- in order for you to not be above the last range, something would have had to have changed on the negative side in your P&L.","Leila L. Vespoli","Greg, I think your first comment was fair, but I'm going to turn it over to Donny to address the latter piece.","Donald R. Schneider","Yes. No, Greg, I think you're directionally correct. There's nothing that's changed in the P&L that would create downward pressure for '15. We are still evaluating where we want to be with retail sales, how we might want to play the wholesale market, for example. So that's really what's driving the fact that we haven't updated that range.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then all things equal in '16, you are long a little less than 50 terawatt-hours today, correct?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes. With the 32 that's under contract, and you can plan on us generating somewhere, again, in the 75 to 80 terawatt-hours. That will leave you about -- just short of 50 terawatt hours open.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. At what point do you think you guys will be ready to give us some sort of a mark-to-market or sensitivity analysis on your position as commodity markets do change?","Leila L. Vespoli","Greg, that's something that we're working on, and we should be in position to do in some future call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Naz Comuala [ph] with Fidelity Investments.","Unknown Analyst","I just had a question for you. I wanted to ask about coal piles and if you had any deliverability issues, and just if you could speak to that going into the summer.","Anthony J. Alexander","Okay. I think our stockpiles are about 24, 25 days right now. We would typically have about 30. So my sense is we probably had some -- experienced some issues this winter, but I wouldn't classify them as significant or overall substantial, the type of things that we typically see, although this winter was a little more challenging on the Ohio river than normal. So we're pretty comfortable with where our inventories are at and our ability to continue to build those as we move into the summer to then have adequate inventories as we move into next winter.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Have you had to burn any gas in order to keep your coal piles at a certain level, or it's all been normal on that front?","Anthony J. Alexander","It's all been normal on the front.","James F. Pearson","This is Jim. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. For those of you who are still in the queue to ask a question, a member of the IR department will reach out to you.","Our 3 core businesses, distribution, transmission and competitive energy services, provide us with the flexibility to capture value for our investors. Our first quarter results in our distribution and transmission businesses were within our expectations, and we are encouraged by continued signs of a more substantial economic recovery in our service area.

I'm Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I want to thank you for coming to FirstEnergy's Analyst Meeting today. Before I review this morning's agenda, I'd like to point your attention to the slide, which is also available in your presentation book. It contains the Safe Harbor statement, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For those listening on the webcast, this is also contained in the materials posted on our website. Please review this document closely as you consider the comments we will be making today. We have a full agenda and we'll kick the meeting off with Tony Alexander, our President and CEO. Tony will be followed by Mark Clark, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide our financial outlook. Mark will be followed by Chuck Jones, President of our Utilities Group, who will review our regulated utility and transmission operations. Mark and Chuck will take questions after their presentations. We're planning a short break following Chuck's presentation; and then we'll have Jim Lash, President of FE Generation and our Chief Nuclear Officer. Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions will follow Jim; and Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President and General Counsel rounds out our speaker list today. Tony will return to close the meeting, and he will take questions at that time. ","Members of the IR team will be in the audience with microphones. Since today's meeting is being webcast, I would ask those with a question to wait for the microphone so that everyone in the room and on the webcast can hear it. Finally, I'd like to announce that FirstEnergy is introducing an iPad app for investors today. This is a screenshot of the app, and you'll also see with your materials in front of you, the QR code that you can easily scan with your device here today. We will be introducing an iPhone app, shortly, that you'll also be able to get. The app can be accessed through our website or by going through the Apple Store and searching for FirstEnergy investors. We hope you will find this information useful. With that, I'll turn things over to Tony.","Anthony J. Alexander","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing FirstEnergy's strategy, our plans to grow our business, and how we expect to increase shareholder value. It's been about a year since we completed our merger with Allegheny Energy, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. Yet as you listen to the presentations today, you'll recognize that the merger is just one of the positive steps we have taken to better position FirstEnergy for the future. Let me start by saying our strategy hasn't changed. We operate 3 businesses, and have a substantial position in each. We draw first, flexibility, growth opportunities and financial stability. Our Distribution business has the largest regulated customer base in the United States. Our Transmission business is one of the largest holders of independent transmission assets in the nation. And our Generation business, operates one of the country's largest and most diversified competitive generating fleets.","We do not need to grow our businesses by expanding rate base. Instead, we will continue to operate our company as we have in the past with a focus on our core businesses, operational excellence, retail sales growth and delivering solid financial results for our investors, including a strong dividend and investment grade credit ratings.","Building on this foundation, I'm confident that our competitive business model, our diverse generating assets and the scale of our utility service area will help us become one of, if not the best-positioned company, in our industry.","Today, we'll talk about our recent achievements, and our initiatives going forward. We'll discuss our plans to achieve the earnings guidance we've outlined, despite the headwinds faced by our entire industry. I will explain why FirstEnergy's position overall, provides a solid base to grow shareholder value, as the economy improves. ","Let me start with the Allegheny merger. It has been a terrific success story from the start. We worked through the merger approval process in about a year, an outstanding accomplishment in our industry, and the integration was even better than we expected. In fact, the merger has gone so well, that it sometimes seems like Allegheny has always been a part of FirstEnergy. The people and the assets are a very good fit. We essentially began operating as a unified organization from day one. We exceeded our first year synergy goals, and everything is in place to capture the savings up opportunities we've identified. At this point, we are making all business decisions as an integrated company. And as a result, tracking merger-specific synergies is no longer necessary, and we will no longer be doing it. And quite frankly, the way we operate the company, it would be a distraction. ","In 2011, we also achieved considerable success with our retail sales strategy. FirstEnergy solutions, our competitive subsidiary, captured new customers in Pennsylvania, and increased its governmental aggregation businesses in Ohio and Illinois. It now serves nearly 2 million customers across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Maryland. We sell about 100 million megawatt hours directly to retail customers, and that's more than we did as a regulated company. Later this morning, Donny Schneider will talk more about our retail strategy, and how we are building a strong foundation for future growth.","When we met with you last spring, we described our plans to continue delivering solid financial results, positive cash flow and a stronger balance sheet. Last year, we sold non-core assets like the Fremont Energy Center, the Richland and Stryker plants and a partial interest in the Signal Peak coal mine, and took other actions to reduce debt by $2.4 billion. We also recently adopted a change in our pension accounting method. And we made other -- and we made another significant contribution to our pension plan last month, that reduces the unfunded portion of our liability. As a result, we've driven our debt-to-equity ratio down to about 57%, and we will continue our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position. Mark Clark will talk about the actions we are exploring to further enhance our financial profile, including opportunities related to the Bruce Mansfield sale leaseback arrangement, and the recent Ohio legislation that allows for securitization of deferrals.","While we still have work to do, we are in a much better position today to meet the challenges of our industry. One of those key challenges is that our region is still stressed by the sluggish economy. For example, while industrial sales are improving with growth that facilities at GM Lordstown's plant, Chrysler Jeep in Toledo, and AK Steel in Butler, Pennsylvania, industrial sales are not as strong as anyone would like. We are also seeing limited residential and commercial growth. Although again, we do have pockets of very robust commercial activity, particularly in the healthcare, and in both Ohio and Pennsylvania, as the Marcellus and Utica shale fields are being developed. Overall however, sales have not yet recovered to the levels we had in 2007. In the current rate of economic growth, it is not strong enough to support higher power prices. Even though we're encouraged by increased capacity prices starting in 2014, overall improvement will depend on a host of market conditions including and primarily, the strength of the U.S. economy.","One of the factors however, is -- that's also likely to impact what's going on, that is environmental regulations. And what they could do from a standpoint of cost of producing as well as the supply of electricity. These new environmental mandates will have an impact on FirstEnergy. For example, we recently decided to retire some older, less efficient Fossil units in response to EPA's stringent new standards known as MACT and other environmental regulations. We will however, make the investments needed to ensure that our remaining plants are competitive in the future. And we will focus our resources on the units that will remain in place over the long term. We've already reduced these investments by roughly half of what we anticipated last year. And we will continue to aggressively seek low-cost solutions or compliance and options to further reduce these capital costs. Jim Lash will talk more about our efforts and the expected impact of the environmental regulations on our fleet.","Once our older Fossil units are retired, nearly 100% of the power we produce will come from resources that are low or non-emitting. Last night, we provided 2012 non-GAAP guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share. We also updated guidance for 2013 of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. The midpoint of each of these is within the range of guidance we provided last year. While these are not easy times for anyone in our industry, we are facing these challenges head-on as we always have. You can count on our management team to continue to drive costs and revenues, identify opportunities, and deliver on the commitments we've made to you. This is truly an exciting time for the company. The strength of FirstEnergy, rests on the diversity of its operations and the flexibility and responsiveness of its employees. And we are better positioned than ever, to grow, compete and increase shareholder value. Your support has been and continues to be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ","Now, I'm going to turn the podium over to Mark, and the rest of my senior management team will provide more details on the key areas of focus for 2012 and 2013. After each presentation, we'll provide time for your questions. And as Irene said, I'll be back at the end to close the meeting, and I will also be available for questions at that time. Okay, let's get started. Mark?","Mark T. Clark","Thanks, Tony. Good morning. Before I start, I'd like to thank everyone for being with us today. We do appreciate it. As Tony said, no question, 2011 was a more than interesting year. Either selling assets, dealing with the weather, the integration of FirstEnergy, despite that we think we had a solid year. And we're looking forward to the next 2 years. My presentation today is going to cover 2 topics: First, I'm going to review 2011, and then I'll speak a little bit to 2012 and 2013. I suppose it would help if I put the slide up. But -- let me speak to 2012. As Tony just said, non-GAAP earnings for the year were $3.64, and GAAP earnings were $2.22 per share. Last May I stood up here and said our guidance would be $3.20 to $3.50, we changed that as we went through the year. We upped it a little bit. Now, we've ended the year at $3.60 -- $3.64. And also, a lot has happened between then and now, and I'll admit that this is an extraordinarily busy slide. But it does somewhat capture both the headwinds and the successes that we had last year. Three big impacts in terms of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, 2 negative, 1 positive. On the negative side, we have the mark-to-market adjustment for the pension accounting, which was $0.78. We had the generation impairment, which was $0.52 and as Tony alluded to on the positive side, we had Signal Peak, which was $0.93.","Specific to the fourth quarter, weather was anything but cooperative. It was 17% below normal, and more than 20% below the fourth quarter of 2010. Generation output as you'll see on the upper right-hand side was down, as were wholesale sales. On the plus side, we continued to move customers from the polar side of the equation to the direct retail side of the equation. FirstEnergy solutions has done a great job with this, and I'm not going to stand up here and take Donny's thunder away from him. He'll be up here in a little bit. And the other important part of this slide is if you look at the lower left-hand corner, you'll see that Allegheny was accretive in its first full year although it was only accounted for 10 months. But it was accretive for the year.","Let's look at the segment earnings. Last May was the first time we broke out the segments, and we continue to do so. You'll see that our regulated Distribution and our Transmission business more than support a solid dividend on the regulated side of the equation by itself, and our competitive business continues to grow and continues to be the underlying growth platform for the company. And again, I would remind you that Allegheny was only there for 10 months of the year. On the capital side of the equation, for the year, we spent about $2.4 billion, which is somewhat in line with 2 exceptions. First, we spent roughly $200 million on storms, principally related to Hurricane Irene and the October snowstorm. Chuck's going to give some perspective around the historic magnitude of those storms against some of the storms we had historically, and I think you will agree that these were well outside the norm.","Also included in the capital is $257 million for the pension accounting change in terms of capitalizing overheads. And as I said, absent the storms and the pension accounting, we actually would have come in lower than what we've anticipated last May. We accomplished just about everything we set out to, in terms of 2011 financial initiatives. As Tony alluded to, synergy earnings were $270 million against our internal target of $210 million. So we're well ahead of where we thought we'd be. That's on the earnings basis. On a cash basis, it's $300 million. I know we talked about selling assets for quite a bit of time. We actually finally got that done. We sold the Fremont plant, we sold the Richland\/Stryker peaking unit, and as Tony alluded to, we sold 1\/3 interest in Signal Peak. Those 3 items alone contributed $800 million of cash to the company. ","More specific to Signal Peak, it resulted in a gain of $370 million, an equity increase of $50 million, and a deconsolidation of debt of $360 million. Signal Peak by itself, improved their balance sheet $1 billion. That's not bad for a project that started in 2008. In June, we successfully replaced our existing credit facilities with 2 separate facilities. We plan on beginning talks with our banks this year to extend those maturities to give us even more flexibility. So on a personal note, I'd like to thank all the bankers in the room for all their support, and I can assure you that both Jim and Steve [ph] will be contacting you shortly about the extensions. ","Similar to the financial initiatives, we made great progress with respect to the balance sheet. We eliminated $2.4 billion worth of debt, and importantly, and this is an important point, we aligned the regulated cap structures of the operating company with the regulated structure of which their rates are set. We continue to look for opportunities to strengthen the balance sheet that as I repeatedly said, we are not going to pay on economic premiums just simply to acquire debt. One reason the pension contribution made so much sense was that it reduced the liability, it was tax-deductible, and we didn't pay a premium. And we picked that number not for some unknown reason, the $600 million, but we believe when the discount rate goes back to 6%, we will be fully funded on the pension side. We expect that GAAP to be closed, and that takes nothing more than the 10-year treasury to get to 4%, which is more than reasonable. And we ended the year in a very strong liquidity position at $5.1 billion.","Now probably 90% of you are in this room just to see this slide and how the hell we got to $3.30 to $3.60 and $3.10 to $3.40. And I'm going to start at the top of the slide and I want to specifically speak to 2012, but the same logic applies to 2013. Last May, we gave guidance of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. You know that in 2011, we've changed the pension accounting, which added $0.20 per share. So all things being equal, if nothing else changed, I'd be standing up here telling you the guidance was $3.40 to $3.70 per share. Unfortunately, some things do change. We have a sluggish economy, we have an unprecedented drop in natural gas prices, we have some pension cost changes and labor cost changes. The biggest item there is power prices. And that has the negative effect of changing our guidance by $0.20 per share. On the positive side, we've taken a number of actions to mitigate that drop. Tony just alluded to our announcement of closing 3,300 megawatts of unscrubbed coal-fired capacity. Donny is going to speak too, in greater detail, how we're moving customers around the retail channel to ensure greater margin, and we continue to look for opportunities to reduce O&M. I just want to give you one, very quick example, of what we're doing on the O&M side.","We closed the transaction February 28 of last year. There are roughly 75 major applications that have to get integrated between the 2 companies. For some of the operating savings to occur, those systems have to be integrated. I'm pleased to say that our IT folks are basically going to integrate all of those applications in record time, and they'll make their cut-over shortly. They've had 5 test runs, so you'll see that some of the synergy has been accelerated and some of the synergies too, become, as we integrate our systems. And we're quite pleased with where we are. We'll continue to look for incremental costs. It's kind of our nature. But we're not going to do anything simply for a short-term benefit that puts the company at a longer-term risk. That's just not something we are going to do. Everything we are doing is to place FirstEnergy in the best possible forward position.","We'll talk about segment earnings again. It's the same as what I talked about in 2011. The regulated side of the business produces significant, strong, solid earnings for the earnings -- for the dividend. We made one little change in the Transmission piece here. The regulated Distribution -- or excuse me, the regulated Transmission is now included in the regulated independent transition -- Transmission. Excuse me. That's roughly $0.24 a share. We think we've done that for the right reason. It brings out greater clarity in terms of what's truly Distribution and what's truly Transmission. And again, despite a very challenging environment, our competitive business unit continues to deliver positive earnings and Donny will speak about that a little bit.","On capital. We're looking at capital completely differently than we looked at capital in the past. First, our baseline capital stays at around $2 billion. We broken out environmental spend, some of the Japanese nuclear spend and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency, as you know, is recovered to the regulatory process while nuclear cost associated with Japan are not that great. We used a plug figure last year and told you that we used a number of around $100 million, so we wanted to correct that and bring that up to current, and it's roughly more like $20 million. And this is the first time we're starting to include capital numbers for MACT. That number will grow, but that number is significantly below what our prior estimates were. And Jim Lash is going to get into that a little bit further. ","As I said, we're looking to capital completely differently. You'll take a power plant, we might look at it and say, if we put a Rapid rail unloader there, we might be able to bring western coal into that plant. That Rapid rail unloader's $20 million. Okay? Treasury gets $20,000, in investment income. The plant burns about 4 million to 5 million tons. I only need a $0.04 change in the price of that coal to offset what I would have done in the Rapid rail unloader. ","You have to look at capital differently in terms of how you deploy it. Maybe the fix for a power plant isn't to put the equipment on today. Maybe it's to coal fire it for a while and then decide where the market's going. But the point I want to make about capital and Jim's going to talk about that in greater depth, is that we're looking at capital completely differently than we would have been on a historical basis.","Similar to 2011, we have financial initiatives that we have teed up for this year. Tony already alluded to the pension contribution. We're planning to restructure the $4.5 billion worth of credit facilities by extending their maturities from 2016 to 2017, and we're planning to replace the $450 million trail credit facility, with a $500 million facility at the Transmission holding company level. We think that will give us even more flexibility. Additionally, we intend to file an application with the PUCO, seeking an order pursuant to the new securitization legislation, which should also assist us in our planned debt reduction efforts at the Ohio utilities. Tony mentioned the possible early buyout to the Mansfield sale leaseback of 700-plus megawatts. We believe that this is the bright time to look at that and get that transaction done. In terms of cash flow, we're about where we thought we'd be for 2012 after you take out the pension and make an adjustment for the Mansfield sale leaseback purchase. For 2013, this is the first year that we're going to include the environmental spend and obviously we've updated for the sluggish economies so cash is going to be affected by both of those.","When I look back at 2011, there was no question, we had some significant headwinds. But despite all that, we made significant success on the financial side of the equation. Going into 2012, we will stay focused on what's really important and what really matters. It's managing our capital program, maximizing the value of every single kilowatt hour we sell, strengthening the balance sheet and remain fully committed to a strong and stable dividend. Everything we're doing is to place FirstEnergy in the best position going forward. We accomplished a great deal in '11, and I expect us to accomplish a great deal in '12. And if you bear with me for a moment, I'd like to end on a personal note.","Now back 2, 2.5 decades ago, when I was Treasurer of the company, one of the financial institutions ranked financial performance above the electric utilities in the industry. There were 104 on that list. You might remember 104 was Long Island Lighting that went bankrupt. We were listed 103, and the commentary was that this company was going to go bankrupt or be taken over. Well, as Tony alluded to today, we have the largest electric distribution system with over 6 million customers. We are one of the largest integrated independent transmission systems, and we're one of the largest and most diversified generation fleets. And why am I bringing this up now? Because I think FirstEnergy has a seasoned management team that's been through the fires. It's a management team that knows what's important. And most importantly, it's a management team that knows how to get things done. Thank you all very much, and I'd be happy I guess, to take some questions. Thanks. I'm like Tony, sitting down, I'm done.","Question-and-Answer Session","Mark T. Clark","Yes, Paul? [ph]","Unknown Analyst","Can you talk about the implications of the sale leaseback, just from a financial perspective?","Mark T. Clark","It would be accretive to earnings. We think with the power prices down, it's the right time to purchase it. We've made estimates that will affect our cash flow. It will affect that, but it should be accretive over the remaining term of it.","Unknown Analyst","Can you quantify that?","Mark T. Clark","It is roughly, Jimmy, what? $0.16 over the 3 or 4 years? Something in that range? Yes. When you add in, it's all net-net debt.","Carrie Saint Louis","I wanted to start with your comment about the MACT spending, that it was below prior expectations of that $2 billion to $3 billion before?","Mark T. Clark","Yes, we used the figure last May, and it was kind of a more of a swag estimate of $2 billion to $3 billion. Jim is going to talk about that a lot more but the estimate now is $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion, and we're still working on it. But I'll let Jim speak to that. I don't want to take his thunder. He's got a slide on that and gets into great detail on it.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay. And then, you said, it wasn't clear, the -- I guess, the cash flow slides on the Appendix, it was Bruce Mansfield and the 2012 cash flow guidance. The page that lays out your free cash flow for 2012, does that include the buyout of the Bruce?","Mark T. Clark","Yes.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay, what bucket is that in or is that some kind of...","Mark T. Clark","It's just inherent in the numbers.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay. So that's free cash flow of basically 0 where negative 100 includes that?","Mark T. Clark","Right. The point was that the forecast that we gave last May would not have included the pension contribution and did not include the Mansfield. That's right.","Carrie Saint Louis","And then lastly on the energy efficiency spending, because that steps up a lot in '13. Just what's the trend for that? Like how could we think about that, kind of, on a go-forward basis?","Mark T. Clark","I think Chuck had alluded to that, but it's probably going to stay in that, slightly increase as we go forward. It's recovered to the regulatory process. I know the regulators are looking whether that's the most efficient use of capital, so I think that's a good number. I don't know Chuck, you want to change that?","Charles E. Jones","No, Mark's correct. We have abilities to recover all of it through the regulatory process, so while we spend it, we get it right back.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay. Sorry, I had one more. What was it I was going to ask? I can't remember now. I'll come back to it.","Unknown Analyst","You didn't comment about your dividend for this year going forward. What's the plan?","Mark T. Clark","I think we have a solid dividend today, supported by the regulated side of the business. The Board looks at the dividend. I think we've said in the past, that we're going to have a policy that's consistent, understandable and sustainable. And I think that's where it is today. If the market changes and the prices change a little bit, we will look at it. But it's strong and stable today, and it's where it is. Steve?","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, just a follow-up to that question. First, when you say we look at it, I assume you mean, we look at it upward?","Mark T. Clark","That would be an understatement, yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Just on balance sheet and cash flow metrics. Where did the balance sheet, maybe debt to capital end, at the end of '11? And where do you project it to be at the end of this period, and maybe same thing on the FFO metrics?","Mark T. Clark","I think you have to look at it like we look at it, which is each individual component. The regulated side of the business on the Distribution side, we looked at to keep that at roughly 50-50, maybe a little bit higher debt. On the Transmission side, we look at keeping that 50-50, maybe a little bit higher on the equity side. On the holding company side, as much as we'd like to, the premium on that debt is too high, so we can't acquire it. We're not going to with those premiums. And so that leaves the FES side, and that is deleveraged. And one of the issues that we're dealing with for this year is we'll pay down the Allegheny Energy System-$503 million debt and we'll try to deleverage that business and strengthen that as we go forward. On the FFO, I think, Jimmy, we're at what? 18%, 19%? It takes roughly $1 billion to move it up, a percentage or so. We do have the $500 million, the $300 million, if we do some securitizations, some other things. We should significantly improve that over the -- for the course of the year.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last question on the mix of earnings. It looks like for 2011, if you go back to the May, the presentation last year, most of the -- you actually beat a lot on the regulated side, your old projection. And it seems to sustain into 2012, '13. Is that mainly the merger synergies doing better and we're seeing it there? Is that the pension adjustment or...","Mark T. Clark","I think the pension, the merger synergies are in that mix, but I can just give you an example. We have a program called, work management initiative, where we're automating portions of the physical workforce and the utilities. Putting hard laptops in the trucks, allowing them to be -- GPS in the trucks, eliminating a lot of the paperwork that they have to do, and having the computer optimize their schedule rather than having a supervisor optimize their schedule. Some of the benefits that hasn't been rolled out across all of the opcos, but the benefits are 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% in increased efficiency in wrench time. So that's a big issue. We're becoming more efficient. Chuck's group has done a phenomenal job in holding their costs down. And I would expect he'd continue to do that. So I don't think you want to look at just one item. It's kind of a series of items. Chuck, you want to add anything to any of your successes?","Charles E. Jones","Nope, you did well. Thank you.","Mark T. Clark","Okay. I'll just turn it over to you.","Charles E. Jones","Okay, good morning. Over the next 20 to 30 minutes or so, I'm going to update you on our regulated businesses. I'll first cover our 9 utilities, then spend some time on our Transmission business segment. And then following both of those, I'll take a few questions. For both business segments, I want to give you some highlights of our operating philosophy, review some of the highlights of the past year, and share some of our key financial metrics. As you can see from the map, and Tony already referred to this, last year's merger with Allegheny Energy has helped us put together a significant Utility business. We have over 6 million customers across 6 states, which makes us the largest at this time in the industry. And the fact that all 6 million customers are served in a contiguous service territory gives us operational benefits that can be easily shared across all of our utilities. Our customer profile has spread almost equally between residential, commercial and industrial customers, creating a well-balanced portfolio and strong, stable, regulated cash flow. Because we operate in 6 states, our footprint also provides us with regulatory diversity and minimizes exposure from any one jurisdiction. ","Our operating philosophy is pretty simple. Our goal is to operate reliably and efficiently. Operating reliably and meeting customer expectations ensures we remain in good stead with our regulators. Today, all of our utility operating companies except Mon Power, have reliability targets that are regulated by our state utility commissions. And in 2011, all of our companies except Penelec, were able to achieve those targets. Operating efficiently ensures we deliver on the financial commitments that we've made to our first energy parent and ultimately to all of you. Since 2008, we have significantly reduced O&M spending, and expect to hold it at current levels for the foreseeable future. ","In 2011, we delivered strong financial results that Mark's already talked about. The combination of our Utilities and Transmission business delivered 2\/3 of our company's earnings, helping FirstEnergy meet its earnings commitments. We were also able to generate strong cash flow from our utilities that was adequate to cover the company's dividend payments. In 2011, we also made great progress on completing the merger of Potomac Edison, Mon Power and West Penn Power into FirstEnergy. We successfully implemented our regional model for how we like to run our utilities. This approach allows us to kind of deal with the company-by-company, state-by-state issues that are inherently different from operating company-to-operating company. We've used a sister company approach to help ensure we get up to speed quickly. We have assigned a legacy FirstEnergy Utility management team to work with each of the new management teams. Experienced managers work closely with their counterparts in the new companies to help them adapt to new FirstEnergy policies and business processes. This is the third merger that we've done, major merger since 1997, Tony referred to it. And I'd say by far, it's been the smoothest integration of the 3. Though culturally, Allegheny had a similar feel to the way we like to do business at FirstEnergy, and all the employees and leaders that have joined our company, have approached this merger with a very positive, can-do, attitude. ","We also achieved the merger synergy targets that we were assigned for FirstEnergy Utilities. In fact, we were able to double our assigned cash synergy in 2011. Mark said the final step to completing integration will occur in a few weeks, when we complete the cut-over of the Allegheny IT systems to our FirstEnergy platforms. This will allow us to finalize all the business processes and eliminate some temporary manual workarounds that we put in place over the past year. ","And no review of 2011 would be complete without talking a little bit about storms. It seems like that's all I've talked about for the past year. In August of 2011, we took a step back and we analyzed where we were at it with storm, SAIDI minutes at that time, and we were at 65% of our SAIDI minutes, were due to storm activity. On a normal year, we would have been at 35%. Through July, we dealt with ice storm in January, several significant thunderstorm events and 2 tornadoes. And it was at that point, the worst storm year we've ever seen. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. Hurricane Irene decided to plow right through our Eastern part of our territory. We barely gotten cleaned up from that one, when we had a severe winter storm hit in late October, which was unseasonable for that time of year for that area that we serve. Both of these storms allowed us to demonstrate one of the strengths I mentioned of a contiguous utility footprint. We were able to quickly deploy more than 4,000 FirstEnergy employees, including hundreds, and in one case, even into the thousands ahead of when the storms actually hit. Both of these storms were devastating in terms of magnitudes of customers that were impacted and as well of cost to repair the damage. And you can see some of the numbers here. ","Hurricane Irene was the first hurricane to make a direct hit on New Jersey and the mid-Atlantic regions since 2000 -- or since 1907. Not only was there significant wind damage throughout the territory but severe flooding hampered repairs. In the end, we employed a total of over 8,000 employees and contractors, and spent $89 million to complete repairs from the storm. I mentioned the October snowstorm was unseasonable for this part of the country. In fact, the areas that we serve that were impacted by the storm had seen less than 3 inches of snowfall in October in the last 100-plus years added together. For this storm, including the FirstEnergy employees that I've already mentioned, we had over 9,000 employees and contractors working to restore service and spent over $125 million. Snowfall, while the trees still hold their leaves, is by far the worst type of event we can have. And it's even more damaging as you can see than a hurricane rolling right through the middle of your territory. And mother nature normally takes care of that, gets the leaves down before we get to snow, but every now and then, she gets her signals crossed, I think.","While I think we did a good job, both of these storms provided us great opportunities to learn. We've never dealt with storms of this magnitude in our history before. One key learning was the amount of communication necessary to keep our customers, safety forces, elected officials and regulators fully informed of the amount of damage and the status of repairs. Because we've never experienced a storm of this kind of magnitude, I don't have to say we underestimated what was needed from a communications perspective during Hurricane Irene. But immediately following Hurricane Irene, we are able to take these lessons learned and develop a more robust communications plan that served us well. And you can see some of the things we did. We used social media for the first time, got ahead of the storm in terms of some news conferences and really ramped up what we did from a communications perspective. ","And this is the slide Mark alluded to. I think it truly puts the magnitude of these 2 storms in perspective. You can see the repair costs for a dozen of our more recent events. Before Hurricane Irene, the worst storm in our history was Hurricane Ike in 2008. Hurricane Ike came up from the Gulf into Ohio, made a 90-degree turn and rolled right through pretty much all of our service territory and impacted about 1 million customers. Its repair costs though was only $42 million. Hurricane Irene more than doubled that cost and the October snowstorm trebled that cost. And then one final number on storms, in a normal year, we only budget about $65 million to $70 million for storm repairs for the entire year. So, it was a tough year, storm-wise. I'm tired of talking about it. You're probably wondering how we were able to deliver the strong financial results with all of these costs. And I'd say it has to do with the forward-looking view of some of our state regulators and the work of our regulatory affairs team. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio we have mechanisms in place to deal with excess of costs from storms of this magnitude. And the 2011 income statement impact of both of these storms combined was less than $10 million.","Clearly, they were terrible storms, I'm very proud of the efforts of all of our Utility employees who worked to restore service following these. But despite their efforts, we had a number of customers and communities that were understandably upset about how long it takes -- took us to restore all the customers. We continue to work to address some of the remaining issues from these 2 events. ","There's another perspective that I want to share with you and that has to do with a recent announcement by J.D. Power & Associates. For 13 years, J.D. Power & Associates has been conducting customer satisfaction surveys throughout the utility industry. One thing we've learned over those 13 years is that commercial customers are generally the most discerning in terms of reliability. And it's due to the fact that in many cases, if the power goes out, they lose revenue that they can never make up while the power is out.","And you can see here from the results that in 2011, the 2 companies that were most impacted by both of these 2 storms Met-Ed and Jersey Central Power & Light, the 2011 results showed significant improvement for both of those companies. In fact, New Jersey, JCP&L, came in first place in the Eastern region and we're going to be collecting one of those J.D. Power trophies in the near future, and we're going to be proud of that. And I want to mention 50% of these surveys were taken after both of these storms hit. So while a small amount of customers can make a lot of noise following an event like this. I think this random survey by J.D. Power shows that when you get down into it, the bulk of our customers, who looked outside, who saw the damage, who saw the trees damaged by the snow, understood that this was a massive effort. And I think we really understood that these storms are -- I mean, I tell Tony, they are 100-year storms. So he's not going to have to worry about them again, hopefully. But they can't be prevented and you can't plan for them. And I've gotten questions at the Board several times about how we're going to increase our storm budget because of them and the answer is no. I mean, they are literally events that I don't think we should plan for. We plan for our normal operations. When they come, we will deal with them.","All right, enough on storms. Take a few minutes to look to the future. On the sales front, we've talked about this. We're projecting a modest growth of 2% across our regulated utility footprint. I mentioned at the beginning, we've got good diversity of load. All 3 customer classes which helps bring balance to this picture. 2% shown here is also adjusted for any offset that comes from the energy efficiency mandates that we have to achieve. ","We're seeing some individual pockets of investment, Tony mentioned a few. You can see a few more on here. This is where the growth is coming from. While some of the industrial load that we had probably disappeared for good, following the 2008 onset of the recession, the ones that -- for the ones that have survived, the forecast is looking a little brighter. Steel and automotive is showing some pick up. There's lots of investment going on in Cleveland, which is the largest city that we serve, and the oil and gas drilling and refining industry is pretty much lined up with our Northern and Western PA service territory and then down on into West Virginia.","When factoring that all in, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial results in '12 and '13. You can see our earnings projections on this slide. Earnings will be stable, and we are keeping our capital programs under control, so as to deliver strong cash flow back to the parent. ","To sum up my comments on the Utilities, I think we really have 5 things that we need to stay focused on. First, company by company, we need to make sure we maintain strong capital structures and earn our allowed rates of return for each one of these companies. We need to use our experiences from these 2 storms to build a more robust storm management process that incorporates all lessons learned from these 2 events. We need a successful completion of our IT integration for the former Allegheny companies, so we can finalize the operational processes and finally run this as one company. And we need to continue to drive more costs out of our business processes while at the same time meeting all of our regulatory commitments. This will ensure that we can deliver these financial results that we've talked about for both '12 and '13 and into the future. ","Mark mentioned to help accomplish this, we're implementing automated work management tools throughout our territory. All of our Ohio operating companies are complete. And we're in the process of implementing in New Jersey as we speak. These tools help us improve the planning and scheduling of the work, and ensure that we are using our crews as productively as possible and the improvements that we expect to get through that are going to help us control these costs into the future. ","Okay. That's it for our Utility operations. I'll shift to Transmission for a few minutes, and then I'll take some questions at the end.","The completion of the merger last year has also brought a significant size and scope when it comes to Transmission. We're now the largest Transmission owner in PJM, and one of the largest in the United States. With more than 24,000 line miles reaching throughout the territory, the Transmission business segment represents a stable but also growing portion of our regulated portfolio. This is another area where the contiguous footprint gives us some operational strength, we can operate our Transmission system with little reliance on any other transmission owners being in the middle. ","Transmission reliability, remains a key to our strategy here, also. Like most of the industry, we benchmark Transmission reliability with a company called SGS. Each year, we set our targets at industry top-decile. And when you look at this chart, you can see that over the last 5 years, we achieved that goal in 2009, and we were in the range each of the other 4 years. Both '10 and '11 were significantly impacted by abnormally high storm years.","Been a lot of significant accomplishments this past year in Transmission also. The TrAIL line was placed in service ahead of schedule when it began carrying load on May 17, 2011. This line represents a milestone not just for FirstEnergy but for the entire transmission industry to complete a 500 kV. 300 mile lines spanning multiple state jurisdictions within 5 years sets a new benchmark for projects of this type. And while I get the pleasure to stand up here and talk about it because it was completed on FirstEnergy's watch, I think it's only fair that I tip my hat to the former Allegheny executive and employees who were really responsible for this tremendous accomplishment.","Along with the TrAIL completion, we moved into the new Transmission Control Center in Fairmont, West Virginia. This facility is a state-of-the-art facility as far as use of technology in the operation of the transmission system. We also completed the move of First Energy's ATSI assets into PJM this summer. While a lengthy process, as we believe this move positions us in an RTO that better fits our overall business objectives and ensures we operate our system in the most reliable fashion.","In order to satisfy a NERC requirement, we decided to employ a laser surveying technology throughout our system to ensure that all load ratings of our transmission facilities were correct and achievable under peak load conditions. This newer technology called LiDAR has helped us identify and correct potential issues on a proactive basis. We also successfully completed 3 separate NERC Reliability Compliance Audits.","One of the things we've worked hard on is to build a find-and-fix culture into our Transmission business with the help of our colleagues from FirstEnergy Nuclear. This questioning attitude, along with corrective action plans, has been extremely helpful in making sure we withstand the external scrutiny that comes with each of these Reliability Compliance Audits.","We also used 2011 to make some structural changes in how we approach the Transmission business from a business perspective. In November, we successfully received FERC approval to use TrAILCo for transmission investments throughout the FirstEnergy footprint. This filing positions us such that any large transmission investments made going forward can be completed within ATSI or TrAILCo, including any PJM RTEP projects within the FirstEnergy footprint.","Building these projects under one of our independent transmission companies ensures that we get clarity on returns and reduces any recovery lag because they will be handled under formula ratemaking. The skill sets acquired from Allegheny on transmission siting and construction will also be invaluable going forward as future projects are completed.","We aren't sure on the reasons for investing in Transmission either. As the future unfolds, coal plant retirements will drive significant Transmission investment. While these units generate energy for end-use, they are also critical components of a reliable transmission network, providing both voltage support and reactive support to the transmission grid. Their retirements will require new electrical components to be added, either new generation or new transmission going forward.","Okay, so what does this mean? We're likely to see increased transmission investment over the next 3 to 5 years. We'll work with PJM through the RTEP process to ensure any investment provides reinforcements well into the future. Some of this RTEP investment will further strengthen the ties between the former FirstEnergy GPU and Allegheny Transmission Systems in order to ensure we can operate the larger system in as most reliable fashion as possible.","We may also look to make some investments to modernize some of the aging components of our transmission system. And one thing I don't see in our future is investing in large scale transmission projects outside of our utility footprint. We plan to stay close to home, make investments that have high certainty of completion and transparency as far as financial returns.","Just like with our Utilities, earnings from our Transmission business segment should be stable over the next couple of years. We're also looking at relatively stable capital requirements in '12 and '13. Several of the Transmission projects that are included in our overall capital plan are shown on this slide. While we strive to invest as much of this capital -- we will strive to invest as much of this capital as possible under ATSI and TrAILCo.","We believe we have positioned our Transmission business as a strong foundation for growth going forward, we've moved -- as we move forward, Mark talked about, we're going to do more structural change with the Transmission holding company to further strengthen how we do this business. Going forward, Transmission investment should provide strong transparent returns, as well as efficient recovery of operating expenses.","And I'm sure you've already done the math, but if you add up the earnings from the Utilities and the Transmission, that puts us in the range of $2.45 to $2.55 in 2012, and we expect to build upon that in 2013. I think our entire Utilities team is focused on financial discipline and operational excellence, as Tony mentioned. So with that, we'd be happy to take any questions.","Unknown Analyst","Is moving the transmission into the regulated company transmission into the transmission segment, is that a precursor or should we think of that as a precursor to a legal transfer of those assets? Or is that not something that you're contemplating?","Charles E. Jones","I think it's something that we would obviously like to do at some point, but I don't think it's imminent. I think we'll get there at some point in the future. It's more just to kind of break the 2 business segments out so we could really see what's being driven from Distribution, what's being driven from Transmission.","Unknown Analyst","Chuck, could you talk to what kind of economic growth assumption is underpinning the 2% sales growth forecast for 2013, and then maybe how weather and growth could interact to have a flattish pro forma sales in '12?","Charles E. Jones","Okay, we'll take the weather one first. We plan for normal weather, we go to great pains to try to figure out what normal weather is, believe me, and I don't think there's any such thing as normal weather anymore. But in most years, you may have a warmer summer and a warmer winter that go together that offset. We haven't gotten off to a good start this year. In our footprint, it's been unseasonably warmer than you would expect in January and February. But over the year, the weather kind of tends to level out. Underpinning the rest, we've got about a 3% to 4% growth in the Industrial segment built in there, about a 1% growth in residential and commercial, that's offset by about a 2% reduction due to all the energy efficiency mandates.","Unknown Analyst","I believe you have mentioned that you plan to earning your return on equity, so you don't expect any new rate cases filing in the future? And when do you expect any -- GAAP between earned and return?","Charles E. Jones","I'd say right now, there are no rate cases imminent. We're earning right around our allowed rates of return in each of the jurisdictions and, I don't see any significant investments that's going to get us to that point in the near future. Our capital program kind of offsets the depreciation that's going on, so we kind of hang right around there with each one of the operating companies.","Unknown Analyst","I noticed that CapEx for Transmission business has gone up in this year's plan versus last year's plan. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going into those numbers, and then what you think the right run rate is going to be for Transmission spending?","Charles E. Jones","You asked Mark earlier, and the main thing that's going into it is the breaking out of the Transmission from the Utility segment. The CapEx that's underneath what was traditional capital is about half of what you see there. And about half of it is due to pulling the Transmission out of the Utilities and showing it within the Transmission business segment. Okay.","Anthony J. Alexander","We are at a break time. It's 9:18. What time do you want us back, Irene? About what? Okay, about 9:32 or 3. Let's make a 15-minute break. Okay. Thank you.","[Break]","Anthony J. Alexander","All right. Why don't we grab our seats if we can. We'll get started again. All right. We're going to get back started here. And our next presenter is Jim Lash, the President of FirstEnergy Generation and our Chief Nuclear Officer. Jim?","James H. Lash","Thank you, Tony. Well, it's a pleasure to have the opportunity to talk to you today. And first, I'm going to start out by giving you a brief overview of our fleet, as well as some of our key focus areas. Next, I'll talk about the impacts of some of the environmental regulations that you've heard about this morning, as well as the recent retirement announcement of some of our coal-fired units. And then finally, I'll discuss some of the capital projects and initiatives that we have to support our goal of optimizing our assets, positioning our generation fleet for growth, as well as upholding our commitment to safe and reliable operation.","As you can see, we have a very large and diverse generation fleet, which is fueled by coal, wind, hydro, gas and oil and nuclear. This fleet is really comprised of 41 different stations and 109 units that are spread across the 6 states in which we operate. I believe this fleet is well positioned, and we believe this fleet is well positioned in the marketplace as a result of our transition to PJM in June of last year. It's clear to me that the synergies gained through the integration of our generation assets and the incorporation of best practices following the merger of last year has really positioned our fleet well for the competitive marketplace. And I believe this is reflected in our 2011 accomplishments.","On the Fossil side, right after the merger we quickly assessed the performance of our new units, we scheduled maintenance outages and we made targeted investments in those units in order to address identified performance shortfalls. These steps enabled us to have this fleet run very strongly during the high-demand summer months as well as the rest of the year, for we're able to reduce our Effective Forced Outage Rate for the fleet by over 50% and to better our year-end target for this reliability indicator.","On the nuclear side, we've also had a strong year in 2011. Davis-Besse was recognized for industry excellence. And the Davis-Besse unit achieved a 0.36% forced loss rate, which is really indicative of top quartile performance. Last year, Davis-Besse in the fall of last year replaced a reactor vessel head. And as you well know, it was during that outage that we discovered cracks in our containment shield building concrete. We performed a very thorough evaluation and assessment of that condition, and we concluded that the shield building was robustly designed, that it was a significantly reinforced structure that could continue to perform its safety function with significant margin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission concurred with our conclusion, and that unit returned to service in early December last year.","We have just completed the root cause, and that root cause has been provided to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission earlier this week and made public yesterday. What we discovered is that these cracks were caused by a significant weather-related event that occurred the year after Davis-Besse went into commercial operation. The report also outlines some actions that we'll take to make sure or to ensure that Davis-Besse shield building continues to function safely. And that will include a plan of weatherproofing coating to the exterior services of that building, as well as performing inspections to make sure that the cracks do not grow, and we will put in place a long-term monitoring plan for that structure going forward.","Beaver Valley station also performed very well in 2011. Those units were also recognized for industry excellence, and the Beaver Valley units achieved a forced loss rate of 0.01%. That represents top decile performance. They were also recognized in 2011 and received the Utility Achievement Award for Best Performance given by the American Nuclear Society. That is the second time in the last 5 years that, that station has received that award.","Last year, I discussed a common approach to safety, human performance and best practices. I'm here today to tell you that I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made in this area. We are leveraging safety and human performance from our nuclear experience across our entire fleet. We have also leveraged the expertise in our generating units to develop maintenance best practices that are now being deployed across the entire fleet. Some examples of that would be our transformer and turbine generator maintenance programs that are being used by both nuclear and fossil. Now we selected these programs because last year, quite honestly, early in the year we had challenges in performance with transformers and turbine generators, and I'm convinced that these programs will help us turn around that performance.","We've also developed outage management guidelines that I consider best practices, and those guidelines focus on safe and efficient execution of our outages. They're particularly focused on determining the proper scope, making sure that we have detailed execution plans in place that we've resourced our outages correctly and that we safely execute them. These guidelines also complement our ability to share resources across our fleet. I spoke of the Davis-Besse outage earlier. We have fossil staff at that outage and that worked out very well for us.","First off, it helps us defer the expenses of contract resources, and it actually results in higher quality work being performed because our personnel are vested in the units. Our integrated generation business plan establishes these focus areas as keys to our success. The actions I just described support the focus areas of safe -- safety, human performance and reliable operations.","Another key focus area for us is the development of the management model, which will result in standardizing our approach and simplifying our daily operations. Examples of some areas covered by the management model are standardized corrective action program, common substation maintenance program and boiler tube failure programs. We have established in our fleet paired teams on both the nuclear and fossil side. These paired teams are charged with the responsibility to identify performance gaps and then close those gaps or use of the management model by employing standardized best practices to address those shortfalls.","This management model should also benefit us as we look forward to other opportunities to improve the material condition of our units, as well as improve the reliability of those units. And moving forward, we will remain focused on the operational and financial targets and maintain a highly skilled and qualified workforce.","As you all know, we recently announced the retirement of 9 units, 9 older coal-fired units as a result of the Environmental Protection Agency's, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule, known as MATS. So let me make it perfectly clear. MATS put these units out of business. And the reason we're shutting them down now, as you've already heard, is that we intend to channel all of our resources towards ensuring that the remainder of our fleet is in compliance with that rule in the timeframe required.","The breakdown of these 9 units, as you can see, is 6 on the competitive side in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland; and 3 units on the regulated side in West Virginia. Currently, we are in discussions with PJM as they review the reliability impacts of these retirements. You can see that through these retirements, we will see a capacity reduction of approximately 3,300 megawatts, which is about 14% of our generation.","In 2011, our output was roughly 106 million megawatt hours, and these retiring units comprised about 10% of that output. By 2013, as you've heard before, we will be nearly 100% low- or non-emitting in terms of our generation fleet. And the breakdown of our fleet at that point will be on a capacity basis above 58% scrubbed coal, 21% nuclear, and 20% gas, hydro, wind and pumped storage.","If we look closer at our competitive units, this slide shows that while our competitive capacity will decrease, we plan to make up for that following the retirements by expecting to make up for that with output from -- by improving the capacity on the remaining units in our fleet. In 2013, the first full year following those retirements, we expect this fleet to generate in an output of 100 million megawatt hours. And as I've stated previously, that will be from sources that are non -- or low- or non-emitting generation sources.","I think this is a slide that I know is very busy, but I know that there's a great deal of interest in. This is -- this shows you what are the impacts and how we're going to deal with MATS on a unit-by-unit basis. First off, I know there's a lot of acronyms on this slide. Those acronyms, you can find them on Page 1 of your Appendix, but I will talk to a couple of them.","The strategy that we're using in complying with the MATS rule involves a least capital approach model. What we're doing is using current emissions, and then stack data -- additional stack data that we will take in the first quarter of this year. And with that information, we plan to deploy numerous low-cost -- lower-cost technologies to ensure compliance. And we're viewing compliance on a plant basis versus a unit basis. We are also exploring co-firing some of our units with natural gas and coal. We'll consider additional dispatch approaches, and we'll even consider derating units considering this marketplace in order to ensure compliance.","Now last year, I told you that our spend -- our capital spend was $2 billion to $3 billion to comply with this rule when it was MACT. Now that we understand the rule and we've dug into it and analyzed the situation more deeply, we are right now looking at a $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion spend to comply. And we continue to work further to reduce that cost. And we will be in compliance by the spring of 2015. To ensure that our plan holds up, we've engaged a well-known independent engineering contractor to validate our approach and make sure that we -- our plan is solid when we start its implementation later this year.","The company is also well positioned regarding the EPA Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. Now as you all know that rule has been put on a stay, which does create some uncertainty. Now our plan for dealing with that rule is not yet fully developed, and it is largely dependent on what we finalize in terms of dealing with MATS later this spring.","This slide should -- shows you that we are -- we will attempt to balance with our environmental spend, capital projects that will also look to improving, where we can, reliability in our units. On the fossil side, we'll change out a rotor at the Bath County's pumped storage -- a generator rotor at the Bath County pumped storage facility. We'll upgrade our turbine rotor at the Fort Martin unit 2 unit with a new turbine rotor, and we will do boiler work at Hatfield and Harrison.","On the nuclear side, we'll replace rotors at Beaver Valley and Perry stations, which will result in roughly a 74-megawatt additional output. We'll replace -- continue to work on replacement of steam generators at Davis-Besse in 2014 and Beaver Valley in 2017. And finally, we'll work to continue license renewal, beginning with Davis-Besse and then wrapping up with the Perry station.","As you can tell, our assets -- as you can tell, FirstEnergy's integration -- integrated fleet has much on its plate in the years ahead. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in solidifying our fleet approach and maximizing our use of best practices across our fleet. The work we've completed, I believe, positions us well to optimize our assets and achieve some growth. And it also improves the effectiveness of the remaining units in order to compensate for those units that we're retiring at the latter part of this year.","In 2012, we will take market conditions into consideration, when we will make smart investments in our nuclear and fossil units. We plan to complete our outages, complete our environmental upgrades, our capacity improvements, and we'll work on license renewal at our nuclear stations. And finally, we will shut down those units that we plan to retire in a safe and orderly manner.","I look forward to leading this integrated fleet to operational excellence, working through the challenges of new regulation and delivering the results that support our company in achieving its financial and operational objectives. Thank you. And with that, I'll take questions.","Unknown Analyst","Can you give a little bit more color in terms of what were the changes in the new assumptions that you're making for the MATS CapEx. What has led to that significant decline? Does it mean more shutdowns or whatever?","James H. Lash","Okay. If you look at that slide, you'll see that what we're really focusing on is improving the efficiency of our electrostatic precipitators and our scrubbers to achieve compliance rather than the use of fabric filters. The estimate I gave you last year made extensive use of fabric filters at all of our supercritical units. And those, as you know, are very expensive pieces of equipment. So what we're doing is upgrading the precipitators and using other technologies to improve their efficiencies, such as dry sorbent injection and activated carbon injection. And if you look at that slide, you'll see that there's now only 2 stations that have new fabric filters, and they are the Hatfield and Harrison stations. And they are not -- the number for those stations is actually 2 fabric filters for Hatfield and 1 for Harrison. So not every unit gets one. So that's what really led to the reduction in our estimates for achieving that.","Unknown Analyst","Great. Follow-up question there. First, with regard to the finalization of the MATS rules, it seems like perhaps some of the particulates and sales went down, so I'm a bit curious maybe from your perspective, to what degree was the final rule different from the draft closing? Did that change this, or what was it more realizing we have an ability to tap our existing ESPs to meet these targets?","James H. Lash","Well, that had -- that was an input of course. The rule was relaxed somewhat in terms of filter ball particulate. So that did help. But I think the greatest reductions were achieved through the technologies that I just talked about, but that was a contributor.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And then maybe a follow-up, and you still talk about a pretty big billion dollar-plus number here. From a timing perspective, I know that's definitely a focus of the industry right now. When would you expect to see the bulk of this CapEx, excluding out '12 '13, is it a '14, '15, '16 that we really should be focusing on here?","James H. Lash","Well, the bulk of the expenditure is in '14 and '15.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And then just a final clarification, you talked derating the units just a little bit, is there an ability to fuel switch here, maybe bringing some PRV. You talked about that a little bit earlier, is that part of the plan?","James H. Lash","Well actually, without getting too much into the details here, the technical details, by using these technologies the we're talking about, we're going to have to remain fairly stable in terms of our fuel mixes because there's -- it reduces some operating margins. And so we will establish a fuel design through [indiscernible]. And then based on that fuel design, we'll work with these technologies to achieve the reductions that we're looking for.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, 2 questions. One, on MATS, can you believe that a plant that burns appellation coal has to install a wet scrubber to be able to comply with MATS, whether it's your plant or any plant?","James H. Lash","I'm not sure I know the answer to that. I may have to call one of my fossil experts to that. But I don't know the answer to that. Charlie, do you have a...","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible] reductions, but that's not a direct side on that. But there is a corresponding substitution roles such as [indiscernible] in general [indiscernible] you have to have that or [indiscernible] injection.","Unknown Analyst","And just follow-up on the fuel switching question. Have you seen, not just for your company but across the industry, a potential shift towards, as more plants get environmental controls, appellation coal plants may be shifting the burn at more Illinois basin. And are there any constraints like rail or other transport constraint that could keep that from happening?","James H. Lash","Well yes, I think from a sulfur standpoint, there is a migration -- or folks are moving to fuel, coal, away from appellation coal. However, the transportation of that coal almost offset some of that. It's a -- the costs are very high. So I really -- I think Donny's going to talk to that. He's going to talk about what our outlook is on fuel cost. Hopefully that will address your question further.","Unknown Analyst","I wanted to sort of touch base on the capacity factor increase in 2012. I know that when you guys were dealing with the merger, you expected to see a substantial increase in the supercritical capacity factor due to dispatch arrangements with PJM. I'm wondering how those went, and how they're being projected in 2012. And also just in general, just -- is it just -- why is the dispatch, why is the capacity factor rising so much in 2012 versus 2011 for scrubbed coal because the capacities if I'm looking at these look about the same. The total megawatt looked about the same. So why is the capacity factor, if I understand this correctly, moving up so much. I'm sorry if I missed that.","James H. Lash","Well the capacity factor in 2011 for some of our units was impacted again, by market prices, and they were placed in reserve. So we ran some -- a number of times we ran with our supercriticals in reserve. We're now looking at hopefully that will not be and replicated this year and that capacity exists there. And we can run those units to achieve that output.","Unknown Analyst","What caused it to do that? I mean just -- I'm sorry to be slow on this, but what is it that changed in terms of 2011 versus 2012 versus this reserve versus it not being that way?","James H. Lash","Market prices were lower, considerably lower.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So that's -- basically it's a dispatch factor. And the arrangement with Allegheny and the supercriticals, has that got anything -- because I know that you guys had thought previously that if you had a must run dispatch agreement that you guys might be able to boost that capacity back to with Allegheny. How did that work that? How is that going so far?","James H. Lash","Donny, do you have a...","Yes, I think that's probably -- Donny's here. Donny, why don't you take care of that?","Donald R. Schneider","It's working out quite well. We have now started to dispatch all of the Allegheny units. In fact, we really did it within a week of the completion of the merger. We started dispatching all of the Allegheny units from our West Akron Campus. And it's amazing me. Within a week, you would do a morning meeting and if you didn't know, you couldn't tell which units were Allegheny units, traditional Allegheny units and which ones were traditional FirstEnergy units. And so we started to implement that same kind of a strategy that we had in our supercritical units. Those units responded quite nicely, and that's fully implemented today.","Unknown Analyst","Could you talk about the PJM process, and in terms of the timing of their reliability determination? And if they do determine that some of the plants that you've proposed to shut down are needed for reliability reasons, what does that imply? Does that imply an RMR contract or does that imply them just imploring you not to shut them what -- sort of what happens then?","James H. Lash","Well as I've already said, we are very early in that process. We have sent in our deactivation letter on the 26th of January of this year. And the PJM has responded with what they see as some reliability challenges, but it has -- but they made no reference to generation assets and what units would be designated as RMR units. So we're very early into that process. We expect to get more clarification in that regard over the next 60 days. And so I really can't answer that anymore specifically today.","Unknown Analyst","Yes. Just one question on the MATS compliance. A lot of the things that you mentioned for some of the plants may have some impact on your O&M cost potentially. Could you give us a sense on what the MATS could do to O&M cost of the overall fleet?","James H. Lash","Actually, I don't have a quantified number for increased O&M cost. There will be some additional O&M cost because there's additional equipment that has to be operated and maintained and monitored. So there is some of that, but I can't tell you what that number would look like today. We have one more.","Irene M. Prezelj ","This will be the last question then.","Unknown Analyst","To the extent that you bid a coal plant with environmental upgrade into the upcoming auction, what are the rules with respect to qualifying to get that to accept whatever price you get in this year's auction for a 3-year period? In other words, should we assume that any of your plants that bid would be entitled to receive the current year auction price for 3 years, or how does that work?","James H. Lash","Well, I'm not the auction expert. I'll refer to Donny on that one.","Donald R. Schneider","The 3-year payment that you're referring to would only be for a new unit going into service, not a unit that you're retrofitting.","Donald R. Schneider","Good morning. I'm Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions. I have responsibility for retail sales, commercial operations, fuel procurement and unit dispatch. Here are the topics that I'll be covering today. FES's target markets remain the same. We continue to focus on these 6 states. However, let me point out one item that has changed since last May. Back then, this map was segmented into 3 categories: home, close to home and market sourced. As a result of our fully implemented and very successful asset-backed sales approach, we now view our sales territory as only 2 categories: generation sourced, which is the majority of our sales; and to a much smaller degree, market sourced.","FirstEnergy Solutions now serves nearly $2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in these 6 states. According to the most recent industry data, FirstEnergy Solutions now ranks #2 in both nonresidential retail sales and in domestic electric-only residential sales. You'll note this slide looks a lot like the one I presented last year. That's because our strategy has not changed. We continue to leverage our generation assets selling the power that we produce in our power plants to our end-use retail customers. Through a multi-channel approach, we have significantly grown our customer base in a truly organic fashion, which we have found to be extremely cost effective.","Let me explain what I mean by organic fashion. While other competitors increase their customer count by acquiring retail sales companies, FirstEnergy Solutions has been able to achieve the same level of growth by utilizing internal resources at a fraction of the cost. As part of our strategy, we continue to focus on reducing our fuel expense to achieve world-class procurement. And we maintain and enhance the efficiency of our plant operations. Let me take a moment to highlight an item that Jim mentioned in his presentation.","While retiring these 6 older coal-fired plants in our competitive fleet was a very difficult decision, the loss of these plants will not negatively impact our channel sales. In fact, it simply means we will utilize the wholesale market to a very minor degree in order to serve our customers when our big machines are on scheduled outages in the spring and in the fall. I'll come back to this point in a few slides.","Our multichannel marketing approach means we go deep and wide in the territories we target. In other words, we pursue every customer class in those markets. We strongly believe that this multichannel approach is far less risky and more profitable than simply relying on one part of the business. This chart lists the 6 states where FirstEnergy Solutions does business and the 5 customer channels that we target: POLR, governmental aggregation, mass market, large C&I, and medium C&I.","You can see we have fully implemented our multichannel approach to securing customers in every channel that's available to us to gain market share and increase our profitability. When it comes to POLR, we continue to be selective. Looking at POLR in Illinois, Amron [ph] procures electricity for customers through the Illinois Power Authority and that is currently not an interesting opportunity to FES. Lastly, in some cases, we are limited by the level of market development. For example, regulators in Pennsylvania and in Maryland have not yet embraced governmental aggregation, which continues to be the most cost-effective method of bringing savings to residential customers. I want to touch on this very quickly. One of the main reasons behind our multichannel approach is to ensure we maintain a balanced customer portfolio to reduce risk. I mean a high proportion of residential customers can result in increased risk with a very spiky load profile.","On the other hand, having only industrial load is precarious in a weak economy. The key takeaway is that having a fairly balanced portfolio, such as the one we've achieved, provides greater stability over the long term and diversifies our risk. It's interesting to note that our current customer portfolio looks a lot like the customer portfolio of a Midwestern utility. That's by design. That's what our machines were built to serve.","This slide indicates our updated 2012 sales position. As you can see, we've included the past 10 months to show that FirstEnergy Solutions does not try to time the market. Instead, we strive to sell and renew our book in a ratable fashion to minimize risk. There are 3 points on this chart that are highlighted. The first, which is at the bottom left indicates our position at last May's analyst meeting. The second large point shows where we are today, and the point at the top right of the chart indicates our goal for the year. Today, we have closed 89% of our channel sales position. I'd also like to point out that we have increased our total expected channel sales for 2012. Last May, the total was 95.7 terawatt hours. Today, we have set a target of 104 terawatt hours.","This slide shows what our 2013 sales position looks like. Similar to the previous slide, it also shows the previous 10 months positions. Today, we've closed 56% of our total channel sales position. As in previous years, our strategy is to have about 90% of our 2013 sales under contract by the end of this year.","Now that we've covered our current state, let's focus on where we expect to be in the next few years. This chart clearly shows that we have successfully held the line on our fuel expense. And we did in fact achieve our targeted fuel cost for 2011. Last May, we projected fossil fuel cost of $28 and $29 for 2012 and 2013. As you can see, our expectations have not changed. Also, nuclear fuel continues to remain relatively flat. By being able to fully leverage our sales channels mix and placing a greater focus on selling to higher-margin customers, we will hold our 2012 rate at $57. And although the wholesale market has dropped over $10 a megawatt hour since May of 2011, our sales forecast for 2013 has only decreased $4 from $59 to $55 a megawatt hour.","Continuing to be successful in a recessed economy is a result of holding fast to our strategy, which has allowed us to effectively mitigate the effects of a weak electric market. I mentioned earlier that the retirement of our older plants was a very difficult decision. I also said that it would not negatively impact our channel sales. To explain my point, I'm going to illustrate our 2013 projections. In 2013, we plan to sell about 112 terawatt hours, while Jim will only produce about 100 terawatt hours from the fleet. To accomplish this level of sales, we will need to purchase a very modest amount of power, 12 terawatt hours. While this volume represents less than 11% of our portfolio, it's important to understand when we buy the power and who we buy the power from.","First, we'll need to purchase only 2 terawatt hours on peak throughout the year. Let me remind you that prior to the last merger, our organization was responsible for purchasing 30 terawatt hours per year to serve POLR load, which has given us a wealth of experience in this area. Next, our long-term purchase contracts make up about 3 terawatt hours. These are legacy contracts such as our wind and OVEC agreements that have been in place for many years and will continue into the future. And lastly, in the past when our supercritical and nuclear units were in outage, our older units were brought online to replace the generation. With the retirement of these older units, we will need to purchase about 7 terawatt hours to cover the scheduled outages. These purchases will occur in the shoulder months, in the spring and in the fall when the price of power is very low. Essentially, we'll take 7 terawatt hours from a weak wholesale market in the shoulder months. And through our retail strategy, we'll sell it profitably to end-use customers.","As I mentioned earlier, being able to fully leverage our channel mix allows us to pull different levers and ultimately improve our profitability. Here, I'm illustrating our capabilities at a high level. But I should also point out that our team has developed the expertise that allows us to analyze our sales channels to pinpoint the most profitable customers. This sophisticated modeling gives us the ability to examine and then target the highest margin customers at the channel level in each utility for every product type and even down to the individual customer. Our enhanced capability to optimize almost profitable channels will be key to our continued success. I'd like to point out government aggregation, which we expect to increase almost 40%. FirstEnergy Solutions is the most experienced governmental aggregation supplier in the marketplace, and we have a proven track record of delivering results. We look forward to continuing to bring that expertise to the rest of Ohio and Illinois. We also look forward to continuing our mass-market effort to build our residential customer base. Consistent with the strategy we laid out in 2009, we've continued to reduce our dependence on POLR sales. You've all heard me say although POLR sales quite frankly are the easiest to participate in, the volumetric swings in that channel make it extremely risky. Over the last several years, the volumetric risk has been primarily a result of customers shopping away from POLR suppliers. This can leave the supplier long in a very soft wholesale market. However, when electric markets recover and I do believe they will recover, companies providing POLR service could experience dramatic volume increases as customers return at very low POLR prices. Here's a real-life example of this situation. In 2006, FirstEnergy Solutions was under contract to serve all of the FE Ohio utility load. When wholesale electric prices increased, one competitive supplier saw an opportunity and dumped about 5 terawatt hours back on the utility. At that time, natural gas was trading at about $10 a decatherm. The electric market was seeing on peak prices approaching $100 per megawatt hour. FirstEnergy solutions contract with those utilities was a full requirements contract and it was at $42 a megawatt hour. Sounds a lot like a POLR contract today in Ohio. When all is said and done relative to the market, we served that load at times at a loss of $58 per megawatt hour. It was a big hit to our margin back in 2006, which makes me wonder if the participants in today's POLR markets are properly hedging and pricing that risk. ","Before I wrap up, I want to touch briefly on a few of our major initiatives that will enable us to continue to drive our strategy. In the retail arena, we will maintain our focus on leveraging the flexibility of our various sales channels, so that we are continually able to obtain the highest margins possible at any given time. FirstEnergy Solutions also understands the significant competitive advantages to introducing new and innovative products. And although I have not talked about our next generation of products, we believe that this capability is important to building our book of business. To maintain our level of success in the retail arena, requires that we sustain a highly effective back-office, which means that we will keep enhancing this area of the business to ensure our competitive edge.","Moving now to our major initiatives regarding fuel. One of our major initiatives involves strategic investments to improve our fuel logistics. For example, our rapid rail delivery system at our Harrison plant, which will greatly improved our flexibility, is expected to be operational in November of this year. In addition, we plan to further leverage our market position and utilize our fuel switching capabilities. I think Jim also mentioned that we're pursuing gas co-firing. Not only will gas co-firing will help improve our environmental compliance but will also introduce competition into the coal supply market. ","Finally, on the heels of our successful mission allowance auction that we held back in December, FirstEnergy Solutions is interested in a second auction when the Casper rules become clearer. Let me close by saying FirstEnergy Solutions continues to be well positioned, to grow our earnings contribution. We have a proven sales team that will maximize our margins, our seasoned fuel and unit dispatch teams have a strong track record of leveraging our position to achieve savings. And as always, our low risk strategic approach will ensure steady, predictable results year after year. ","Thank you, and now I'll take questions.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, I'm just not sure I'm understanding going back to your Slide 11, where you're purchasing only 2 million megawatt hours on peak. I mean, if you're essentially selling half of your intermediate or low following units in Ohio, what assets essentially are you making up for in terms of providing on peak power?","Unknown Executive","That's a great question. I think Jim pointed out, that we look for higher capacity factors out of the supercritical units. He has shown that it will generate about 100 terawatt hours. If you look in the appendix, let me get the appendix, Page 43, you'll see our total sales come up to 112 terawatt hours. So it's simply the difference.","Unknown Analyst","Right. But I mean, if you're going to be under any scenario, you're running your supercritical flat out during peak demand periods. So in theory, I don't see how that would change and give you extra megawatt hours at peak -- on peak. In other words, I could see how it would give you additional megawatt hours to sell, but I don't understand how that adds to your peak portfolio.","Unknown Executive","Well, it really gets into the wholesale sales. If you think about what we've historically done, summer of 2011, July, I think it was the 17th or the 27th was the hottest day in PJM. That was an all-time peak demand. In the peak hour, we were only about 500 megawatts short at that point, but that was only the peak hour. If you looked 2 days later, in that same peak hour, we were long. So when we model 8,760 hours, we look at our portfolio of sales, we compare that out against the generation. And so with great certainty, I can tell you it's only 2 terawatt hours on peak. Any other questions?","Unknown Analyst","You obviously -- you're taking a lot of share away from wholesale and the other pieces of the business in the retail channel. You would the uncertain in AAP's territory and potential maybe to shop more there or at least on an interim basis until there's clarity. How could this mix shift and what customer classes are going to more actively pursue, maybe to further high-grade the mix from once you get these numbers?","Unknown Executive","So Dan, are you asking, is there more beyond the 112?","Unknown Analyst","Well, maybe more about 112 or maybe the mix within these customer classes shifts even further to capture more margin from where you are right now.","Unknown Executive","Yes, that's a great question. Yes, one of the things that we're working really hard on is to understand the most profitable customers and pursue those most profitable customers. You can see how we've achieved some of that channel movement already in one of the slides I've presented. We will obviously continue to do that and we'll pursue those more profitable channels. We're probably capped out at about 112 terawatt hours, but movement within will continue to deliver profitability to the corporation.","Unknown Analyst","Yes. Slide 9, when you were talking about your, I guess it's projections for your fuel cost basically being the same. I was just kind of wondering, what -- is that being driven by hedges and things you'd already put in? Or is that you're kind of looking at the way fuel prices in general have been moving in the last year and that's kind of kept to protection there? Sort of what's I mean the big thing that keep that flat for you?","Unknown Executive","So, we've been working hard, I laid out last May, that we would hold the same kinds of numbers and that we would use our size to leverage the coal suppliers. We've been successful with that. I had a question at the break, with the falloff now in coal prices, is there opportunity to go even lower. And there may be some, but right now we're about 80% hedged for 2013. One more question.","Unknown Analyst","Could you just talk about 2014 and where you would be hedged right now under your strategy and just anything else that you would provide color on for '14 and when you'll provide that guidance?","Unknown Executive","So I'm not going to touch the one about providing guidance but I can tell you from a hedge position, if you just simply look at how we achieved a ratable hedge, and the fact that today, as we look at 2013, we're about 56% hedged, you can take that same kind of extrapolation and you're going to find out that for '14, we would be right on a straight line to be able to get to where we need to be, 90% completely hedged by December of '13.","Leila L. Vespoli","Okay. Now that we got that squared away, I'm Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, here today to provide you with the regulatory update. I am truly proud of the regulatory adeptness demonstrated by my team, and I use the term \"team\" for a particular purpose. And that's because at FirstEnergy, we employ a true team strategy when dealing with regulatory issues. I think that's something that differentiates us from our peers. Legal, rates, governmental affairs, communications, all of which report up to me, really work in a coordinated hand-in-glove manner that allows us to achieve the results we have and in the timeframes we have. For example, the merger with Allegheny, we are able to complete that within a year's timeframe. For our industry, that's near record timing. ","As alluded to earlier in some of our other successes, we completed the integration of ATSI into PJM. In Ohio, we were very active in the Duke ESP case. All right, I will get this coordinated yet. We played a very involved role with getting Duke into a position where are now from both a retailer and a wholesale perspective. They are totally competitive, allowing our competitive arm to come in and serve those customers. We think that was an excellent result in that case. With respect to AAP, we were one of the very few non-signatory parties. We did not believe that, that settlement and that case was good for customers or good for competition, and that is a settlement that the commission recently rejected. But I'll speak more to the AAP, ESP and the continuing sagas in a moment. ","In West Virginia, in the E&E seat case, we were successful, that's essentially their fuel case and that there were no disallowances in that case. In Ohio, Mark mentioned the securities legislation that was passed, that legislation was passed, in fairly short order. It will allow us to -- in all parties actually that avail themselves of the legislation to securitize regulatory assets. Now when I talk about securitization legislation, some of you may recall, Senate Bill 221 actually had provisions for securitization. I call that securitization light, if you will. This is the more robust, full securitization that -- which should allow a AAA rating at some point.","We would expect, sometime in March or April, to file an application taking financing authority under that legislation. Also in Ohio, we had our all-electric case and whether it bumps along the way, I'm pleased to say that there were no write-offs and we are now collecting the $110 million of past deferrals. And finally, some of you may recall, that in Ohio, late last fall, the governor held an energy summit that Tony and I presented at. I would expect some time in the first half of this year the governor would come out with his report and I would expect that report to focus heavily on the shale gas situation.","So you can see from this, we had a full regulatory plate of issues in front of us, and the team delivered results. Okay, now we're coordinated. All right, moving onto what's ahead of us for the next couple of years, what's on the horizon in Ohio. You can expect our utilities, Ohio utilities, to be filing an SSO, that's a standard service offer. It can take the form of either an ESP or an MRO. You can expect to see that filing some time in the fourth quarter, for service of June of 2014. That would mean that we would be expecting a commission PECO decision some time in 2013. The utilities will also be making an energy efficiency filing. That's a 3-year filing commencing in 2013. We are also currently undergoing a renewable energy audit. The commission is going to be hiring an auditor to look at our rec purchases. But given that we've followed both our ESP and the law, I'm expecting a good outcome with respect to that. DPNL, sometime, I guess it is next month, March, should be coming in with their own SSO filing and you'd expect FES to be very active in that case, and to ensure that the Ohio policy of competition is further through that filing. ","Now dealing with the AAP ESP, again the commission threw out the stipulation and I think as the chairman said they pressed the restart button with respect to that. It's actually restarted a little bit sooner than anticipated. On Monday, AAP made a filing, basically requesting that the commission resync certain portions of that decision, and especially with respect to capacity. What they've effectively asked the commission to do is reinstitute the very high capacity prices that they chose or were seeking to charge CRES suppliers, CRES suppliers, FES being one of them. If you think what that does, if you charge your POLR customers a very low price for capacity and charge CRES suppliers a very high price, it makes shopping very difficult because it's very difficult for Donny to come in and compete. That is what essentially led to in that APE ESP the 21%, 31%, 41% shopping levels. It was a variability to charge those very high capacity rates. So obviously, FES will be responding to AAP's filing on Monday. If you think about the dynamics, the likelihood of a success, essentially they're asking the commission to resurrect a portion of the stipulation, a portion of the stipulation that is anticompetitive, that is not good for customers and the rest of the stipulation is null and void, and has been all over the press. So I would say AAPs certainly have a challenging road in front of them in commencing the commission that they should pull back on that aspect of their decision. But on a going forward basis, if you look at it, I will say that there is almost a consensus among all the constituents, that they would like to see AAP get to a place of competitive markets and are willing to work with them through a transition period. I think it's unfortunate that the Duke stipulation came later in time than the AAP situation -- stipulation. I say that because I think that represents a reasonable path forward. I don't know whether that's something that all the parties would be interested in. But if you look at the success that Duke had and the auctions and lowering their customer boost prices by 17%. I think that's something that could serve as a good roadmap going forward.","Moving on to Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Utilities filed default service case for power flow in June of 2013 through May of 2015. The commission also has ongoing -- its Phase 2 investigation seeking to increase participation in retail markets. We actually took pieces and parts from that Phase 2 and embedded them within our default service plan. Those pieces being a 2-year timeframe, and opt-in options, somewhere to an aggregation group, if you would, and a customer referral program. So given that we were somewhat ahead of the curve, we are hopeful that our default service plan will be well received. ","The marginal transmission line lost case if you recall this came out of Pennsylvania. This was a decision by the commission to transform, if you would, transmission line losses, that's what considers them as transmission. The Pennsylvania commission changed them into generation in attempt to get them under the cap. That represents $250 million of pre-tax earnings somewhat less in cash because we started to flow it back. We've obviously appealed that. We appeal that to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which actually last night just denied cert. If you're familiar with the Ohio process, in Ohio, you go up to the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of right. But in Pennsylvania, you have to be asked -- you have to ask the court to hear the case. They actually denied cert -- but this was on a 2-track path. We also filed in federal district court for that case to be looked at. I think we are at very solid ground. The basis of the case, one of the bases of the case is a file background, that something upon which there is substantial precedent, including at the Supreme Court level. So I'm very comfortable with our position, and that federal court case will go forward so that's not the end of the story with respect to that particular issue. And finally in Pennsylvania, with respect to smart meters, we'll be making a filing by June of 2012. You will recall that the Pennsylvania legislation requires for our FirstEnergy in any event 2 million meters to be installed by 2025. And as Chuck alluded to, that's something that we would expect full cost recovery for. ","I should -- I guess mention one more thing, recently in Pennsylvania, the commission published a code of conduct and there's one troubling aspect with respect to that. The rules would contemplate that certain functions can't be shared between the utilities on one hand and the competitive supplier in the other. Those principally being IT, legal and governmental affairs. Now if you think about what that means from a customer standpoint, a utility customer standpoint right now, because they're sharing those costs, they're paying less. So if the commission were to do something where they're essentially going to require duplication, utility customers would end up paying more. We haven't really heard a good reason of why one would want to force this kind of duplication. So I'm thinking this is something that is right for review, and that is going to mean additional costs for utility customers. ","Moving on onto New Jersey. Chuck talked a little bit about the Moorestown investigation, the special master had 25 recommendations. JCP&L has accepted all of them. So I think that is something that as we go forward working with the commission to make sure that we're implementing those and I think that's something that is manageable going forward. We also alluded to Hurricane Irene and that freak October snowstorm. The BPU is going to be hiring an auditor to look at all utilities, not just JCP&L, to look at their response time and to see what lessons learned there can be so we go forward and we have another yet one in a 100-year event that all the utilities will be able to share the best practices among themselves.","The rate counsel have filed a rate challenge, essentially claiming that JCP&L was over-earning to the tune of roughly $90 million. We filed a response to that. The commission set up a process where the board president will be presiding over, what do I call it, kind of an interim proceeding if you would. He will be looking to see whether a rate case is actually necessary. So we're not in a rate case. This is the process whereby we are going to determine whether a rate case is necessary. We're confident that we can demonstrate that it is not and there is no need to drain the resources of both the BPU staff and the company's. ","With respect to the light camp generation situation, just to kind of refresh everybody as to where we are, 3 bids were awarded roughly 1,950 megawatts. That BPU orders establishing that has been challenged by all the EDUs. Certain of the winning bidders are also troubled. They filed notices of dispute. So that process, I have to say, is anything but unclear, as is the light cap 2 situation. Also adding additional complexity, if you would, to the situation, LS Power, the company that was behind the original LCAP legislation, has recently announced that they plan to build generation in New Jersey over 700 megawatts natural powered -- natural gas plants without a subsidy. So the notion of going forward with the LCAP generation thinking it's needed because nobody else is going to come in. It's certainly called into question by LS Power's decision. ","In West Virginia, it's been mentioned, we announced the closure of roughly 660 megawatts of regulated generation actually as part of our ENEC case. We had committed to come in for a resource planning filing sometime before September 1. We will actually be coming in, in fairly short order and possibly in the next couple of weeks to explain the plant closure. It will be an informational filing, but to go through with that commission our rationale behind the closure of those particular units.","You may recall, as part of the merger conditions in West Virginia, we agreed to establish an energy efficiency component. We agreed to 0.5% reduction over a 5-year period and we will be permitted cost recovery of those cost of those programs.","And then finally, with respect to the states in Maryland, their version of light cap is a new generation RFP bids one out, they've come back in. And actually this morning, the commission announced they've taken it down to a shortlist for 1,500 megawatts. My understanding that a lot detail more than that, but apparently that process has moved forward such as that there is now a shortlist of potential winning bidders in that process. In Maryland, we had hearings on the reliability standards. Those hearings were completed in December of '11. If they come out in the form that we believe they will, that was kind of handled through a working group looking at these issues, we think they will be manageable and workable for our utility in Maryland.","And finally, dealing with FERC, there are always transmission cost to allocation issues out there. Recently, the FERCs decided the MVP case from an ATSI perspective that was the case whereby right before we left MISO, MISO approved the wind some project in Michigan. Because we had previously notified MISO that we wanted to exit MISO, we didn't believe it appropriate that those caution apply to us since they were clearly not planning for us. Unfortunately, FERCs disagreed with that and indicated that we would have an obligation, but it's something that was curious to me they set for a hearing whether the MISO tariff actually provided a provision to charge ATSI for that. So in my view, there's a little bit of tension there but I don't believe that's even the end of the story because if you think about it, while we don't believe we're responsible. We were proactive in our ESP in Ohio, that ESP actually allows for the recovery of these costs, so ultimately should it be determined that ATSI is going to be responsible for those costs, we would change -- seek to change the ATSI tariff so as to flow those costs on to customers.","FERC has also an issue with respect to generation asset deployment. MISO is floating a concept called capacity portability. I think that's a euphemism for double counting of capacity. They seek to take the MISO capacity, move it to PJM under very favorable terms. I also think it's on the ironic side, since with MACT, MISO has indicated that they are going to be capacity short and PJM has indicated that they will be just fine. So obviously more to come on that particular issue. ","And the final thing I'd like to mention, with respect to FERC, is the Seneca relicensing process. Seneca is a roughly a 450-megawatt pump storage facility. Its license expires in 2015. We are at FERC seeking relicensing of that plant. The Seneca nation has come into and intervened in that case, claiming that they should have that license and it should be transferred to them. While we take their challenge seriously, they have a very high hurdle in order to overcome to have that license to transfer to them, and we are very confident in the process with respect to that.","So in conclusion, I would say again, in 2012 and going forward, we have a full plate in front of us. But I'm confident that the regulatory team can deliver the favorable results for you that we have in the past. And with that, I'd be happy to take any questions.","Unknown Analyst","Pennsylvania, just passed a pretty constructive regulatory, legislative package that gives the PUC sort of a mandate, broad mandate to be more proactive and now they allow returns to compound on capital investments. Is that a regulatory regime and sort of more potentially profitable regulatory regime given the timeliness that you could get. Is that baked into your capital allocation strategy in this plan or is it fair to say that we might see you guys look more regulated infrastructure investment in Pennsylvania given how that regime has improved relative to other states that you're in?","Leila L. Vespoli","Okay. I want to handle that one way and then maybe defer to Mark or Jim to handle that in another way. As we go through the different jurisdictions and we look at the regulatory structures that are present, we try and anticipate what is on the horizon and try and build that into whatever plan it might be, so be it a typical rate case or an ESP. For example, Chuck, when he was up here early, mentioned the storm riders that we have implemented. So we seek to do that kind of thing, specifically with respect to the particular question in Pennsylvania and whether we are trying to avail ourselves an additional return with respect to, I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at.","Unknown Analyst","Other companies who are operating in the state have said previously that they were not investing the maximum extent they could relative to what they felt was necessary because of regulatory lag, and thus they were promoting the passage of this legislation. Now that, that regulatory lag issue has ostensibly been resolved because of this legislation, is there an opportunity for you to sort of catch-up on spending that you otherwise would've done over a longer period of time, in a better way?","Leila L. Vespoli","I see. Okay, I apologize. I missed your question originally. Because you were talking about the new legislation kind of the disc [ph] legislation, if you would, that would allow for a more immediate recovery of investment. There is a provision within that, that in order to avail yourself of it, you have to go through a rate proceeding. So that's something that as we look going forward, when it is time for us to go through a rate proceeding, after that point in time, we might be availing ourselves of that. I'm sorry, I missed your original question.","Unknown Analyst","Yes. I'm sorry, I just wanted to follow-up, just an Ohio follow-up. I'm surprised there wasn't greater pushback by you in the Duke plan, regarding the $5 or $5.50 a megawatt hour stability charge and just what that means for the dynamic of competitive markets relative to what your positions were in the various AAP dockets?","Leila L. Vespoli","In the Duke case, if you think about it, Duke agreed to retail and wholesale competition immediately. Yes, the charge you were referring to, the stability charge, if you would, that's what people speak to when they're talking about allowing utility to transition. It's essentially an earnings profit, if you would, in the meantime. We don't view that as anticompetitive. There are no shopping caps. Donnie can go down and effectively -- in effect, was the winning bidder. In the auction, the wholesale auction, and he's down there seeking customers on a retail level. So yes, one might want to swallow hard and they're receiving some transition dollars that one could argue whether they are due. I don't think that it's all anticompetitive. If you look at the AP stipulation,  there were shopping caps. There was not wholesale competition. There was a promise of wholesale competition sometime in the future. If they possibly are able to undo their full arrangement. I view the 2 cases as dramatically different.","Mark T. Clark","Very good, Leila, thank you. And everyone here, thanks for joining us again. In case you didn't realize it, I have an immense pride in this team that I have here with us, not only the presenters that you were able to see today, but much of my management team is here today from financial, from sales, from generation, I hope you've had a chance to meet them. They have consistently delivered on their commitments through good times and challenging ones. And as a result, they have helped transformed this company. We are well positioned on every front to deliver on the strategy we have outlined today and to create even greater value for our investors, and I'm confident that we will do exactly that, through our focus on our core business, operational excellence, retail sales growth and financial discipline. We have the right strategy and the right assets to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. ","Thank you. Now let's take some questions. What's on your minds?","Unknown Analyst","This might be a bit more oriented towards Mark. The AE transmission line of credit, what boxes does that essentially represent. Is it trail, the path that it's been suspended, what assets would that entail?","Mark T. Clark","The trail, it's primarily trail at this point. There might be some ancillary costs in there with respect to PATH, and if there's anything else probably with respect to the transmission building itself that we put there, so those would be the 3 kind of primary areas where the bulk of the dollars being represented with the trail line itself and the substations added along that system.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, so there's no intent to put in the bond indenture for potential intermediate transmission hold gold type debt?","Mark T. Clark","They're shaking their heads no, so no.","Unknown Analyst","With regards to ATSI and potentially seeing higher capacity prices, I'm just very curious to hear broader thoughts about receiving RMR and at what point you might receive RMR for some of your units, and also with regards to transmission planning, and when we might see those processes outlined in detail? I know that you guys received a letter from PJM.","Mark T. Clark","Yes, I think Jim kind of outlined that already but we'll work closely with PJM. It's got a letter indicating that they believe that there are significant reliability issues that we're going to have to address. We'll sit down and work with them to try to figure out exactly what are the best ways to go about dealing with the issues PJM has. Remember, we have a responsibility from a reliability standpoint in this region and we will going to -- and we will satisfy that. So we'll work closely with them, work through this. It's going to take time, we all know that. Nothing in our business can be done tomorrow. It takes time, whenever there's capital and whenever there's investment that's likely to be required, like Chuck said in terms of perhaps, some additional transmission into that area. All of that will be factored in and the key to this is enough time for the company to react and to deal with the type of construction issues and citing issues that we may face in order to assure reliable service to our customers.","Unknown Analyst","Tony or Mark, we just looked at the 2012 guidance numbers you've given. The utility should be reasonably well pinned down. You've got 89% of your generation or committed sales already in place. What do you see as kind of driving the variability or potential variability and results this year relative to the $0.30 guidance range right now?","Anthony J. Alexander","The kind of things we always face in this industry, things I don't know. Weather would be one that's obvious. In our space, whether it's good, whether it's bad, it's never normal. So we'll see how that shakes out over the year. Obviously, when I play golf in Akron, Ohio, in February, it's not a good thing. That doesn't happen very often. And so this has been a pretty mild winter thus far for us. Like Chuck said, hopefully it gets made up in the summer. You have weather risks always factoring in, I tell you, assuming in the business like ours, like any business. You have some operational risk with respect to performance of your plants, when do they run, when do -- when are forced off. Those are kind of the larger space things that we look at in terms of, okay, these are things that out there, we know they're there. Our job is to try to manage against it or manage too whatever cards we're faced with. At this point, I'd like to see much more than that. There could be other things out there, there always are, and there's always seems to be something that pops up along the way, but I'd keep my eye on weather and I keep my eye on the operation of the plants. Sales team's doing great right now, they're locking in the sales. The plants are operating well. So we'll see how the rest of it goes.","Unknown Analyst","If you did decide to make Eastlake environmentally compliant, what would the cost be to do that? And then separately, the Ohio securitization of deferred charges, what's the ballpark magnitude to that, that the legislation now allows you to file for?","Anthony J. Alexander","With respect to Eastlake, the decision's been made. It's too much. That's probably the easiest way to put it. With respect to the other one, I don't think we have a handle yet on the magnitude of what we have on our books that will in fact qualify for those securitization. We intend to file I think Leila said, some time in the next several months, I guess, the application, then we'll complete everything that we have to do to make sure that we meet the commission's rules and the intent of the new legislation.","Unknown Analyst","This is probably for Donny. Just a quick question on the hedging. I think in last year's presentation, you had a little more detail around what sort of volumes were contracted but not priced. That slide is absent this year. When we look at the targets you give, how much of those percentages are actually still price-sensitive?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, for 2013, I mentioned we're about 80% hedged out on coal. About 7% of that is price reopeners. The other 13% is open, open.","Unknown Analyst","On the actual power side?","Donald R. Schneider","On the power side, so what's the question on the power side?","Unknown Analyst","Just on the sales channels, I think in last year's presentation, there was a slug of terawatt hours that were contracted but not were indexed priced or still floating with pricing. So when we look at that, close business, I think that may include some pricing volatility and just a quick color on how much that is.","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, very little. The pricing volatility that you saw last year is around our gov bag [ph] contracts that tie to PTC, in the main -- those PTCs have been established, therefore, the gov bag [ph] rates have been established.","Unknown Analyst","Maybe just to play devil's advocate, the comments Leila made on the AAP case, with respect to their filings on capacity not being customer friendly, or competitor friendly, I guess they would probably argue that they had committed their capacity under this FRR, on PJM and thus, they're owed this money. What's the legal, beside the customer and competitive argument, what's the legal argument against that position?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't want to go there. Steve, come on. I'm not a lawyer anymore and I don't think Leila needs to answer legally what our position is going to be. I think she pretty well highlighted for you that we have a problem with the idea of charging capacity prices that are substantially in excess of market because they inhibit the ability of customers to choose and take effective use of the competitive markets to lower their prices and become more competitive and to grow their own businesses. Now that's the fundamental position of the company. And while, like Leila said, with respect to the Duke settlement, we're very comfortable with the fact that customers have the opportunity to shop. That it was the other parts of the transaction were not anticompetitive from the standpoint of customers. That's all we're seeking. To the extent that people try to do things that in fact inhibit the ability of competitive markets to run effectively, then we would oppose that. And we would think capacity charges of $200 plus in a market that's $20, is a tad bit over-the-top.","Unknown Analyst","And one other unrelated question, just on the upcoming RPM auction, of the capacity that you are closing, how much of those cleared in last year's auction? In other words, how much less capacity might you have available that cleared last time for Tony into this auction?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't know. That's getting pretty detailed into the works. I'll let somebody get that to you later, Steve. All right, it looks like that's all the questions. I want to finish on a very high note for you and tell you that this company is focused on operational excellence. It's focused on our investors. It's focused on maintaining our dividend. Now there have been questions today about when we're going to grow it. Well, I think that time is, as the economy improves, as this thing settles down. Otherwise, this dividend is stable. We're working very hard to assure that we can maintain it. We're working very hard to make sure that this -- that we can take advantage of for our investors, for our company and for customers, improvements in the economy, and improvements overall in the competitive market for electricity.

Jones","Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone. Today, for the first time we are reporting earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company. We had a strong first quarter with GAAP earnings of $2.55 per share and operating earnings of $0.67 per share.","Our GAAP earnings benefited from a $1.2 billion gain associated with the deconsolidation of FirstEnergy solutions, all of its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy nuclear operating company. As you know, the FES and FENOC Boards of Directors approved a Chapter 11 filing for these entities on March 31st. The filings do not include FirstEnergy or our distribution, transmission, regulated generation, or Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiaries.","We recognize that these recent events, including FES's announcement that it intends to sell or deactivate two nuclear power plants in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania during the next three years have been challenging for our employees. They are also difficult for the community surrounding these plants that have worked hard to help preserve jobs and the many economic benefits that these generating units provide.","We understand the importance of these plants to the regional economy and recognize that more than $5 million of our utility customers are still exposed to the uncertainty of competitive markets. Therefore, I will continue personally to advocate for regulatory or legislative solutions, including FES' application for an emergency order under the Federal Power Act that recognize the attributes of fuel secure baseload generation and to ensure our customers continue to have a stable, reliable power supply. I continue to believe we are doing long-term damage to our nation's infrastructure, and I intend to be a steady voice in pushing for more integrated policies and decision-making.","Today we're extremely pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle with two ad hoc groups of key FES creditors. The first representing a majority of all outstanding secured and unsecured funded debt at FES and its subsidiaries, and the second including a majority of Bruce Mansfield certificate holders.","The agreement affirms previously announced guarantees and assurances of certain FES employee related obligations, which include unfunded pension and other employee benefits and provides for the waiver of certain intercompany claims held by FirstEnergy. Among them the $500 million secured credit facility, $200 million surety support and the rail settlement guarantee.","It also provides substantial assistance from FirstEnergy on key business matters, while FES and FENOC continue their restructuring process. In addition, other major terms effective at emergence include: full release of all claims against FirstEnergy and related parties; a $225 million cash payment from FirstEnergy which includes a reversal of the $88 million NOL prefiling purchase; a tax note from FirstEnergy up to $628 million due December 31, 2022 bearing interest at the prevailing treasury rate which represents the estimated value of the worthless stock deduction and is designed to trade at the par value of the note when issued; the transfer of the Pleasants Power Station, which is currently owned by Allegheny Energy Supply to FES for the benefit of creditors; and a right of FirstEnergy to share in recoveries after an agreed-upon threshold is met.","The agreement is subject to approval by the Boards of Directors of FirstEnergy, FES and its subsidiaries, FENOC, and Allegheny Energy Supply, the execution of definitive agreements and the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. The ad hoc group also agreed to use its best efforts to have the official committee of the unsecured creditors, as well as any remaining key creditors join the settlement by June 15th. This agreement is a significant step towards FES ultimately emerging from bankruptcy and would settle a key issue in the FES bankruptcy process, so that the creditors may focus their efforts on a restructuring plan.","2018 operating earnings guidance and the long-term growth rate we introduced in February includes the guarantees and assurances that we previously disclosed, as well as other assumptions that fully capture the elements of this agreement. So we are affirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share, as well as our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 68% through 2020 [ph].","I\u2019d also like to be very clear on this next point. We continue to have no plans for additional equity beyond the annual $100 million in investment and employee benefit plans through 2021. In addition, we expect this agreement in principle to be credit positive. We are also introducing a second quarter earnings -- operating earnings guidance range of $0.47 to $0.57 per share.","Let's turn now to our business going forward as a fully regulated utility. In our transmission business, we continue to implement our Energizing the Future investment program. More than 600 projects either underway or in the pipeline for 2018. We are on track to invest $1.1 billion in our transmission system this year consistent with the capital plans we announced in February.","One of these is a $45 million transmission project in McKean County, Pennsylvania that will help maintain service reliability following the retirement of generating plants in the region. The project includes a new 230,000 volt transmission line that extends about 15 miles between existing substations in Bradford and Keating townships, as well as new equipment to help reduce the frequency and duration of power outages. This project, which began late last year, is expected to be completed by mid-May ahead of June 1, 2018 in service deadline.","Another project nearing completion is a new 28 mile 138,000 volt transmission project in Erie and Sandusky counties in Ohio that is needed to maintain service reliability during periods of peak demand. We expect to energize the new line in late May. FERC approved our settlement agreement for JCP&L's transmission rates in February. New rates were effective January 1 and are retroactive to June 1, 2017. This agreement also offers JCP&L the opportunity to file for forward-looking formula rates to be effective in 2020.","The MAIT settlement filed in October remains spending at FERC and we expect the ruling in the second quarter of 2018. In our distribution business, the first quarter weather adjusted load results closely matched our expectations, as Steve will discuss in more detail.","During March, a series of Nor'easters brought high winds and heavy wet snow that caused extensive damage to the eastern portion of our system. Collectively these storms resulted in outages for millions of people in the Northeast. A total of 1.2 million FirstEnergy utility customers experienced outages as a result of these three storm events with our JCP&L and Met-Ed service territories hardest hit.","In New Jersey alone, we replaced nearly 51 miles of wire, more than 750 poles and cleared trees at more than 5,400 locations during the restoration effort for the first two storms. Restoration for those storms involve more than 6,200 line workers, hazard responders and assessors, forestry crews, job dispatchers and electrical contractors. We know being without power is difficult for our customers and we're proud of the efforts by our employees, contractors, and outside utility crews to efficiently and safely make repairs in challenging conditions.","We're working with Utility Commissions in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania to review our preparation and response to the outages. While we're confident that we met our commitments, we work with the Commissions to identify and implement any additional best practices that can help enhance the experience of our customers in these situations.","In total, our utilities spend more than $355 million on restoration efforts during the first quarter, including $250 million in New Jersey and $80 million in Pennsylvania. Approximately $230 million of the total was O&M with all, but $10 million being deferred for future recovery. In Ohio, our application for a $450 million Distribution Platform Modernization plan remains pending at the PUCO. The request of the Commission's approval for this 3-year plan to redesign and modernize portions of our distribution system, which will help our Ohio utilities restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions.","Elsewhere, our plans include a filing midyear for our JCP&L customers under the New Jersey's Infrastructure Investment program and we anticipate a rate case filing in Maryland during the second half of the year.","Now I will turn it over to Steve, who joins us for the first time in his new role as Chief Financial Officer for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments.","Steven E. Strah","Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to join you today. Before we discuss first quarter results, I have a couple of housekeeping items to discuss with regard to our presentation of earnings. First, substantially all of the operations that previously comprised our Competitive Energy Services segment are now presented as discontinued operations in our other -- in our corporate and other segment for both 2018 and 2017, and are excluded from our operating earnings as a special item. This resulted from the deconsolidation of FES and FENOC, the completed sale of AE Supply's gas plants and the pending asset purchase agreements for the sale of Bath County Hydroelectric and Bay Shore plants.","The remaining competitive business activities which were primarily related to AE Supply's Pleasants plan are included in the corporate and other for reporting purposes. As we will discuss later, there was some impact from Pleasants in our first quarter earnings, but we expect its results to be flat for the year.","Second, as we mentioned in February, all of our operating results and projections are being presented on a fully diluted basis. This includes showing the equity issued in January as fully converted or approximately 538 million shares, and excluding the impacts of preferred dividends. We believe this is the best way to provide you with a comparative view of our performance.","Reconciliations for items along with other detailed information about the quarter are available in our consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our Web site. As Chuck mentioned, our first quarter GAAP earnings of $2.55 per share included a $1.2 billion gain from the deconsolidation of FES, its subsidiaries and FENAC. These results compared to a first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share.","On an operating earnings basis, first quarter earnings were $0.67 per share compared to $0.52 in the first quarter of 2017 on a fully diluted basis and reflecting only the continuing operations of our regulated distribution, regulated transmission, and corporate other segments.","In the Distribution segment, operating results increased $0.15 per share primarily as the result of colder weather this year as compared to 2017, the impact of new rates that went into effect in Pennsylvania in late 2017 -- I'm sorry, in late January of 2017, as well as the Ohio DCR.","Heating-degree-days were normal for the first quarter, but 17% higher than the same period of 2017. This drove a 5% increase in total distribution deliveries compared with the first quarter of 2017, including an 8% increase in residential sector and a 3% increase in commercial sales. On a weather adjusted basis, first quarter residential deliveries were down less than 1%, while commercial deliveries were slightly up.","Looking at industrial sales, the positive trend continued for the first quarter with growth of nearly 3% compared to that of last year, driven by the shale gas and steel sectors. This marks the 7th consecutive quarterly increase in industrial sales.","In the Transmission business, first quarter operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base in MAIT and ATSI due to our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program, as well as higher revenues at JCP&L from the FERC settlement that Chuck mentioned earlier.","At our Corporate and Other segment, first quarter results reflect the higher interest expense and the lower tax shield. This was partially offset by higher commodity margin at Pleasants, primarily due to higher wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2018, but as I mentioned earlier, we're expecting its earnings contribution to be neutral for the year as compared to 2017. I will also note that we continue to expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be about 27% -- I\u2019m sorry, 28% for the year.","Finally, we continue to receive questions about our approach to passing tax reform savings to customers, so I'll take a moment to discuss this process. Let me reiterate that for our guidance for 2018 does not include any benefit of taxes. On January 1, we began deferring these amounts as a regulatory liability until we work through the regulatory process in each of our jurisdictions. This is a complex issue that will be addressed uniquely in each regulatory jurisdiction.","We have already implemented the tax change for the DMR and DCR in Ohio where we filed proactively to lower the rate to reflect the impact of tax reform saving customers nearly $40 million. Our Ohio utilities also filed comments that base rate distribution rates are not impacted by the Tax Act changes, because they\u2019re frozen through May of 2024.","In Pennsylvania, we estimate that the combined net annual effect of the tax rate will be about $116 million across our four utilities. Our companies filed comments presenting arguments that single issue rate-making was not appropriate and provided support for implementing a reconcilable rider to be in effect 90 days of the final commission order.","The PUC issued an order making all rates, including rider rates temporary as of March 15, 2018 for six months potentially the earliest date that the PUC would go back for tax savings. JCP&L reduced rates by $28.6 million on April 1, 2018 to reflect the tax rate change. These interim rates are subject to final BPU review and the BPU is expected to make a decision regarding treatment of excess deferred taxes going forward by July 1. JCP&L is seeking authority to continue to defer regulatory liability the impact of tax reform during the BPU proceeding until the next base rate case.","In West Virginia, Mon Power and Potomac Edison will file testimony by May 30, proposing the treatment of tax reform related savings. And in Maryland, while the estimated Tax Act impact would be approximately $7 million to $8 million annually for customers, Potomac Edison will file a base rate case in the third quarter of 2018 where the benefits of tax reform will be realized by customers through a lower rate increase than would be otherwise have been necessary.","On the transmission side, FERC issued a show cause order directing Mon Power, West Penn, and Potomac Edison and 45 others utilities on stated rates to propose revisions to those rates effective March 21, 2018 to reflect the changes in the federal corporate tax rate. JCP&L was not included on the list of stated rate transmission utilities required to file likely because the settlement at JCP&L's recent transmission rate case already took into account and addressed many tax impacts.","ATSI, MAIT, TrAILCo, and PATH with adjust rates as part of the normal annual true-up process. We will continue to work with the regulatory commissions in each of our jurisdictions to determine the appropriate approach for our customers. Thank you for your time. Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fleishman","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones","Hey, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Hi. So just a couple questions on the -- with respect to the agreement, could you give us a sense of -- I think you said majority of creditors, just any more specifics of percent of creditor support and any kind of known opposition that we should anticipate?","Charles E. Jones","Well, I can't give you specifics on the percentages of total creditors. I can tell you this, 100% of the creditors that were in these ad hoc groups have signed on to both agreements. And so there was no opposition within the ad hoc groups and they\u2019ve as I said in my remarks, committed to work with us to get all the other signatories on by June 15.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, great. And then on the -- just on the overall -- I know you mentioned your overall plan is still the same in terms of earnings per share growth and equity. Maybe just a little more color on kind of how your credit metrics look and you said the credit agencies should be positive, any more color on their reaction to this?","Charles E. Jones","Well, we will let them speak for themselves, Steve. But I would tell you this. We\u2019ve reviewed the settlement with both of them, which led to my comments about my belief that it will be credit positive. The metrics themselves are going to evolve as we move through this process. I think that we expect to be well within the guidelines of both -- all of the major rating agencies.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, great. Congratulations.","Charles E. Jones","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead with your -- with Bank Of America. Please go ahead with your questions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning. Congratulations.","Charles E. Jones","Thanks, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes. So, perhaps to follow-up on Steve's question a little bit more precisely, can you comment a little bit on the credit positive nature of this with respect to where exactly pro forma for the settlement, your FFO to debt ends up through the forecast period and how you see this changing versus your prior expectations? It would seem that largely the tax note and the 225 here would be the two key items to watch in terms of the evolution, but let me know your thoughts?","James F. Pearson","Hey Julien, this is Jim. Let me jump in here. When we get out into our planning period post emergence, we see our credit metrics being solidly in the 12% to 13% range, which is well above S&P and the Moody's threshold. So we feel very good about that. On the second point, yes, you're right, we have the $225 million plus the $628 million tax note that we talked about, but that was well within the parameters of our planning period. As you see, the tax note $628 million, that's not due until December 31, 2022, which is essentially financing, which will be at the risk free treasury rate that\u2019s prevailing at the time of emergence, so that will have what I would say a minimal impact on our FFO. So, all in all, it is well within the guidelines of what our plan was and we feel still very confident that we're going to be within that range.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then just with respect to Ohio, New Jersey, you alluded to upcoming infrastructure filings et cetera. How do you feel about being within the range or the distribution CapEx range you talked about earlier, and if you were to get these filings where would that put you, just to kind of make sure we're in the same zip code?","James F. Pearson","If we would get what\u2019s in Ohio and New Jersey, I would suggest that that would probably put us in the upper end.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. Thank you both.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi. Just a quick one first, this date of June 15, is there any particular significance to that as part of the bankruptcy process or is that just a date that you're targeting?","Charles E. Jones","No, it's just a target date. There is no significancy, but clearly this agreement in principle is a major step forward, and hopefully we can get the rest of the creditors onto it also.","Jonathan Arnold","But does the agreement hold if you don\u2019t achieve that by June 15?","Charles E. Jones","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So there's no particular time frame whereby you would have to resolve to keep this agreement intact or is there \u2026?","Charles E. Jones","No.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just separately on that, I wanted to revisit the tax slide, you are saying you haven't included anything in guidance for -- as a benefit from tax reform. Am I right in what you then said that you do have the benefit of the lower tax rate in Ohio where you have the rate freeze, but you consider that to be part of the freeze and therefore it\u2019s not a benefit per se, so you aren't deferring that piece or I just want to make sure I understand that right.","James F. Pearson","Jonathan, we\u2019re deferring everything at this point. So we\u2019re also deferring that in Ohio, and as Steve and Chuck have mentioned earlier, we're not going to make any adjustments to those deferrals until we have what I would say final authorization from all the Commissions.","Jonathan Arnold","So guidance and first quarter earnings then also -- both of those defer the Ohio piece as well as everything else?","James F. Pearson","That's correct.","Charles E. Jones","That\u2019s correct.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thanks for clarifying that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Gregory Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones","Hi, Greg.","Gregory Gordon","So just a couple of follow-ups, pretty thorough questions so far. The $810 million in pension and postretirement and other costs, that number as of your most recent update was closer to $1 billion. I just want to make sure that that\u2019s lower as a function in part of the pension funding exercise you guys did with the -- part of the equity raise earlier this year or are there other aspects of that change that are not associated with that?","James F. Pearson","You know, Greg, I think we\u2019ve always been pretty consistent that the pension and other post employment benefits would be in about [ph] the $800 million range and that that's made up of the pension executive deferred comp, banked vacation as well as a little bit of our long-term incentive program. I think probably -- we also incorporated some guarantees in there, which was about a $140 million, so that gets you right to your $1 billion range.","Gregory Gordon","Okay, my bad. Sorry about that. Second question, as I look at the terms of this deal, new money to the FES creditors is about $225 million, you got the tax note, you\u2019re transferring Pleasants. So other than the opportunity for you guys to participate in the value of the bonds, if they agree ultimately to more than $0.60 on the dollar, this is sort of definitively a clean break with FES with you having some optionality if they get recovery above $0.60, is that a fair summary?","Charles E. Jones","I think that\u2019s a very fair summary. I think you got it figured out.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Hi, how are you doing?","Charles E. Jones","Good, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Greg sort of asked my question. I guess, just to make sure, so after the emergence of bankruptcy, do you expect any ongoing support in terms of employee benefits or anything else to be going to -- for FirstEnergy Corp. to be providing any assistance or cash payments to the generation company?","Charles E. Jones","No. What\u2019s -- the entire arrangement will be done through this settlement process with the creditors and that will be it. We deconsolidated the books on the filing of FES, and we don't intend to provide anymore support to that part of the business, other than we've agreed to provide some shared services support through the restructuring process, some governmental affairs support through the restructuring process. Those all will be reimbursed by FES.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys. Just wanted to clarify on earnings, the 6% to 8% earnings growth, that\u2019s still off of the earnings excluding the DMR, so the -- like 2018, 2.15, is that right?","Charles E. Jones","Correct.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And then secondly, in terms of parent debt. I saw that the parent debt came down a little bit, I think $6.6 billion versus $7 billion, $7.2 billion last release. Just wanted to check is there anything specific that happen at the parent level in terms of deleveraging?","James F. Pearson","No, there isn't, Praful. I know that the parent level when we issued the equity, we took out some of the term notes, but that should've been the extent of it. Our short-term debt probably went up in the range of above $1 billion, may be a little more than that, that\u2019s associated with the $500 million pension contribution we made. Also the revolving credit facility was drawn down by $500 million because FES drew that down and then we had about $300 and some million of storm cost. But I would say that\u2019s what the primary changes are in any type of our consolidated parent debt is.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks. And that level is expected to remain at this level or is there any plan in the near-term to kind of pay it down or borrow further as needed?","James F. Pearson","I would say over the planning period that\u2019s going to stay about in that range.","Praful Mehta","Great. Thanks, guys.","James F. Pearson","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","James F. Pearson","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to just touch based on current level of costs and just as you think about -- I know you\u2019ve been working on cutting costs, but is there any further potential as we think about your cost structure at the parents or otherwise, just what should we be thinking about in terms of initiatives or potential further cuts there?","James F. Pearson","Well, Stephen, I think the way to think about it we started the process of what we call FE Tomorrow about a year-ago. We have been already over the last year implementing changes to the parent in anticipation of this restructuring process. We are going to -- we are not going to disclose dollar for dollar what we're doing here and there. I don't think that that's in our best interest to try to do that. I can just tell this, we're committed to resizing our corporate center to match the operations that we're going to have in a manner that that makes sense that we can give full recovery of those cost as we move forward as a regulated business.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And, Chuck, just at a high level, you\u2019re generally encouraged by sort of the progress that you\u2019ve been making in terms of that cost-cutting efforts?","Charles E. Jones","Yes, I'm very encouraged. And I think we set some targets that I'm confident we are going to meet and I\u2019m also confident we\u2019re going to exceed those targets. You'll see the impact on it as we deliver on the growth rates that we projected.","Stephen Byrd","That's great. And then shifting gears just on the tax note, the $628 million, I know that\u2019s basically sized to equal the cash tax benefit that you're going to realize. But I guess is it fair to say, I guess, your view is you would realize those benefits before the note is due in payables. In other words you will benefit from that cash flow and then ultimately you will need to pay that note off. But it's really designed to think up ultimately, but I would guess maybe some of that cash might come to FE before the maturity of the note, is that fair or how should we think about that?","Charles E. Jones","Yes, Stephen, that\u2019s correct. We could receive those funds prior to that. And the note also allows us to pay that off early without any penalty if we so decided.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, perfect. And then just lastly, just on one element of the agreement in principle, I think there's a provision where FirstEnergy could share in recoveries. I was thinking about to the extent that there is federal support for baseload generation with those kinds of support payments be something that potentially FE could be sharing in or that be excluded?","Charles E. Jones","I would say that that\u2019s potentially something we could share in, but I just wanted to be really clear. We're highly motivated to get support for those generating assets because it would be a mistake for our country for them to close. The communities and employees are -- have the biggest concern there. As of a couple weeks ago, we have no remaining commercial interest in these generating facilities other than potentially what you just referred to in the settlement with creditors. I\u2019m going to keep fighting for support for those plants, because it's the right thing to do. If it gets to the point where it exceeds the threshold that we\u2019ve got in this agreement with creditors, then, yes, we would share some of that, but that's not why we\u2019re doing it.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Congrats on today's announcement. I know it's been little bit of a long road, but you made a lot of progress, so kudos. One question about the new -- a follow-up on the nuclear plants though. Does this mean that the creditor group if the plants actually retire as announced, then FE Corp. doesn't maintain any of the liability associated with the retirement cost, meaning the decommissioning cost, the dry cask storage and that that would all fall to the new owners of the plants?","Charles E. Jones","That's correct.","Michael Lapides","Okay. I appreciate that. One other thing, just looking -- and this is on the distribution business and this is more of a housekeeping item. It look like O&M was up a good bit year-over-year. I don't know if I\u2019m misreading that or is that all stuff that just gets passed through in revenues one for one as well? Just wanted to see and maybe check that.","Jason J. Lisowski","Hey, Michael. This is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. Actually the O&M cost is actually a benefit year-over-year. There was about $0.05 benefit and a lot of that is through the pension OPEB cost being reduced, because of the higher asset return and the contribution made back in January.","Michael Lapides","Got it. I may have misread that, I will follow-up with you guys offline. Once again, congratulations guys.","Charles E. Jones","It's nice to get a distribution question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Yes. Chuck, not being the expert in bankruptcy that you have reluctantly become, Exhibit A in the term sheet that was filed in the 8-K this morning. I just want to make sure my reading of that is correct. All that does is memorialize the Mansfield leaseholders as unsecured creditors of FES to the tune of, what $787 million, no obligation there to FE, correct?","Charles E. Jones","Correct.","Charles Fishman","That's the only question I have. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your questions. Shar, your line is live. Please check if you\u2019re muted.","Shahriar Pourreza","Sorry about that. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just let me ask you -- most of my questions were answered, but on the tax note, there was -- in one of the terms of the draft, there was some language of the tax note can be somewhat mitigated if there is a sale or partial sale of the fossil or nuclear assets. Does that sort of potentially also relate, is there a process in place whether the decommissioning activities could be up for sale and how does that sort of work with the tax note?","James F. Pearson","What that means from that tax note is if they were to, say, sell the plant or deactivate that and FE pays them through the intercompany tax sharing agreement and in turn our work with stock deduction is reduced, that's really what that's intended to mitigate.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, got it. So it's not related to potential sale of the decommissioning activities as you shut the plants down?","James F. Pearson","No.","Shahriar Pourreza","Is there a process in place to sell the decommissioning activities?","Charles E. Jones","You would have to talk to the creditors and FES about that one.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, great. And then, Chuck, let me ask you a distribution question. So as you sort of think about tax reform and I know some of the stuff has been deferred, but as you sort of think about like the accumulated deferred income tax balance that you guys have, have you guys sort of thought about or have you broken out how much of that is sort of protected versus unprotected? And as you sort of think about the unprotected portion, is there an opportunity sort of credit that back sooner than later and potentially look at higher rate base opportunities?","James F. Pearson","I would be lying to you if I said I was an expert in that field, which I\u2019m not. I know we had a question on that before the unprotected piece is relatively insignificant at this point, so we haven't focused much attention on that at this point.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, great. Congrats, guys. My questions were answered. Thanks.","James F. Pearson","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.","Angieszka Storozynski","Thank you. So I have a question on this 6% to 8% EPS CAGR, so that was issued before. You knew how much money you will need to really settle with FES creditors, so now we\u2019ve a sense. So can you give me an idea if there's any potential offset to those incremental costs associated with the settlement? And hence I\u2019m roughly in the same place within that range and if not what is basically driving the difference between the 6% to 8% in that range? Thank you.","Charles E. Jones","So, Angie, when we gave you that 6% to 8% in February, we're already in the middle of discussions with creditors and built into that our assumptions about what the cost to reach an agreement might be. So it's already included in the 6% to 8% and there's no need to adjust for it at this time.","Angieszka Storozynski","So the delta -- so the 6% to 8% is just purely a function of O&M attrition fees and CapEx or maybe low growth as well?","Charles E. Jones","There's no delta to the 6% to 8%.","Angieszka Storozynski","No, no, I understand. What I\u2019m trying to say is what could gave me an 8% EPS CAGR versus a 6% EPS CAGR? What\u2019s the biggest driver here?","Charles E. Jones","More investments such as the distribution platform, modernization in Ohio or the infrastructure investment in New Jersey. More investment would be what would drive us towards the top end.","Angieszka Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Actually, Chuck, I\u2019m going to make your day, I\u2019m going to ask you more questions about the distribution business. Can we go to the appendix please, the slide I think it's 23 where you talk a little bit about Pennsylvania and the slide before that when you talk about Ohio. In Pennsylvania, you've got two utilities that are earning healthy ROEs into utilities that look like they\u2019re under earning. What\u2019s the trajectory and plan to fix the ones that are under earning?","James F. Pearson","Yes, I would say from our standpoint, Michael, what we always do is we look at what our projected capital investments are going to be as well as what load growth or degradation will be and then we'll sit back and make a decision whether we should go in for a filing. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve got a couple of utilities that have a slightly higher ROEs that doesn\u2019t allow us to have the DISC recovery at this point in time. But there is some additional expenditures that are starting to flow through there, that\u2019s going to bring them back down within the -- I think below the 9.5% range or whatever to that. But I would say we universally look at all of our distribution companies, what our plan spend is, what our expected revenues and returns are, and then we make a decision on whether we should go in for a rate proceeding and I think you can see that magnified in what we\u2019re going to do in Maryland. We're planning on making a filing at the latter part of this year and there's -- that's the way we approach it. But just \u2026","Michael Lapides","Got it. And \u2026","James F. Pearson","\u2026 that\u2019s slightly below -- we don\u2019t make a decision to go in immediately and get into what I'd say rate fatigue. We strategically look at what is the optimal timing on when to make those filings.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then a more -- may be more strategic kind of question. We had three or four years in this industry among regulated companies including an announcement made today of M&A occurring where companies are able to cut costs via M&A. Those costs eventually flow back to customers via the rate case process somewhere down the road, makes companies more efficient. Just curious once you get FES result and it looks like it's happening sooner rather than later. How you think about the landscape for M&A and what FirstEnergy's role in that landscape, if any.","Charles E. Jones","So we\u2019re a product of three of those types of events. And I am proud to say that when you benchmark our O&M costs across all of our utilities, they benchmark very well against our competition. I would think that the synergies of those transactions have helped us achieve that. The end result of that is that we have pretty much lower, the lowest rates in the states that we serve. So we\u2019ve given the benefit of those transactions to our customers. I\u2019m a little tentative when you think about M&A type of things today because of the premium cost and the high cost to achieve from a regulatory perspective makes it difficult to deliver dividends to customers in the short-term. I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves now with 6 million customers across five states. That 6% to 8% growth on top of -- an appropriate dividend policy is going to be a good story for our investors for a long time to come.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated, guys.","Charles E. Jones","Okay. Well, thank you for your questions and your time and thank you as always for your support. I think this was an important call for us as we move forward, and we'll talk to you in next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

And welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp.\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may now begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, Manny, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. First, please be reminded that during this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the business of FirstEnergy Corp. are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the consolidated report to the financial community, which was released yesterday and is also available on our website under the Earnings Information link.","Today, we will be referring to operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating earnings per share by segments and adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP financial measures.","Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are contained in the consolidated report. The updated fact book, and as well on the Investor Information section on our website at www.firstenergycorp.com\/ir.","Participating in today\u2019s call are; Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets and Chief Legal Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Chuck Jones ","Thanks, Meghan, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to talk with you today. For today\u2019s call we are deliberately keeping our prepared remarks rather brief, so there will be plenty of time to take your questions at the end.","Clearly the topic many of you will be most interested in is our 2015 earnings guidance, which we made public late last evening. But before moving to that discussion, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Tony Alexander for his leadership of FirstEnergy over the past decade. Tony guided our Company through a dramatic expansion and navigated through one of the most challenging periods in the history of the utility industry. As you know, we also announced last night that Tony\u2019s last day will be April 30th and we certainly wish him well as he begins his new chapter in his life and enjoys more time with his family.","Since moving into the CEO position on January 1, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to either meet personally or talk with many of you over the telephone. We\u2019ve had some good two way conversation over the past couple of months. And I want you to know that the entire FirstEnergy team is committed to providing frank and open discussion about the challenges and opportunities we are facing as a company, that\u2019s why in light of the recent Pennsylvania rate case settlements we decided to provide you with our earnings guidance range earlier than originally planned, so you would have a clear sense of what we are expecting this year.","The 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share is in line with the updated drivers for our utilities business and corporate segment that we provided in November, although some street expectations have not been adjusted to reflect that information.","Looking at consensus estimates, we saw a fairly widespread of about $0.50 ranging from $2.60 to over $3.10 and we understand the challenges of modelling FirstEnergy giving all the moving pieces we have right now.","Given the disparity between the street consensus and our 2015 base earnings, we believe it\u2019s very critical to ground the investment community on earnings sooner rather than later as we reset our utilities around the new growth strategy.","After today, our focus shifts to customer service driven growth across the utility segment. In that light now that we have made our 2015 earnings guidance public, following this call Irene and her investor relations team will be happy to answer your detailed questions about all the disclosures we made yesterday and today including here in our consolidated report and in our updated fact book.","In the future once all of the pending rate case proceedings are finalized modelling are going forward earnings power should be far more transparent. And we hope to better articulate that for you later this year during the analyst meeting where we expect to provide a growth target for our utilities as well as in overall strategic update on all three of our business segments. We continue to believe the initiatives that were put in place during 2014 laid the path for our future growth and success. So let\u2019s several minutes to review the key events of the past year.","We successfully launched our Energizing the Future of transmission expansion program. Under this program, we will invest billions of dollars with an eye towards serving our customers better. These investments will improve reliability, add resiliency to the bulk electric system and install enhanced physical and cyber security to ensure our assets perform as designed.","With our multiple rate proceedings, we have also set the stage for similar investment in our regulated businesses and more timely recovery of those investments. The recent major storm events that have impacted FirstEnergy service territory have highlighted the need for hardening of our distribution systems. And of course in the wake of the polar vortex and other severe weather events last winter we began taking a far more conservative approach in our competitive business to limit risk and -- focus on greater stability.","We have made good progress on these efforts. Our West Virginia rate case settlement was approved by the state public service commission earlier this month and we have filed settlements in our Pennsylvania and Ohio rate proceedings that require regulatory approval. We also look forward to closure on the base rate case at JCP&L and remain hopeful that the board of public utilities final decision in that proceeding will appropriately include the $580 million incurred by JCP&L for the 2012 storms.","Once that case is finalized we look forward to working with the BPU to make Jersey Central Power & Light a stronger company going forward. In our ATSI proceeding, we believe FERC\u2019s approval of our request to move to forward looking rates as of January 1 signals support for transmission investments for grid reliability.","As we anticipated FERC accepted it subject to refund and also set hearing and settlement procedures and initiated an inquiry into ATSI\u2019s return on equity. We believe that more timely recovery associated with forward looking rates is a major benefit to us which outweighs the impact of a potentially modest ROE adjustment. This rate structure for ATSI will provide a much better co-relation to our cost as we continue to implement our Energizing the Future of transmission investment plan.","That plan is comprised primarily of thousands of small, customer focus transmission projects and equipment upgrades that can be implemented relatively quickly across our existing 24,000 miles of transmission assets. These projects are designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency for our customers while providing long term and sustainable growth for FirstEnergy.","I strongly believe that the right investments are those that customers value and are willing to pay for and that provide attractive returns for our investors. It\u2019s gratifying to report on the successful first year of that program. We overcame some weather related setbacks early in the year but by December we successfully completed our plan of $1.4 billion in new investments spanning more than 1100 projects. You can see the impact that that investment when you look at our financial disclosures for the transmission segment.","The plan for 2015 calls for an additional $970 million investment across 430 projects including 1000 pieces of substation equipment and 300 miles of transmission lines. By the end of this year we expect to be well on track to meet our four year goal of $4.2 billion in investments through 2017.","Key projects for 2015 include construction of a new substation and transmission line near Clarksburg, West Virginia to support an existing gas processing plant and reinforce the regional grid.","We are also planning construction of a new transmission substation near Burgettstown town, Pennsylvania that will support low growth and improve service reliability for more than 40,000 customers of West Penn Power.","At the EEI conference last November, we told you that we have identified about $15 billion in incremental transmission projects in 2018 and beyond providing a path to both improved customer service and a long term and sustainable growth platform for our company.","Lets shift gears now and look at our competitive business. The actions we continue to take with regard to our more conservative strategy have been very effective at reducing the overall risk in this business. While our open position is subject to market movement we are structuring the business to be more predictable and self sustaining.","Our conservative approach will better protect us in the event of extreme weather or unplanned outages at a major generating facility. We are projecting this business to be cash flow positive each year over the 2015 to 2018 period using conservative assumptions. I\u2019ve been asked numerous times about the possibility of divesting this business, frankly at this point in time it doesn\u2019t make sense while we are at or hopefully near the bottom of the market to sell these assets at the lowest value they will likely ever have.","In addition, capacity market reforms and pending changes to the treatment of demand or response are likely to provide near term value for this business. Once these moving pieces play out we should have a much better picture of what we can expect from our competitive business going forward, at this point it remains a core business for FirstEnergy. However, we continue to monitor closely the financial performance of some of our individual generating units, particularly those located in western PJM. While the low market revenues are build into our financial models several of our units continue to struggle to run economically.","The strategies we have in place in all three of our business segments are sound. They are the right priorities for our company at this time and in this environment and we will continue to refine them as conditions require or opportunities emerge. Along the way we intend to provide clear communication about our challenges, opportunities, strategies and goals. I\u2019m sure you will have many questions at the end of this call and we have full investor meeting schedule coming up. I will make myself available as often as necessary to ensure we address all of your questions. I also hope to get to know many of you more in the next several months.","For those of you who are not yet familiar with my style, I was trained in as an engineer to solve problems. My career FirstEnergy has been focused on customers and looking for sound long term solutions.","Our distribution and transmission businesses have been my main focus, although I did have the opportunity to oversee our competitive business for the couple of years as well.","As I mentioned earlier, in my mind the best investments like the ones we\u2019re making in our transmission business are those that provide both customers and shareholders with real value.","Its our responsibility to provide customer with a safe, reliable, affordable and clean electricity and my philosophy is that a commitment to these principals reflected in both our decision making and our management style is good business.","Lastly, I believe very strongly in transparent communications whether to employees, customers, regulators or the financial community that mean saying what we know, when we know it. That\u2019s why we decide to write earnings guidance sooner than originally expected.","Looking forward, we will remain focused on long term shareholder value, executing our regulated growth plans and taking a conservative approach to our competitive business. At the same time, we will continue to evolving [ph] to meet the needs of our customers who rely on electricity to power their businesses in everyday lives.","It\u2019s my priority to move FirstEnergy to its next period of growth and success benefiting our customers, employees and investors.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a short review of 2014 financial results and additional details on our earnings guidance. Following Jim\u2019s remarks we\u2019ll open the call to your questions and we should have ample time to address whatever you\u2019d like to talk about.","Jim Pearson","Thanks, Chuck and good morning everyone. This morning we\u2019ve reported 2014 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share and full year operating earnings of $2.56 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range.","It was a strong quarter and solid year overall with numerous achievements. In somewhat of a change to past practice I won\u2019t cover the results for the quarter in detail by segment since that information is available in the consolidated report or from our IR team.","Instead, I will speak to the major drivers and events while leaving more time for Q&A. For the fourth quarter of 2014 GAAP results were in loss of $0.73 per share. This includes special items of $1.53 per share of which $1.23 is related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment and as a non-cash item.","This adjustment primarily reflects a 75 basis points decline in the discount rate and revise mortality assumptions used to measure our obligation.","Moving now to our fourth quarter operating earnings drivers, consistent with the guidance we provided at EEI November, the FirstEnergy consolidated effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 predominantly reflecting a tax benefit associated with the resolution of state tax position.","This drew a quarter-over-quarter benefit of $0.12 per share of which $0.10 was included in the corporate segment. And our regulated utilities overall distribution deliveries decreased fourth quarter earnings $0.01 per share.","Total deliveries were down slightly primarily driven by milder weather which drove a 2.5% reduction in residential sales quarter-over-quarter. Industrial sales were up 1.8%, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in that sector.","On the transmission side we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.14 per share in line with our expectations as we ramped up our Energizing the Future initiative.","At our competitive operations results came in slightly better than expected for the quarter. Commodity margin was down $0.08 per share primarily due to lower contract sales that resulted from the change in retail strategy as well as mild weather. These factors were partially offset by higher capacity revenues related to the increase in the auction clearing prices.","Let\u2019s move to a short overview of some of the key earnings drivers for 2014 which included a 6% earnings improvement in our transmission segment year-over-year as we launched our Energizing the Future Initiatives.","On a competitive side of the business we experienced a year-over-year earnings decline of $0.51 per share due to the extreme weather events early in 2014, partially offset by the actions we put into place to reposition our sales portfolio and effectively hedge our generation by reducing weather sensitive loads.","Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million in line with our expectations. At our regulated distribution utilities we\u2019ve reported 2014 operating earnings of $1.93 per share in line with the midpoint of guidance we provided in November.","We saw the full benefit of the West Virginia asset transfer but also rising expenses for maintenance, depreciation, general taxes and interest without commensurate recovery in rates. However, as Chuck said, new rates that we expect to be effective in 2015 will reset the base line for a majority of our utilities.","Distribution deliveries increased 1% compared to 2013 on both on actual and weather adjusted basis. Industrial sales were up each quarter and ended the year up 2%.","At our corporate segment we benefited from multiple tax initiatives and ended the year with an effective income tax rate of 29.3%. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 37% to 38% in 2015.","Let\u2019s now move to a discussion of some of the 2015 operating earnings guidance details. On the regulated utility side which is where we believe most estimates did not fully account for the increases in ongoing expenses such as depreciation, interest and taxes, we expect a midpoint of $1.82 per share.","This includes new rigs in West Virginia which will effective this month and our expectation for new rates in Pennsylvania which would be effective in May based on the pending settlement.","For New Jersey, we assumed revenues neutral to 2014 levels but included $0.08 per share for amortization of deferred storm cost for both 2011 and 2012 storms. We expect moderate low growth in distribution sales of about 1%.","Commodity margin at our competitive operations is expected to increase by $0.44 per share in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher ATSI capacity prices.","For 2015, our committed sales currently are 67 million megawatt hours. Our 2015 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business has been revised to $875 million to $950 million, a slight decrease from our previous range given the drop in power prices since November.","At our transmission segment, this year we expect an uplift of $0.11 per share related to the implementation of forward-looking formula rates as requested in our FERC filing and high rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL.","An although FERC has initiated an enquiry related to our ATSI, ROE we anticipate the range for that segment should accommodate the outcome of that process. At corporate a combination of a more normal effective tax rate coupled with increase net financing cost is expected to reduce 2015 operating earnings by $0.42 per share in line with the drivers we provided at the EEI.","Last evening, we published detailed information regarding our 2015 guidance on our fact book, which is posted on our website.","With that, I\u2019d like open the call for you questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. We would now\u2026","Jim Pearson","Okay. As promised we have 35 minutes left for questions.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our first question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Neel Mitra","Hi. Good morning.","Jim Pearson","Good morning, Neel.","Neel Mitra","Jim, I had a question on the O&M expense at the regulated utilities, so it seems to go up $0.08 in 2015 and then in your drivers in 2016, it looks like its flat. Was just wondering what\u2019s causing the increase in 2015 and maybe what\u2019s the normalized run rate on a percentage basis for increases going forward?","Jim Pearson","Going forward, Neel, I would say our O&M is going to be pretty much consistent with what we\u2019re reflecting in 2015. In 2015, we\u2019re seeing some additional O&M expenses associated with some of our rate filings and vegetation management mostly. That would be the primary driver.","Chuck Jones","And vegetation management are big piece of it, in light of the major storms that we saw, we been spending a lot of money reclaiming our rights of ways and expanding our rights of ways which has been capital expense and we\u2019re going to be shifting more into more typically four year trim cycle which is going to shift some of that back to O&M.","Neel Mitra","Right. So in 2016, it looks it shows its kind of neutral, as I mean you expected to be flat or do you expect kind of a consistent percentage increases as 2014 or 2015 between 2015 and 2016?","Jim Pearson","No. In 2016 Neel we would expect that O&M to be flat to 2015.","Neel Mitra","Okay, great. And then, is there any kind of update on the timing of the higher PPAs as far as when we get a decision and whether that would be before RPM?","Leila Vespoli","Hi, Neel, this is Leila. Yes. So the procedural schedule slipped in Ohio little bit. We may have FirstEnergy supplemental testimony being due in March 2 as well as intervener testimony and Staff testimony on March 27 and hearings on April 13. Given that we\u2019ve asked for \u2013 originally asked for an April 8 decision date, obviously that is not going to happen. But from our standpoint I still think we\u2019re in a good place. Originally we had asked for April 8 date to commit two things.","If you think about it from an FES perspective, FES needs to know to whether they have this generation and how to hedge it. So we need a reasonable period of time to allow FES to be put in to position to sell it.","And also with regard to the RMP auction. I think given the schedule the way it is now we\u2019re FES is going to have to bid those units in along with the rest of the competitive generation and it just kind of a missed opportunity for the utility side to do that. But again I don\u2019t think a critical thing. it just would have been a nice to have kind of thing.","So that\u2019s \u2013 it was respect to the schedule for us. As you may AEP has a case dealing with the PPA coming up, I understand decision will probably come out in the next two to three weeks or so and I\u2019m hopeful that will bode well for decision in our case.","Neel Mitra","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. the next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning guys. Chuck, I think Jim hit it well that you prior lot of us in the industry were surprised by some the expense lines of the utility, if you look at the earned ROEs for the jurisdictions how do you think those ROEs look in 2015 versus what you expect going forward meaning, are you going to see improvement in ROEs beyond this year, or we normalized at this ROE level?","Chuck Jones ","Well, Dan, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say, obviously I think given fiscal policy in our country there is going to continue to be pressure on ROEs as long as interest rates stay low. But absent regulatory action on our part I don\u2019t see any way that those are going to change. So once we get through Pennsylvania, we\u2019ll figure out where we end up with ATSI and we get through New Jersey.","I think we\u2019re going to be in a pretty stable place there and I expect later this year when we do an Analyst Meeting that we\u2019ll be able to give you little more transparency into what those ROEs are company by company other than we kind of did the rate making and kind of a black box type environment. So hopefully we\u2019ll give you more clarity on that later this summer.","Dan Eggers","Can I maybe ask that little clumsier than I meant to. From an earned ROE perspective, if you look at the different utilities and particularly with your rate cases having gotten resolved, should the earned realized ROEs kind of level out at where you are expecting in 2015 guidance or do you look at things in 2016 and 2017 that could allow ROEs to improve?","Jim Pearson","I would think they\u2019re going to certainly level out at where we\u2019re at in 2015 and I expect overtime there will be some modest improvement.","Dan Eggers","Okay, and I guess here Jim on the operating expenses you know being higher on the utilities something that you expected the Pension\/OPEB in depreciation expenses seem to stand out from our math, can you just talk about what was underlying in some of those increases year-on-year and how we should think about those going forward?","Jim Pearson","Yes let me start with the Pension\/OPEB line Dan, that\u2019s primarily driven by the absence of a credit that is expiring over the 2014, 2015 timeframe. And then you have slightly higher pension expense associated with the mortality tables. So that\u2019s what drove the reduction in that line. From a increase in what I would say the depreciation and property taxes when I look at distribution that\u2019s pretty consistent year-over-year and if you look at 2013 to 2014 depreciation property taxes increased about $0.09 were showing about an $0.08 increase 2015 to 2016.","And when you think about it, we\u2019re spending about $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion annually at our distribution company and we have about $650 million of depreciation, so we\u2019re spending more in our depreciation there so. I would look for that type of a consistent increase in depreciation and property taxes.","From the transmission side, we showed a increase in depreciation property taxes of about $0.03 2013 to 2014 and that was showing the ramp up of our Energizing the future program. We spent $1.4 billion in capital; in 2014 we are expecting to spend just about $1 billion in 2015. So that $0.11 increase in property tax is really associated with that increased capital and essentially the timing of when it goes into service.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Just one last question just on the transmission side with the CapEx down this year versus last year, I know that was part of the plan you laid out in the fall but because you have a lot of smaller projects what could motivate you guys that allow the opportunity fee you spend more money in 2015 than you\u2019ve budgeted so far?","Chuck Jones ","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to spend more money in 2015 than we budgeted, so wouldn\u2019t want to leave you with that impression. You know one of the critical aspects of that plan quite frankly is getting the workforce to be able to construct these projects and there is a constraint on that across our nation, but we have locked in through a partnership with Quanta workforce that will be available to FirstEnergy well into the future and I think that it makes sense to just approach this in a kind of steady predictable fashion. The drop off from 2014 to 2015 is due to the fact that we had a number of reliability projects that PJM ordered as a result of the late plant closings that were finishing up and putting in service early this year.","Dan Eggers","Great. thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning, sorry about that. Can you hear me?","Chuck Jones ","Yes, we can hear you Paul.","Paul Patterson","On the $0.30 per transmission that you guys are projecting for 2015, how much of that is in the [Indiscernible] Forward treatment that you guys are expecting? And just on that for a quarter, as I recall my understanding was that they really hadn\u2019t signed off on the Ford test-years treatment. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I know the settlement discussions must be encouraged and I think they are still going on, can you give us any flavour for that as well in this context of the Forward test-year stuff?","Leila Vespoli","This is Leila, I\u2019ll answer the latter part of the question first and then turn it back over to Jim. So you are correct, we are in the settlement of process associate with that, there has been no set procedural schedule although if thing stay inline you might expect that decision in that case maybe late this year or slipping into the first quarter of the following year. With regard to the rate they have not left the forward looking tester, what they did is put the rate into effect subject to refund. So January 1st we started it and I think the refund date was something like the 12th or 13th of January. So that\u2019s where it stands from a procedural schedule standpoint.","Jim Pearson","And Paul to your first question that $0.30 uptick in revenues there, the majority of that would be associated with actually in the forward-looking test year.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But you guys feels confident I guess I mean with respect to your settlement discussions and what have you about the forward test year treatment is that Leila that fair enough to say?","Leila Vespoli","I think if you look at past President at FERC I think the forward-looking test year part of it even though that is an issue that the party is raised is something that you know from my standpoint I feel very comfortable on, I mean some of the other things they are looking at you know \u2013 Interveners allege is you know -- finding the system. They are also looking at the protocols for true up. So from my standpoint officially given how Chuck described what it is we\u2019re doing and the reliability aspects of this I feel very comfortable where we are. The one thing we have always highlighted is the rate of return and the fact that we thought that that would be an issue and not withstanding that we felt that appropriate to go in with the formula rate. If you want to think about it every 100 basis points is about $16 million and so you know if you then look at past President you can do your own calculation with regard to that.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great.","Jim Pearson","Paul, I just want to point out, I\u2019m sure you understand this, but because the 2014 expenditures were you know lagging rate mechanism and now the 2015 expenditures are in a forward-looking mechanism what you are seeing in terms of the shift in earnings from 2014 to 2015 really is two years worth of expenditures. So that\u2019s not the number that you are going to expect to see going forward.","Paul Patterson","Great. Thanks for the clarity guys. And then Chuck you mentioned in your remarks that you wanted I believe the merchant business to be more self sustaining and also that your thoughts of the market was at a very low price and \u2013 power prices and what have you in that it just being the wrong time to divest the business if that were the case. And I guess the question that I have is A, if your market outlook changed would you be willing to perhaps look at breaking off these companies if it were possible?","And then just B, what\u2019s your appetite for additional investments perhaps and merchants just and in general how do you see the merchant arm of this business which is clearly very different than the rest of the business, how do you see that strategically going forward, do you see a possibility of a spin off or just in general how should we think about how you are really looking at this business and what you might do strategically to enhance value?","Chuck Jones ","So here\u2019s how I am thinking about it. And I have told several others who \u2013 asked this question, I wanted to long time ago never say never and never say always. So, things can change, but for now we\u2019re looking at running that business in a mode where we remain cash flow positive where we used those market changes that are coming to take that cash and begin retiring some of the holding company debt that\u2019s associated with that business and overtime put that business into a position where we can have more flexibility and how we look at it.","And then if you can tell me what the market\u2019s going to be like in two years, three years, four years, I think I could answer what I would do depending on what that market\u2019s like. But I don\u2019t think anybody can tell us what that\u2019s going to be. So right now we\u2019re hedged down, we\u2019re committed to running a cash flow positive and we are committed to de-risking it so that it doesn\u2019t continue to be the conversation when 80% of our company is regulated and generating absent [ph] today and getting everybody kind of in line with where we are at, generating consistent predictable regulated earnings, so that\u2019s the plan.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks so much.","Jim Pearson","Hey Manny, before we go move forward, I intended [ph] to know when I was giving Dan an explanation on the increase as of depreciation year-over-year I said it increased 2016 versus 2015 I should have said 2015 versus 2014.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I wanted to go back again to the distribution earnings, I mean we are clearly missing a piece here, so you\u2019ve just gone to rate cases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and West Virginia. You know what if your cost structure going into these rate cases, you showed us what is the pre-tax impact of the rate case settlement or decisions and yet we have all of this $0.25 plus drag from higher cost on the distribution side, shouldn\u2019t that have been already reflected in the rate cases that you have gone through and also is this just an attempt to basically reset the base for future growth of this business and have fetched us just incremental on them [ph] spending that basically is not recurring?","Jim Pearson","Angie, yes this is Jim. Some of the expenses that we had incurred was to prepare us for these rate filings that we had. As I said earlier we would expect that our O&M is going to held flat going into next year and we will be realizing the full impact of all of those rate filings next year. As Chuck said earlier, I would look at 2015 as our base line that we are going to start growing those distribution earnings from that point and you know we\u2019ll be said that provide more clarity on that at the analyst day meeting that we have.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, but can you please give us a sense of this growth that other regulated utilities can offer. I mean is this a meaningful step up starting in 2016 for distribution?","Jim Pearson","For this point we are not giving any type of 2016 guidance but you know this is the base line that we would expect to start showing growth at our distribution utilities. I don\u2019t think we are going to put a percent out there yet until we fully understand what\u2019s reflected in all of the regulatory outcomes and that we\u2019re comfortable and confident that we\u2019ll be able to deliver on that.","Chuck Jones","We\u2019re got some work to do here, we have a settlement but it hasn\u2019t been approved by the PA regulators, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for us to assume that we still got work to do in New Jersey and obviously we have a big case pending in Ohio. Once all that settles out then I think we are in a better position to decide what\u2019s our investment strategy going forward, what\u2019s our plan for each of those states going forward and that\u2019s what we plan to tell you later this year once we get all those answers.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning.","Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to just follow up I think really on Paul\u2019s question on the sort of market outlook, you all are fairly physically close to a lot of the shale gas activity and we\u2019re seeing a lot of development of shale gas. I was \u2013 just have a high level interested in your market take in terms of what the growth in shale gas really means longer term for power prices, what\u2019s your expectations, it sounds like from Chuck\u2019s earlier comments that you are relatively bullish on power prices relative to the four, I was just curious how you think about the dynamics from the shale gas that we are seeing being developed right around in your territory?","Jim Pearson","Well first of all I\u2019m not sure what I said to make you think I was bullish on forward curve power freight [ph], because that\u2019s quite to the contrary. I think as we look at the shale gas issue we have to look at it in a couple of different ways. The first way is on those forward price curves and we actually had IHS in yesterday to talk to us about their views. And I think you know for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re not expecting any significant uptick in those forward price curves, so we are structuring our competitive business around those forwards as we know.","The other side of that coin is it\u2019s the economic development engine that\u2019s driving growth in our territory and over the next few years we expect to connect over a 1000 megawatts of new load directly attributed to the midstream part of that business, you know there are discussions underway about upto three cracker plants in our region, if any or all of those come to fruition I think those are the foundation for an industrial revolution in the part of the country that we serve.","So that\u2019s the upside long term, the reality in short term is we expect gas prices to stay fairly low. There is some congestion in the gas markets that\u2019s going on right now, but there is also roughly $20 billion worth of gas transmission projects that are under construction and expected to go in service over the next few years that will release some of that congestion and eliminate some of the basis difference between our zone and the rest of the country. And that might have a modest change but all in all we are planning to run our regulated business around the market forward as we see them today.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. And just wanted to touch base on your hedging strategy given that they are repaying [ph] your seen in the market any changes in terms of your thinking in terms of the volume that you\u2019d like to hedge or given what you said about sort of your market outlook, any changes we should expect in terms of how you all think about hedging your generation fleet going forward?","Chuck Jones","I would say no. And what I said my prepared remarks was, we\u2019ve structured that business in a way where we are trying to expose risks to volatility as associated to weather and to kind of protect ourselves against an unplanned generator outage, so we have the ability to generate 80 to 85 million megawatts hours a year. We\u2019re going to sell something less than that, so that as the load fluctuates with weather our committed load fluctuates with weather and\/or we have issues that any of our plants we have the ability to cover ourselves. That will \u2013 I understand were likely giving up some earnings potential from that business by taking risk out of it, but as I said earlier I\u2019d rather make it more predictable, more stable and get it out of the conversation as much as I can so we can talk about the type of company FirstEnergy really is which is a large regulated utility with 6 million customers.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s very clear. And just lastly very briefly the \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some relatively extreme weather through the winter time, in general how has the fleet performed through this sort of this winter period that you are seeing, have you been satisfied with the performance of the fleet and anything compared to sort of prior years in terms of performance trends.","Chuck Jones","I would say our fleet has performed very well, the markets have not. So had two units at the Bruce Mansfield plant that didn\u2019t run for six days in the last two weeks because the LMP at those plants we couldn\u2019t make money, so we didn\u2019t run out. So but the plants are available, they are running well, our generation team has done an amazing job between last year and this year getting ready for this winter.","Stephen Byrd","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning.","Chuck Jones","Hi Julien","Jim Pearson","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Congratulations again. I really wanted to focus on the transmission side of the business, specifically the guidance. What are you guys assuming in terms of an earned ROE, I know that may be awkward in the context of your pending case for ATSI, but can you give us a sense of how much lag is embedded in that number and as you turn towards the forward test year and implementing that in kind of a run rate for 2016 what kind of improvement should we be thinking about there and what\u2019s ultimately reflected in 2015 specifically?","Chuck Jones","All right. So I\u2019m not sure if I got all of those, I\u2019m going to answer the first quesztin and then you can answer or ask them one at a time, it will be easier for me to follow. So, but the first question on you know, we get that question a lot of what are we assuming about ATSI\u2019s rate of return going forward and here\u2019s how I view this. We just got first approval January 1st to move forward.","There are \u2013 there\u2019s a case now that going to be had and there\u2019s a settlement process that\u2019s going to be had and my view is we\u2019re going to go into those arguing like 12.38%, it makes sense going forward and it\u2019s stimulating the type of investment and reliability that I believe folks should want. And that\u2019s our going in position, anything from there I give you a number then we are going to be negotiating from that number. So we\u2019re not going to give you a number, we are going to go into those settlement that settlement process and we\u2019re going to make the best case we can to make sure that we get the right return for our investors so that we can continue making these investments in the way that we are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But from a regulatory lag perspective, what are you assuming if you can talk to that.","Chuck Jones","Regulatory lay we are assuming forward-looking rights.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. So there\u2019s not necessarily improvement next year as you have a full year or have you?","Chuck Jones","No.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got you. And then in terms of the outlook for transmission CapEx how are you feeling about flowing dollars in the transmission versus distribution. Can you kind of elaborate a little bit on where you see capital going in the future and then subsequently I know we\u2019ve discussed this before, on the distribution side, what kinds of future investments do you see now that you\u2019ve gone or about to go through all of the state utility rate case?","Chuck Jones","So lets take transmission first. We\u2019ve told you about 4.2 billion over a four year period that was in the second year of it was 1.4 billion the first year, it\u2019s 900 and some million in the second year. After two years we\u2019ll be right on track to be halfway through that and for 2016 and 2017 that will be the number.","We have $15 billion worth of projects in addition to those that are in the four year plan that we can\u2019t execute. That hopefully albeit in a position that when we talk to you later this year to articulate kind of more of a long term strategy for transmission and what we are planning to do there. But for the foreseeable future the numbers we\u2019ve given you is what my plans are and I think one of the things that I have to start doing is saying what we are going to do and then doing what we say. So I don\u2019t expect any change in that over the next couple of years.","On the distribution front, the rate cases in Pennsylvania are a huge step. It rebases those utilities and it was a necessary step if we decide to make reliability improvement investments in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has a methodology that\u2019s available to us called the disc that we can make investments, but as I told you when you came in, we got to get through these rate cases first and then we\u2019ll make decisions there. And in my prepared remarks I said once we get through the base rate case in New Jersey then I look forward to the certain amount of BTU and working together to figure out how we make JCP&L stronger going forward.","In Ohio we have a DCR mechanism that we have been using to invest in those utilities. So later this year I know you want numbers, I\u2019m not prepared to give you numbers today, but later this year, I think we can lay out a strategy of how much and where we plan to invest to start using our distribution utilities to improve service to customers and improve the picture for shareholders at the same time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got you. And you are interested in using the disc mechanism to be clear in terms of\u2026","Chuck Jones","I think we will definitely look at it once we are done and then decide is that the best way and does it allow the right investments because more importantly to me is making the right investments that truly benefit customers. And if that makes more sense to make them and just have traditional rate cases then we\u2019ll go that way. But to me we have to lay out what the plan is for customers first and make the right investments. If that can be done under the disc then the disc would be a smart way to do it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey good morning. More of like I guess a long term view question or I guess earlier in your remarks you had said that you are not interested in selling the generation assets and I maybe paraphrasing just you thought that was kind of a departmental market, but as I think three to five years if you are locking up the assets now in terms of the regulatory agreement, aren\u2019t you locking that in at these depressed prices and don\u2019t \u2013 three to five years will not be able to benefit if there is a power price recovery?","Chuck Jones","Well, so let me opine a little bit on what\u2019s going on in Ohio, and you know I am of the belief that long term those states that remained fully regulated when you have the opted\u2014the ability to optimize between generation transmission and distribution you are going to serve customers best. Some of our states chose to go to competitive markets. This whole discussion in Ohio is around whether or not we trust regulators better to look out for the long term interest of customers or whether we trust markets better to look out for the long term interest of the customers. Those states that are net importers of generation end up with the highest cost and don\u2019t have the ability to optimize between those three segments, so if the PPA is successful we\u2019re basically taking those plants and turning it over to the regulators to regulate them again. They will have a chance to look at how we run them, to look at the prudency of our expenses, but we are saying I think we trust the regulator to look out for a future Ohio more than we do the markets today.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to thank Tony for his leadership during the very very hard period and I wanted to congratulate you on your taking over the responsibility of the new position. Thank you.","Chuck Jones","Well thank you. And I\u2019m sure Tony does too, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s listening. We don\u2019t have a microphone in front of him, but I\u2019m sure he is listening this morning.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Ridzon of Keybanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Just I think you made a comment about 100 basis point of ROE at actually was it $16 million of net income?","Leila Vespoli","That was a comment I made and pre-tax, yes.","Paul Ridzon","Pre-tax, okay. And then I know you are not going to give a growth rate, but given the moving pieces we have with the timing of Pennsylvania rates coming in and New Jersey, do you think 2016 will be a step up from 2015 at the on the regulated side obviously competitive is going to be very well\u2026","Chuck Jones","Well 2015 only includes seven twelfths of what Pennsylvania is worth, so in 2016 it will be a full years worth of treatment and then beyond that we need to see where we land in New Jersey and Ohio.","Paul Ridzon","And what was your assumption as far as New Jersey in guidance?","Jim Pearson","Yes what we assumed in the guidance Paul was that it would be revenue neutral and that there would be $0.08 of storm caused amortization associated with the 2011 and 2012 storms.","Paul Ridzon","Effective one, is that going to bleed into 2016 as well?","Jim Pearson","That would be effective March 1st , so you might have just slightly higher amortization year-over-year.","Paul Ridzon","Any sense of when you are going to hold your Analyst Day?","Chuck Jones","Not yet.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thank you very much\u2026","Chuck Jones","It will be after we have a decision in Ohio, a decision in New Jersey, a decision hopefully on ATSI and then we\u2019ll go from there.","Paul Ridzon","Okay thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Chin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin","Hi good morning.","Chuck Jones","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Chin","About a year ago the management team had expressed a possible interest in looking at the REIT structure for transmission growth opportunities and given now that there is an entity out there that\u2019s you can see what the cost of capital is like, just wanted to see if you could give us an updated sense of that and Chuck also any comments you have there on your perspective?","Chuck Jones","I\u2019m not sure. We are always looking at any option that\u2019s out there, but I\u2019m not sure that we saw at that time or see today any real benefit to a REIT for our company. Our company is a little complex in terms of we\u2019ve got transmission that\u2019s inside utilities, transmission that\u2019s inside the ATSI, transmission that\u2019s inside TrAILCo the transmission that\u2019s inside ATSI, the real estate is owned by the utilities and I just think it\u2019s a distraction that would take a lot of time and effort of the management team to figure out that we don\u2019t need to be looking at right now because it doesn\u2019t provide any significant long term financial advantage for us.","Brian Chin","That\u2019s very clear. And then just one additional question you had mentioned in your prepared comments PJM West plant, plant box and some plants appear to be a little bit more struggling here. Is the primary criteria that you are thinking about cash flow accretion it seemed to be that you are leaning towards trying to get the merchant generation business to be cash flow positive so is that really the criteria that we should be thinking from a plant perspective here?","Chuck Jones","So we have the merchant generation business cash flow positive for the next four years at market forwards as we know them and with capacity as we know it. So that\u2019s not our goal, that\u2019s where we are at. As we see the changes that are happening with the capacity market reforms, that\u2019s going to be additive. We\u2019ve put ourselves in a position with our generating fleet that we\u2019re not forced to generate because we have load committements. We\u2019ve got a significant amount of our generation that\u2019s going to be market driven generation.","That gives us the ability like I said two weeks ago to say if Mansfield is not in the money we\u2019re not going to run it and loose money. So we\u2019re going to optimize it and that optimization is something that we\u2019re going to do day in day out. We\u2019re going to do day in kind of more as we look at any options on the retail side as new customer opportunities present themselves, but the goal is, is cash flow positive and were there. And then beyond that we want to obviously drive it more cash flow positive so that we can start getting additional flexibility in that part of our business down the road.","Brian Chin","Thank you very much.","Meghan Beringer","Manny we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. The final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thanks guys for taking my call this late in the hour. Just thinking about the balance sheet and capital structure, you guys did a really good job year and a half or so ago of reducing the debt levels at the competitive business. You narrow in a position where you\u2019ve got a lot of debt at the holding company level and a lot of it is short term or floating rate, many economist would argue that short term debt is probably at its all time lows and that directionally short term debt is likely heading high up.","Do you have any thoughts in terms of how you can deal with the significant amount of short term debt that\u2019s on the balance sheet, meaning whether you would turn [ph] it out and therefore kind of lock in a long term interest rate for that and kind of give yourself some multiyear certainty of that or would you potentially pay it off and if so where \u2013 how would you where would you receive the proceeds or how would you generate the proceeds to pay down some debt?","Jim Pearson","Michael, at this point I think we need to see how a number of these initiatives play out. If you think about the PPA in Ohio finalizing the rate cases, the potential for the capacity performance product I think that will give us a much clear sense of what our cash projections will be going forward. At this point we have no plans to term out any of the long term debt that\u2019s sitting at the Holdco. I do agree with you that we are carrying more debt at that level than either Chuck and I are comfortable with, but as we lay out our long term plan going forward, it will be our intention to strengthen the balance sheet and with that reducing some of that debt at the holding company, but at this point I cannot give you a specific plan to do that until we know some of the outcomes of these major initiatives.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks Jim and Chuck, congratulations.","Chuck Jones","Thanks Mike.","Chuck Jones","Okay, well I\u2019d like to thank you all for your continued support of FirstEnergy and I think you know our goal today was to give you a clear and transparent view of our company and to build the foundation for our growth strategy that we will lay out in more detail this year at the analyst meeting. I\u2019m proud to have the opportunity to take over for Tony. I am proud of our employees at FirstEnergy because I truly believe that\u2019s what makes our company strong and I\u2019m thankful for our six million customers and obviously all of our investors.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Beringer","","Thank you, Christine, and good afternoon. Welcome to FirstEnergy's fourth quarter earnings call. First, please be reminded that during this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the business of FirstEnergy Corp are based on current expectations that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause the actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.","Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the consolidated report to the financial community which was released earlier today and is also available on our website under the earnings information and financial releases link.","Today, we will be referring to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations to GAAP earning from operating earnings are contained in the consolidated report, as well as on the investor information section on our website at www.firstenergycorp.com\/ir.","Please note that our annual report on Form 10-K is expected to be filed within the next several days.","Participating in today's call, are Tony Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Markets, and Chief Legal Officer; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Donny Schneider, President of First Energy Solutions; John Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steven Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tony Alexander.","Tony Alexander","Thank you, Meghan, and good afternoon everyone. I'm glad you could join us. I will start today's call with an overview of 2013 including our unaudited results and accomplishments. We will also take another look at our areas of focus for 2014 and the next several years. I will then turn the call over to Leila. In January, Leila took on an expanded role that now includes responsibility for our competitive business. So she will provide a power market outlook in addition to our normal update on regulatory developments.","Finally, Jim will share a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter financial results and review our 2013 financial achievements. Then, he will discuss 2014 initiatives before turning the call over for questions.","Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we announced operating earnings of $0.75 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $3.04 per share for the full year at the upper end of our guidance which reflects our strong operating performance for the year.","As you know, 2013 was a challenging year for the company as we took action to improve our financial position, lower our cost structure and position the company for more stable and predictable growth through our regulated holdings. And some of our key accomplishments included successfully implementing our financial plan which reduced our debt out of our competitive business by $1.5 billion, improved its credit metrics and strengthened its balance sheet.","We reconfigured our generation, our competitive generation fleet and as a result reduced cost while retaining a mix of generating assets that is more cost effective, efficient and environmentally sound. We also successfully completed the Harrison and Pleasants' asset transfer, which is expected to help ensure reliable power for our Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia for many years to come. We deactivated the Hatfield and Mitchell plants. And we recently completed the sale of certain hydro units.","Finally, we announced a long term growth strategy in our transmission business, targeting $4.2 billion in investments over the next four years. In combination these actions and others are repositioning the company's business profile to be far more focused on regulated operations.","Respecting our business results for 2013, I will start with our competitive operations. During the year, contract sales at FirstEnergy Solutions increased 9% from 2012 to nearly 109 million megawatt-hours. Full year total generation output was nearly 93 million megawatt-hours, which is about a 4% decrease from 2012, and that largely reflects the smaller size of our competitive fleet that occurred during the calendar year 2013.","Our Nuclear Fleet completed several significant achievements, including the successful installation of new low pressure turbines at both Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 1. These installations will increase our nuclear capacity by about 45 megawatts. Both Davis-Besse and Beaver Valley continue their overall strong and safe operating performance and Perry returned to the nuclear regulatory commissions routine levels oversight recognizing its improved operational and safety performance.","We also completed a large volume of work at Davis-Besse to support a steam generator replacement project which began February 1st of 2014.","Our Fossil Fleet also performed well. And after significant work to ensure the most economic approach to address upcoming environmental requirements we began installation of new emissions equipment at our units.","Earlier this month, we received notice that PJM would discontinue the RMR arrangements for our Eastlake and Lake Shore Plants as of September 15, 2014, about six months ahead of schedule. As a result, we planned to deactivate those units later this year, which would leave us with one remaining RMR agreement for the Ashtabula plant which is a 244 megawatt facility and that agreement will run through April, 2015.","We are moving forward with our plans to convert Eastlake's generating units to synchronous condensers that will improve good reliability through voltage regulation. The Unit 5 synchronizer was installed and became operational in 2013 and we expect to complete the conversion of units 1 through 4 by the summer of 2015.","Leila will provide more insight into our committed sales and other expectations for 2014. But it is important to recognize that despite the unlevel playing field and competitive capacity in energy markets we continue to be a strong supplier of choice by customers.","Moving now to review our Distribution business. During 2013, total distribution sales increased by 1%. We are encouraged by the slight growth in commercial sales of 0.5% on a weather adjusted basis, particularly because the commercial sector has not shown any meaningful recovery since the beginning of the recession.","Residential sales were up slightly. But more importantly, we increased our residential customer count across the system. We now serve more customers than we did in 2007, which was the peak year of economic activity, pointing again to a growing customer base.","Another bright spot is sales to industrial customers which were up a healthy 2%. This was primarily driven by manufacturing segments related to the shale gas in our region, as well as a slight pickup in the automotive sector. We are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing signs of more sustained recover in both the commercial and industrial sectors and that these are indicators of an economic intern that could help drive growth in our utility business.","From a reliability standpoint, our utilities had a solid year in 2013 and we continue working to enhance our service to customers, particularly during severe weather. As an example, we recently implemented an incident command system to plan and manage our facilities, equipment, personnel and communications during storm events. In addition, during 2013, we completed our new transmission control center which is designed to make our current high level of transmission service reliability even better. The control center operates approximately two-thirds of the bulk transmission system and features the R-bulk transmission system and features the industries most advanced monitoring and operations technologies.","Shifting now to our expectations for 2014 and the next few years. As we have said, we have significantly repositioned our business mix and earnings profile by turning our strategic focus to more predictable and sustainable growth through systematic investments in our core regulated businesses. We are targeting 80% or more of our earnings through regulated operations in 2014 and going forward.","As you know, this morning we affirmed our 2014 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.85 per share including operating earnings guidance range for each of our segments. We also provided a first quarter operating earnings range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share, which includes the planned Davis-Besse extended refueling and steam generator replacement outage that started on February 1st, as well as our estimates for the impact of extreme weather.","We intend to set a relatively conservative course over the next few years that is focused on taking advantage of well defined and attainable opportunities. In our utility business, while we anticipate only modest load growth of above 0.6% in 2014 with most of that coming from the industrial sector, our service area is soluble positioned to benefit from further development in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields and the manufacturing growth that should accompany that development.","My sense is that when this area success for an attracting a cracker plant it will stimulate and accelerate the manufacturing expansion potential in our service area. And while economic strength is the most critical engine for distribution growth, we also continue to prepare for rate cases that will be filed in West Virginia in April and potential cases in Pennsylvania later this year. These efforts are expected to produce associated modest earnings growth for our utility companies over time.","In our Transmission business, consistent with our announcement late last year, we are starting to move forward with the $4.2 billion in capital expenditures through the 2014 to 2017 timeframe. These investments are expected o support continued system reliability and enhance service to our customers while driving much of our growth over the next several years. We will initially focus on investments in axing on the 69 KB system and above in Ohio and Pennsylvania and certain other projects in Trioco, both of which received formula rate recovery.","With the introduction of this transmission growth program, we expect to begin to see an uptick in our result from this business over the next two years followed by a more significant earnings contribution starting in 2016. Well, these planned investments in growth will take some time to fully execute, we remain committed to creating value to our significant and diverse asset base. We appreciate your support.","Now, I will turn over to Leila for regulatory and power markets update. Leila?","Leila Vespoli","Thanks, Tony. I will start with an update of the status of several matters in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio before moving to a high level look at FirstEnergy Solutions and developments in our region's power market.","Starting with New Jersey, yesterday we signed and filed a settlement agreement with board staff in rate council to permit recovery in base rates of $736 million of JCP&L, $744 million of cost related to the significant weather events of 2011 and 2012.","The agreement upon which no other party took a position to oppose or support is now pending approval before the board of public utilities. Of course, we still do have a base rate case pending in New Jersey. Hearings have concluded and we filed a reply brief rate in this case yesterday. We expect resolution of the base rate case within the next four months.","Let's turn to Pennsylvania for an update and the transmission service charge rider, which relates to the recovery of $254 million in marginal transmission losses and associated carrying costs for the June, 2007 through March, 2008 period. As you know, we completed the process of refunding Met-Ed and Penelec customers in this case last spring and we recognized an impairment for this item in our third quarter financial statement after the US District Court dismissed our proceeding. However, we continue to believe in the merits of our position and during the fourth quarter we appealed to the third circuit. Briefs have been filed and oral argument has been scheduled for April 9.","Moving now to Ohio, in December, the public utilities commission denied our re-hearing request for recovery of $43 million of renewable energy credit purchased to comply with Ohio's renewable energy portfolio standard. On December 24th, we filed the notice of appeal and motion for stay of the PUCL order with the Supreme Court of Ohio. The court granted our stay on February 10. I should also note that two additional parties that filed the case, the Office of Consumers' Counsel and the Environmental Law and Policy Center. We expect briefing will occur through the spring, but we do not expect an opinion from the court this year.","Ohio's polar auction that took place on January 28 resulted in a clearing price of $55.83 for a one year product and $68.31 for a two year product for the delivery period starting June, 2014. FES own five one-year projects and two two-year projects in this auction. These results are blended with previous auctions to establish retail generation rates starting June 1, 2014 and will affect certain of our retail rate. Significantly, these prices are about $5 and $8 higher than the auction that took place in October and would indicate that bidders are beginning to allow for some additional risk premium.","Respecting our competitive business, FirstEnergy Solutions increased its retail base by approximately 100,000 customers during 2013 and now serves about 2.7 million customers. Going forward, we intent to be more selective in our sales strategy in response to market environment and our smaller generating fleet. In fact, on February 12, we completed the previous announced sale of 527 megawatts of competitive hydro assets for approximately $395 million. We expect our fleet to produce 77 million megawatt-hours and our sales strategy targets 99 million megawatt-hours this year. Consistent with our glide path we are well hedged with 94 million megawatt-hours, currently committed for 2014.","And looking ahead we have booked 52 million megawatt-hours for 2015 and 29 million megawatt-hours for 2016, with a substantial portion of these sales in government aggregation and polar channel. These sales are on track with a lower end of our glide path and should allow us to take advantage of any increases in market and energy prices that may occur in that time frame.","Now let me take a moment to discuss in more detail the extreme weather in our region over the past months and in January in particular that impacted our competitive retail supply business. We incurred increased purchase power expense related to higher than forecast, customer usage during several extreme weather periods, as well as additional energy necessary to replace unit availability. Beaver Valley Unit 1 was not operating from most of January while we have replaced the main transformer. We were fortunate to have a spare on plant site. And we also experience some other unplanned powerful unit outages and delays.","We also expect to see increased PJM charges for ancillary expenses in the first quarter of 2014, the majority of which we expect to recover for retail customers. These expenses includes synchronous and operating reserves which are necessary for reliability and socialize across the load-serving entities based on load share.","PJM is still accessing the January settlement data and we plan to provide a more detailed update during our first quarter earnings call in early May. The situation with market power prices in January was a product of base load generation that was stretched to its limit and exasperated by gas units that were impacted by constrain gas transmission and high spot trading prices.","Together with others in our industry, we will continue to diligently focus on advocating for reforms that are necessary to assure that the PJM market is in a position to provide reliable power and stable prices to customers.","Now I will turn to call over to Jim.","Jim Pearson","","Thanks, Leila. Let's move right into our financial results. You may want to refer to the consolidated report which was issued this morning and is available on our website. As Tony mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter operating earnings of $75 per share were at the higher end of our expectations, these results compared fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings of $80 per share.","On a GAAP basis, this year's unaudited fourth quarter earnings were $34 per share, compared to a loss of $35 per share last year. The full list and special items that make up the $41 per share difference between GAAP and operating earnings can be found on page 4 of the consolidated report.","Most significant of these are a charge of $51 per share related to the transfer of our Harrison and Pleasants plants in West Virginia, a $14 per share charge related to plant deactivation cost associated with a closure of fossil units, and regulator charges of $12 per share. These were partially offset by a gain of $38 per share related to our annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment which benefited from a higher discount rate.","Other special items for the fourth quarter include trust securities impairment of $0.02 per share, non-core assets impairments of $0.02 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share related to merger accounting for commodity contracts and a gain of $0.04 per share for other mark-to-market adjustments.","Let's move now to review of our business results. In our distribution business, higher revenues increased fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 per share as total distribution deliveries increased 4% or 1.4 million megawatt-hours, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","On the Residential and Commercial side, the gains during the quarter were largely weather driven with colder winter temperatures driving 3% increases in both residential and commercial sales. Adjusted for weather, residential sales were essentially flat while commercial sales were up slightly. And as Tony said, this continued a positive trend from the third quarter which comes on a yields of a very long period of no commercial growth.","Looking at industrial deliveries, sales increased 6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 driven again by shale gas activity in the field sector, as well as continued growth among our automotive customers.","Reiterating Tony's comments a few minutes ago, our outlook for low growth remains cautious but these are bright signs relative to what we have seen in the year since the recession began.","To provide more transparency in our distribution business and as a result of the Harrison plant asset transfer in the fourth quarter, we are providing operating margin at our regulated generation business which increased earnings by $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter.","Moving to commodity margin and our competitive business. Commodity margin decreased earnings by $0.09 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and total competitive generation output decreased by 3.3 million megawatt-hours in the quarter. Fuel expense was lower in the quarter, helping to offset the higher purchase power cost that result from the Hatfield and the Mitchell plant closures, the Harrison transfer and increased contract sales.","Contract sales increased 2.3 million megawatt-hours compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Looking at each of our channels structured sales nearly doubled compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to higher municipal, cooperative and bilateral sales. Governmental aggregation sales increased 10%, largely reflecting further expansion into Illinois where we have side 108 new communities since the fourth quarter of last year.","Marketing campaigns in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois resulted in a 27% increase in mass market sales. Direct sales to large and medium size commercial and industrial customers increased 2%, reflecting service to more customers in Central and Southern Ohio. Other drivers of commodity margin include, higher capacity revenues, increased capacity expense in transmission cost and lower wholesale sales.","Looking at the other drivers of fourth quarter results, higher O&M expense decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This primarily reflects more normal operations expense in 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 during which much of our workforce was involved in storm recovery activities.","Finally, lower interest expense impacted results by $0.01 per share and investment income increased earnings by $0.02 per share, mostly from higher nuclear decommissioning trust income and higher earnings from our investment in Signal Peak. ","As Tony mentioned in his open remarks, one of our key achievements in 2013 was strengthening the credit metrics and balance sheets of our operating companies. We achieved this through the successful execution of the financial plan that we outlined early in the year.","I will take a moment to walk you through the highlights of these activities. We issued $1.5 billion in FE Corp long term notes at a very attractive interest rate. We significantly improve credit metrics at our competitive business through a $1.5 billion equity infusion from FirstEnergy Corp combined with $1.5 billion in debt reduction and FES and allocating energy supply. And we extended the maturity of our existing credit facilities to May, 2018 and increased the First Energy utilities facility by $500 million, and we also strengthened the balance sheets of our utilities through our efforts to refinance debt reduce short term borrowings and through securitization in Ohio.","Through this series of actions, we successfully improved the balance sheet of both our competitive and regulated businesses and enhanced consolidated liquidity. We remain committed to investment grade credit metrics at each of our businesses.","Beginning in 2014, we are entering a capital intensive period with expenditures estimated at $3.3 billion this year, primarily due to the increased transmission investments. Over the next several years we intend to fund the transmission expansion program through a combination of debt, previously announced equity issuances through the stock investment and employee benefit plans and cash. And while we expect our competitive operations to be cash flow positive, we intend to minimize other investments in our competitive business during this period, with a notable exception as a planned work to extend the life of our nuclear units and environmental compliance in our fossil units.","We will continue to look for opportunities to further reduce our costs while preserving the flexibility to create and take advantage of opportunities to move forward with more predictable and stable growth.","Now I will ask the operator to open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","First, I just wanted to clarify your comments on the first quarter guidance if you could. Could you provide a little bit more clarity in terms of how much of the year-on-year impact is from the outages and perhaps also how much is impacted from the latest weather, if you will, versus plan when you release '14 guidance?","Tony Alexander","Julien, in the main, I mean, as you look through the year, you got to remember that in part the first quarter would not have only affected by the Davis-Besse outage, which is scheduled for basically all of February and all of March; losing Beaver Valley was also impacting that January timeframe. So the first quarter is going to be impacted by that probably more than we would have expected, but about in the same range as where we were originally anticipating.","As you think about the year, however, the growth in earnings from the segment were rising as time went on. For example, the capacity revenue in the first quarter of this year is about $27 a megawatt a day or whatever that is. Starting in June it goes to $126 per megawatt a day. So there is a very large impact on capacity revenues quarter to quarter as you move through this timeframe.","Also, when we talk about the annual guidance over the year need to think about the transmission investments that we are making in the earnings that arise from the -- when you start those expenditures in January they grow over time. And as they are placed in service in the later part of the year, those earnings tend to be more tail end loaded than front end loaded in this overall timeframe. So while the first quarter with expectations are probably little lower than what people would have thought normally just by dividing by four they're not too far off of what we would have otherwise expected.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And so perhaps just to summarize, how do you think about your net exposure ultimately to the latest volatility on pricing? Was it net benefit or net reduction I mean, sort of excluding the impact of the Beaver Valley outage?","Tony Alexander","Julien, we are going to go through all this stuff when we get to the first quarter timeframe. We are only through one month of the first quarter. But obviously, when you have the type of weather we had, we had more sales on both the competitor side and the utility side in January than we otherwise would have anticipated. And obviously with the extension of the Beaver Valley outage part of which we have already talked about earlier I think, this year towards the end of last -- earlier this year, that had an impact. And clearly there the prices were somewhat higher than we would otherwise anticipated and we are also seeing some PJM costs that are a little higher than we would have anticipated, but we don\u2019t have the final bills on all of those things yet.","So I think at this point that the best way to look at it is that from a company perspective, guidance range is the same and segment ranges are the same. So how they shake out during the year and the actions we will take offsetting one way or the other, will take place naturally as it always does during a year when you are dealing with multiple issues.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering and Holt. Please proceed with your question.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering and Holt","Hi, good morning, I just had another question on maybe the retail exposure. When you look at super peak periods, do you typically used the FE fleet with peakers to serve that demand or do you usually go out into the spot market to procure some of that, but I know that you are fleet is more heavily weighted towards the base load than the peaking generation. So just wanted to know how you handle that going forward?","Donny Schneider","Neel, this is Donny. We rely heavily on our fleet as you know but we also utilize call options and purchase power as need be. If the fleets running flat out the way per design, we are pretty well hedged; we don\u2019t have to rely much on the spot market.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering and Holt","Okay. So, I'm trying to understand this just a little bit better. Is the exposure that you incurred in Q1 as a result of some of your base load plants being out on an unplanned outage and you being forced buy power or was it from kind of the spot power that you would buy from the peaking transaction side of it?","Donny Schneider","Yes, I think as Leila and Tony both said, obviously we at the Beaver Valley outage that was almost the entire month. In addition, to that while in aggregate for the month our fissile fleet ran pretty well, we did have some outages at our Mansfield plant that occurred in inopportune times, specifically when there was a very coldest weather and the prices were the very highest. So having to buy to replace for those outages was expensive.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering and Holt","","Got it. And then, Leila, can you kind of outline the strategy in Pennsylvania for the rate cases? With the four utilities as we are going to file them at different times are all at one time or are there certain utilities where you plan not to file rate cases?","Leila Vespoli","","Neel, so we are still looking in that but I would imagine when we file we would file the cases that we are going to file this year at one point in time. But as to the particular utilities, I am not prepared to say right now. Obviously, we would want to talk to folks in Pennsylvania and tee that up before announcing that publicly.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering and Holt","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey, good afternoon. I guess we may -- we try to understand that the guidance question maybe little better, so I apologize for repeating this to death. But if you assume normal weather for the three quarters of the year as you would have light up the plan when you guy revised it for the year, where would you guys fallout within the $2.45 to $2.85 range?","Toney Alexander","","Steve?","Steven Staub","Dan, I think if I understand your question you are trying to find out where we would fall between the two goalposts, $2.45 to $2.85?","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Right.","Steven Staub","I think we are at -- and as way I see it right now, although we had some extreme weather and had some higher cost there is other items that we have identified that would help offset that. Take -- one example would be the higher prices than we originally expected would happen in the Ohio auction. So I am pretty comfortable that we are still right in the same range that we talked about on the last call.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Okay. So you are comfortable in the middle of the range, so this is -- the first quarter variants was within your plan?","Steven Staub","Yeah, I am still comfortable that we are at the same place within our range, yes.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then, I guess on a New Jersey, the -- can you just give me that data once going on with the CTA and you are kind of where that JCP and all rate case gets done with that issue still outstanding?","Leila Vespoli","","Okay. So a lot of moving pieces and parts in Jersey. So with the settlement of the storm case, we roughly -- with respect to the $7.5 million that roughly makeover $1.5 million in revenue requirement. So while the settlement deals with the prudence, if you will, of those dollars, what it does not settle is whether the 2012 storm dollars are going to go back into the rate case. If you recall the BPU had indicated that 2011 storm cost would go back. And so, roughly according to our approach and how you would look at the storm cost roughly -- the revenue requirement roughly $23 million would go back into the base rate case. And we are now briefing as to whether the 2012 storm cost should go back in.","But if you think about the commission's or the BPU's original order establishing the test year, they established the 2000 test year but also included any out of period measurable changes that were shown to be prudent, were major in nature in consequence and that were quantified though proof and had reliable data. I think the 2012 storm cost fit all those categories, so I think we have a very good argument to pull those strong cost back into the base rate case.","Where we stand with respect to that, with five briefs have been filed. ALJ has 45 days to issue their decision, his decision and there is no extension, reply exceptions are generated around 30 days and the BPU may be another 30 or 60 days.","With respect to the CTA, I would have love to have position paper by the staff. Unfortunately, that did not come out prior to the briefs in the rate case and staff took a position that was consistent with the BPUs order which said that until we have an ultimate decision in the CTA generic proceeding, we were going to continue with what their prior position had been. So that essentially was they were negative with respect to us and the CTA. So will I still would like to see an order coming out of the commission with respect to the generic proceeding in the CTA, it is definitely on a slower path than I would have anticipated.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","I mean is there a chance that CTA you can get done before the case gets done and if it is not getting done is there a way to just slow down your case and hopes it does get resolved because it is not an inconsequential issue?","Leila Vespoli","","You are correct. It is not an inconsequential issue, it is roughly $56 million in revenue requirement and roughly would negate about a quarter of the rate base. So just looking at it from that perspective shows the gross and fairness of applying a CTA adjustment in this case. I would hope that BPU would look at that. The fact that JCP already has the lowest rate in the state of New Jersey, which again further exasperates the consequence of that. But right now, we need the staff to issue an order and I have not seen a timeline for that to happen.","Ultimately, if the BPU should be issue an order and should be negative in terms of not providing further the CTA in appropriate manner, our option would be file another rate case. And by that time the decision on the next case, I believe we should have a resolution of the generic case.","","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Just a quick financial. First, on the competitive segment, the interest expense around $35 million, the full capitalization in fourth quarter, is that a reasonable run rate going forward or is there something else going in there? Have we kind of found the new level with the all the repositioning of the balance sheet?","Tony Alexander","Yes, I think it would generally be slightly higher than that, Jonathan. You might recall we called in one pollution control note, that was about $230 some million and we had a about $10 million favorable interest that Dutchman associated it with that.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","In 4Q and specifically in competitive?","Tony Alexander","","Yes, that generally grow the $0.01 improvement in earnings that I talked about.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","There is a number from third quarter, probably a better level?","Tony Alexander","Yes, I would say that is correct, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, I missed the number you had on the hedging for 2015, would you mind repeating that? I apologize. I think I got 94 in '14 and 29 in 16.","Steven Staub","","That was in years later, was it?","Unidentified Company Speaker","","56?","Tony Alexander","Yes, we have 52 million megawatt-hours in 2015 Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And is this as of right now or is that as of end of the year?","Tony Alexander","","That is current right now.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And so, you talked about being at the lower end of the glide path and to be positioning yourselves to take advantage of moves. We have seen some moves, particularly in the winter pricing in '15 and to an extent in '16. Can you tall at all about kind of what you have, how you -- what you have been hedging? Are you kind of locking in any about seasonality or just generally trying to stay as open as you can given the increased volatility we've seen in the market?","","Donny Schneider","","Jonathan, this is Donny. We have not really tried to position it for seasonality up to this point. Generally, what happens is the customers are going to buy to lineup with the planning here so to speak. So it is not unusual for a customer to want to buy June through May or perhaps though by on a calendar year, but to this point we have not seen much customer demand for kind of a seasonal -- not say we won't be looking at that but at this point we have not have that opportunity.","","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon.","Tony Alexander","","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","Hi, Tony. I guess this question might be for Leila. I think you mention the PJM ancillary cost that some of those get pass through the customers?","Leila Vespoli","","Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","","Is that just in certain states or how does that work? How do we know which areas get pass through or not?","Leila Vespoli","It is pursuant to contract in a specific language within the contract so it is not a state by state kind of thing, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","","Okay. So it is certain types of your customer classes?","","Leila Vespoli","","In?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","In a retail business?","Leila Vespoli","It is not even the same throughout particular classes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","Okay.","Leila Vespoli","It is as that contract language was developed for that particular customer or grouping of customer. So there is no way I can even give it to you by segment.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","","Okay. So some of the cause when you get this data come up will be cause that you absorb but some of those would be available to essentially pass through your contracts to the customers?","Leila Vespoli","Correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","And in the future, do most of your contracts have that clause, so new ones do or not older ones or vice versa?","Leila Vespoli","","I think it would be safe to say that we are going to be adding that language where we can in the future.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe","Got it. Okay. Thank you. Just want to clarify that.","Leila Vespoli","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to just explore retail margins in the out years and just given the kind of volatility that we are seeing I think on some of your prepared remarks you talked briefly that maybe recognition of greater volatility being reflected in markets. But just curious, if you could talk at a high level to given the kind of volatility you are seeing? Is that impacting how you see the margin potential on the retail side events?","Donny Schneider","Yes, Steven this is Donny. I think especially if you look at like the Ohio polar auction and you can see that those prices are up substantially, I think that's reflective of the volatility. Obviously, as we move forward and price new contracts on the retail side, we will begin the higher volatility so they will naturally drive the margins up, if you will.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Understood, and just relating to that volatility topic, given the kind of volatility we have seen, is that caused you to think further about through the right size or role of the retail position in terms of the target gigawatt hours or you sort of comfortable where you are?","Tony Alexander ","Steven, I think you are always looking at where your right level of sales are and, in part, it's driven by what the market provides or delivers to you. If customers are willing to pay the risk premium associated with carrying the volatility in the market then I suspect you will see retail sales at certain levels if customers are not anticipating paying that, but I would expect it would be a just to (inaudible) because the cost don't go away from a volatility stand point. And some point the market is going to have to period.","And at the end it's going to be whether or not it is going to be from a customer stand point or ultimately at that point whether or not a retail market for customers exists in the same format that we see it today. We are already seeing the impact of variable pricing on not only industrial customer for residential and commercial customers that have chosen that path whether or not they stay in that environment over a long period of time is if volatility continues to be a issue in the market and my own sense is that perhaps it will given the structure of it we could see some very different forms of retail contracts.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Can you just speak, Tony, maybe a little further to those different forms of retail contracts that you are (inaudible)?","Tony Alexander","Well, like Donny said, there could be more adjustment clauses in them, there could be more risk add it to fix contractor. There is a whole series of things that could be put in place to try to mitigate or address those types of differing issues.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Steven, this is (inaudible). The list that Tony just gave one of the things that you clearly look at is tolerance bands. What we are seeing today in the marketplace any customer that had decided to go to an hourly kind of product they are already calling us and wanting something different because they were obviously hit high prices in the month of January.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I see and so some of your customers are seeking that reduce that risk, we'll just have to see the degree to which they are willing to paid to get that risk protection.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Okay.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just quickly following up on Steve's question with respect to the ancillary service cost, you guys mentioned that there was still some settlement and settlement billing that had to be coming out of PJM and we're going to January and February and obviously I guess March coming up, but any sense that we might see in terms of if there is any variation with this or any quantitative numbers that we might be talking about that some range in terms of exposure here or?","Leila Vespoli","I can tell you with respect to kind of global PJM and ancillary resources and again these are parsed out on load ratio share. Just kind of order of magnitude for ancillary services the billing throughout PJM for January 2014 equaled the charge for ancillary services for all of 2013.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Which is how much? Roughly speaking not putting on the spot, if you don't have it that's okay. I just -- ","Leila Vespoli","$800 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","I'm sorry, could you repeat that?","Leila Vespoli","$800 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","$800 million?","Tony Alexander","That's PJM total, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","No, I got you. Okay. But you guys do with your contracting and everything and you are hedging that you guys have been able to really mitigate the exposure to this stuff, correct? I mean, if I understood you guys correctly right? It's all in guidance other words.","Tony Alexander","We are working through that process right now on a contract by contract basis and we work with PJM to make sure that the buildings that also got (inaudible) charge to us are appropriate.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally on the Ohio alternative energy monitor that $40 million is there any ongoing exposure other than that which you guys are fighting, which you guys are going to court on? Is there any other exposure going forward that we should think about with respect to that at all?","Leila Vespoli","No, I don't believe so.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with you question.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays","On Davis-Besse, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the scope of the work around the unplanned concrete fixtures during the current outage and kind of the level of correspondence that's required with the MRC?","Tony Alexander","I will try to give you as much as I can. Gregg. Don't hold me as being the expert on this at this point. I have briefed a couple of times, but we will go through the process, we believe that what we found is that structurally significant to the overall shields integrity. And it is fixable in the upcoming when we actually close the opening. It primarily resulted, if I understand it correctly primarily resulted because this was a -- it was left in a more temporary position with framing still in place on the back side, because we knew we're going to cut it again in a year. What happened is that it didn't completely settle into all areas and so there were some gaps. We think it's fixable fairly straightforward inside the scope of the timeframe of this outage.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays","Thank you.","Tony Alexander","Operator, Christine, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Paul Freemont with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","Thank you. Just point a clarification on the JCPL case is if the 12 costs are not included in the GRC, would they be included in whatever the NJBPU decision is in the generic proceeding or would you have to wait for a whole new rate case to include those costs?","Leila Vespoli","The answer is unknown. The BPU left open the possibility of another mechanism for recovery unspecified in nature. So obviously we would prefer something that gives us more immediate recovery even if it's not included within the current base rate case that's in front of the BPU right now, but as kind of an outside bookings to think about if they weren't included, if things didn't go on our way we would be filing another rate case basically on the heels of this decision and we would get those costs included in that case.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","Okay. And the second question is of the $736 million of costs that you identified how much of that would essentially represent an increase in the rate base of the company?","Leila Vespoli","The $736 million is all (inaudible) represent it is all rate base.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","But I guess some of it is going to be the recovering (inaudible)","Leila Vespoli","I'm sorry -- ","Tony Alexander","Let us give that number for you. I think the rate base numbers in the $400 million range -- ","Leila Vespoli","Its $407 million in capital and $329 million in deferred.","Tony Alexander","You got that?","Leila Vespoli","Sorry about that. Okay.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","Okay. So essentially it's $407 million of increased rate base?","Tony Alexander","Yes, that would be the capital fees. That's right, Paul.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","Okay. And you would be able to earn a full return equity or full weighted average cost to capital return on that $407 million, right?","Tony Alexander","We should, yes.","Paul Freemont - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tony Alexander","Thanks Paul. I like to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your continued support and we remain committed to providing long time value and sustainable growth.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, Roya, and good afternoon. Welcome to FirstEnergy\u2019s second quarter earnings call. First, please be reminded that during this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the consolidated report to the financial community, which was released earlier today and is also available on our website under the Earnings Information link.","Today, we will be referring to operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating earnings per share by segment and EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are contained in the consolidated report, as well as on the investor information section on our website at www.firstenergycorp.com\/ir.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Since our last earnings call, we have made significant progress on the plans we have outlined to execute a regulated growth strategy, implement additional cost reductions and further reduce risk in our competitive business.","We have several positive developments to discuss today, including the two rate filings in our distribution business that were announced yesterday and a shift in our competitive sales strategy as well as progress report on the transmission growth initiatives that are well underway.","We have a lot of ground to cover today, so let\u2019s get started.","I\u2019ll begin by taking a few minutes to discuss key developments in our transmission business. As you know, our energizing the Future transmission expansion program is designed to modernize our grid, reinforce the current system in light of expected plant deactivations and handle load growth primarily related to shale gas development.","This year alone, we are on course to complete $1.3 billion in investments, spanning more than 1,300 projects. These include replacing equipment with advanced technology, reinforcing substation facilities with advanced surveillance and security technologies and rebuilding 234 miles of transmission line.","In addition to these projects, we are on track to build a new 138 kV substation near Clarksburg, West Virginia and an 18-mile connecting project to support load growth in that area. We have also completed more than one-third of the nearly 100 projects associated with plant deactivations. These include the Eastlake 4 and 5 synchronous condensers, a new 345 kV to 138 kV substation and a 59-mile 345 line in Northwest Ohio.","Currently, we have nearly 1,500 workers engaged to support the engineering, procurement and construction of these Energizing the Future initiatives. Our management processors are in place to sustain the growth targets we\u2019ve previously identified as well as our current in plan construction efforts.","On the distribution side of the business, while Leila will fill in the details, we filed applications for all of our Pennsylvania utilities, seeking an increase in annual revenues of approximately $416 million. This increase would place our average rates for distribution service in Pennsylvania about on par with the average rates charged by other major Pennsylvania utilities.","We also filed a new electric security plan for our Ohio utilities, which we\u2019re calling Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress. The filing proposes the continuation of many of the terms of the current ESP but also includes an economic stability program that will help protect customers from retail volatility and price increases that result from rising energy and capacity prices in future years.","This program would also help ensure the continued investment in and operation of significant base load assets located primarily in Ohio. These plants provide fuel diversity as well as substantial employment, tax and economic benefits.","We now have pending applications in New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio which is consistent with our focus on regulated operations and should better position these companies to address the ongoing challenges of upgrading, modernizing and maintaining adequate and reliable electric service.","Let\u2019s move to a discussion about competitive markets which we believe are clearly in transition and how we are proactively responding by adapting our operations to create value. While we have experienced a relatively stable and predictable wholesale market for the past several years, we believe that a fundamental change in markets is underway as available generation is being reduced due to environmental rules and competitive market to rely more heavily on natural gas and other less reliable resources.","We saw the first evidence of this last year during hotter weather in September at the beginning of the plant outage season. Then this past winter\u2019s polar vortex highlighted again the issues the markets will likely face as a fleet of assets to provide a central electric service is fundamentally changed.","And when you couple those changes with a market construct that is eroding the price stability necessary to offer retail customers predictable prices, the risk associated with serving retail loads will rise. As a result, we are taking action to better position the company\u2019s competitive operations and generation fleet going forward. This is consistent with our expectations that wholesale energy prices generally will be more volatile and the current forwards do not fully reflect the change in market fundamentals.","While Leila will describe our competitive strategy in more detail, key accents include reducing our exposure to weather sensitive retail loads and maintaining a more open position to take advantage of market upsides and to provide our own reserve margins since the wholesale markets can no longer be relied upon to assure reasonable pricing.","We are in a good position to do this since our current retail book naturally opens as contracts expire and is also aligned with the reduction in available capacity as a result of environmental shutdowns. More specifically, we intend to exit the medium commercial and industrial or MCI and mass market retail channels as existing contracts expire, but we will continue to serve strategic large industrial and commercial customers as well as our governmental aggregation in polar channels as appropriate.","Our generation in hedging strategy including maintaining an open position of 10 to 20 terawatt hours annually is focused on reducing overall risk in our competitive operations while maximizing margins, EBITDA and creating value.","With respect to our generating assets, we have an exceptional fleet with the size and scope that provides flexibility to adapt to current and expected market conditions and environmental mandates.","I\u2019ll take a few minutes now to discuss these issues and opportunities within our fleet. With regard to the EPA\u2019s proposal issued in June, the regulating CO2 emissions from existing electric generating units, we continue to analyze and review the proposal with particular interest in the treatment of nuclear units.","The current proposal allows only 6% of existing nuclear generation to counter towards the reduction targets. However, I can assure you that each EPA will be receiving significant comments on this point. We will continue to monitor new details that emerge as the regulatory process evolves particularly with regard to how our state regulators design their implementation plan.","At this point, it\u2019s too soon to say what if any changes would be required at our coal fire plants. However, we are already on track to achieve a 25% reduction below 2005 levels and CO2 emission by 2015 as a result of plant retirements and investments in plant efficiencies we\u2019ve already made.","So how these rules ultimately are implemented and whether they are focused on CO2 emissions or driving other aspects of energy policy or largely determine what if anything we will need to do.","With respect to other environmental mandates, we have negotiated with PJM to continue operating Eastlake units one through three and Lake Shore 18 following the expiration of reliability-must-run or RMR agreements in September. We will now be in a position to operate these units until April 15, 2015 when the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule impose a stringent emission reductions.","During the post RMR period, these units will be operated based on market conditions and we will be responsible for all costs and receive all revenues. Having these units available through the winter should help to provide an additional hedge against extreme weather events next year.","We have also taken yet another look at how we can reduce our cost for mass compliance. Through our performance testing, equipment assessment and inspections, we have identified several additional opportunities for cost control and we now expect our total spend for mass compliance to be approximately $370 million which is down from our most recent estimate of $465 million. The spending is about evenly split between competitive and regulated units.","Turning to other generate matters, the PJM capacity auction for 2017 and 2018 which was held in May produced stronger results than last year. However, the prices were still not where they need to be to sufficiently support the type of generation resources needed to assure a reliable and diverse supply or essential electric service.","More specifically as to our company, our 2,400 megawatt, Bruce Mansfield plant, which is the largest super critical base load coal fire plant in Pennsylvania is fully equipped with scrubbers, SCRs and cooling towers and is critical to providing reliable electric service in ATSI, did not clear in the most recent auction and only partially cleared in last year\u2019s auction.","As a result, while we will continue to operate and maintain the Mansfield plant, we have decided to minimize capital expenditures at this site until we get the results from the incremental auction in September of this year and perhaps until after the PJM auction in 2015 or the 2018-2019 period.","It would take approximately two years to complete the new water treatment upgrades that are necessary for continued operation after the little blue run coal [ph] facility closures on December 31, 2016.","If market conditions are unfavorable, we are prepared to delay these projects, pushing out the timing of the capital expenditures and possibly impacting the nature and timing of the outage. We will continue to provide updates on Mansfield. However, at this point, our current assumptions include the cost associated with the incremental upgrades in the 2015 to 2017 period of approximately $200 million.","If the project is delayed, these costs will move to later periods. And I\u2019d note that we do not anticipate a material impact on EBITDA as a result of these potential actions.","Finally, at Beaver Valley, we are moving the unit two reactor head and steam generator replacement outage to 2020 from 2017. This change, which will not impact the safe operation of the plant, is possible given the condition of the facility.","Our actions with respect to MATS spending and delaying capital spending at Beaver Valley are a continuation of our cost control measures. The total capital savings from the MATS spending reduction, the deferral at Beaver Valley and other fleet-wide capital reductions is approximately $425 million over the next several years.","We believe these actions will not only put us in a position to be cash flow positive at our competitive business during the 2015 to 2018 periods, but also put our competitive business in a much stronger position to face current market conditions.","This morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2014 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share reflecting our expectations for the remainder of the year. We also provided incremental disclosures for our competitive operations in our fact book including the amount of capacity clearing in the annual PJM auctions as well as other details to support your efforts to model this part of our business.","We anticipate that this additional transparency will support proper valuation of our competitive operations going forward.","Finally, on the topic of proper valuations, we recognize that the market is assigning a discount that is likely due to a number of factors, some of which are within our control and some not. As we begin to get more clarity on external drivers, such as the ongoing REIT case in New Jersey for example and communicate our strategy as we transform the company, we anticipate this will provide better visibility into our growth prospects for the future particularly those related to our regulated utility and transmission operations.","Thank you for your support. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Leila.","Leila Vespoli","Thanks, Tony and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s start with a deeper dive into our competitive generation strategy. The strategy we are laying out today is straightforward. We will pursue the effective hedging of the majority of our generation resources with reduced risk, at the highest possible margins possible while leaving a portion of generation available to capture market opportunities.","We have already taken action to mitigate risks and create length in our portfolio by purchasing additional power and auctions during peak period as well as by buying outage insurance this summer, all of which we spoke about at our last earnings call.","Since then, we have allowed some attrition or our customer base and returned selected customers to polar service. Going forward, we intend to serve all existing customers through their contract term. But as Tony outlined, we will eliminate our selling and renewal efforts in MCI and mass market channel and to certain LCI customers. We plan to maintain our sales efforts and government aggregation primarily in Ohio through a polar load and focus on selective, strategic sales to LCI customers.","Looking at each of those channels, we intend to continue sales to government aggregation communities primarily when contract prices move with the market at the percent of the price to compare. These sales also have relatively low acquisition cost and margins are generally attractive.","With the polar channel, we have virtually no acquisition cost. We have the flexibility to make decisions at the time of each of auction as to the value of the loan. We also plan to continue selling to strategic large commercial and industrial customers where we have a significant relationship or where the customer had a very high load factor that is not weather sensitive.","Basically, these customers represent a wholesale type load, but include a modest retail margin. This menu of auctions provides us with considerable flexibility as we look to establish our hedging strategy.","And we are in a strong position given the hedges we already have in place for both 2015 and 2016 with about 54 terawatt hours and 28 terawatt hours committed respectively. These include our currently committed direct LCI, MCI and mass market sales book which tapers off through 2018, but with a significant drop staring in mid 2015. As well as the polar and government aggregation sales, a portion of which extends for 2019.","We expect that our level of sales to large commercial and industrial customers, polar and government aggregation would sell in at about 10 to 45 terawatt hours annually. Given our current committed, we expect to be in that range beginning in June 2015 and for the subsequent 12 month-period. In additions, we expect to use hotel sales to hedge our generation and potentially utility purchase power agreement. We view all these auctions as a hedging tool chest with considerable flexibility to adjust as market conditions dictate.","The charges associated with our decision to exit certain channels were $0.07 per share in the second quarter with an expected ongoing savings of about $90 million annually. Going forward, we may cover a portion of our sales commitment with purchased powers in various amounts based on the season, fleet operational plan and other considerations and amounts to be determined as appropriate. But we expect purchased power to be minimal going forward.","Our competitive generation fleet can generally produce between 75 and 80 terawatt hours per year with up to 5 terawatt hours of additional generation available from wind, solar and our OVEC entitlement.","Our updated EBITDA estimate for 2015 is in the range of $900 million to $1 billion and assumes a market forward power prices of just under $40 a megawatt hour as of mid-July.","In our fact lore [ph] which is available on our website, you will see that we have slipped our close and open position which will enable updating the open position on a mark-to-market basis going forward each quarter. In addition, we are also providing sensitivities with $1 a megawatt hour change in market prices changing 2015 EBITDA at roughly $28 million.","I\u2019d also like to note that we expect to provide at least 2016 EBITDA guidance at the annual EEI conference in order to provide longer-term transparency with respect to our competitive operations.","As we transform our competitive operations, we will focus on leveraging market opportunities as they present themselves with a diligent focus on risk management. As you can see, our FES team has done a great deal of work over the past quarter to reevaluate sales target and identity opportunities for cost control so that we can best position of our competitive business going forward. At the same time, our regulatory team has also had a productive quarter.","And I\u2019ll switch gears now to provide an update on current regulatory issue and the filings we made yesterday. Our Ohio ESP filing will provide electric service to our utility customers for a three-year term from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019.","We have named this plan, Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress, as it provides numerous benefits that support reliable electric service, uplift our customers from volatility and retail price increases and encourages growth and development of the State\u2019s economy.","A highlight of the plan is the Economic Stability Program which provides for rider to cover the cost associated with the proposed purchase power agreement between the Ohio utilities and FirstEnergy solutions.","The proposed PPA would dedicate the output of Davis-Besse, SAMA and a portion of OVEC for approximately 3,200 megawatt or an average of approximately 23 terawatt hours annually beginning in June 2016 and running through May 2031.","As designed, the utilities would sell this power into the market and net any revenues associated with these plants against cost, thereby serving as a type of rate stabilization mechanism protecting against volatility and retail price increases.","Importantly, the Economic Stability Program will not impact the Ohio utilities competitive bid process and retail customers will still be able to choose an alternative retail supplier for power supply.","Under Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress, base distribution rates would remain frozen throughout the term. A typical residential customer using 750 kilowatt hours of electricity per month could expect to pay an average of $3.50 more per month during the first full year of the Economic Stability Program. But as I\u2019ve described, customers would receive a credit on their electric bill if market revenues exceed costs as projected over time.","The current ESP is widely considered a success in terms of its ability to produce competitively priced electricity for customers to remain with our utilities for generation focus [ph] as well as to create a level playing field among suppliers competing to serve retail customers to choose a shaft. It was broadly supported by diverse groups representing various customers and other interested parties.","Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress builds on that successful platform. It will not change the amount of power procured through the auction progress or otherwise detract from the competitive retail markets in our region. Our Ohio utilities would continue to utilize competitively bid auctions to procure generation supply for our customers who don\u2019t choose an alternative retail supplier.","In addition, Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress delivers significant benefits to the State of Ohio by retaining local jobs, protecting local tax revenue and promoting economic development. It benefits Ohio utility customers through the safeguards from volatility and potential retail price increases. And it benefits FES by providing a top base source of revenue for approximately 25% of its generation output.","We have requested the decision respecting our plan by April 8, 2015, which we believe is adequate time for all interested parties to evaluate the proposal. This timeline also fits with our competitive generation hedging strategy and then it provides adequate time to redirect these megawatt hours to other available hedging opportunities should Ohio decline this opportunity. And provides adequate time for the polar auction for supplies starting June 1, 2016.","In Pennsylvania, our four operating companies are seeking to increase base rates to ensure continued service reliability improvement for the 2 million customers they serve. Our Pennsylvania utilities have maintained stable rates for many years through strict cost control measures and careful planning. The last base distribution rate increase for all four companies was more than 20 years ago.","If the proposed rate plans are adapted, customers will benefit directly through continued service reliability enhancement to the local distribution networks that deliver electricity to homes and businesses in our community. These enhancements build on our Energizing the Future transmission initiative which includes support for smart technologies and can help reduce frequency and duration of power outages.","The filing request approval to increase operating revenues by approximately $152 million at Met-Ed, $120 million at Penelec, $28 million at Penn Power and $116 at West Penn Power based upon fully projected test years for the 12-month ended April 30, 2015. As a result, rate case request would increase average monthly customer bills by approximately 11.5% at Met-Ed, 8.6% at Penelec, 8.7% at Penn Power and 8.4% at West Penn Power, which in all cases is substantially below the rate of inflation since the last case for each company. We expect a decision with the Pennsylvania rate cases in April 2015 timeframe.","We have provided more detailed summaries of both our Ohio and Pennsylvania filings in a letter to the investment community we issued yesterday after market close.","With respect to other regulatory activity, in New Jersey, the Administrative Law Judge close the record on our base rate case of June 30th and we expect his recommendation later this quarter and anticipate APU action on our case in the fall.","In Pennsylvania on June 5th, the PCE approved the amended smart meter deployment plan for our Pennsylvania companies allowing us to move forward with building the entire Penn Power smart meter system of 170,000 meters by the end of next year. We began installation last month.","And finally, on May 23rd, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that FERC\u2019s requirement that RTO to pay LMP to demand response that participates in wholesale energy market encroaches on the State exclusive jurisdiction to regulate retail market.","The court\u2019s decision was based on its finding that demand response is a retail product and therefore FERC does not have jurisdiction to regulate it in wholesale energy markets. The court\u2019s action in the case it takes an important step toward allowing wholesale energy market to begin functioning properly.","On the same day as the court\u2019s decision and before the May 2014 capacity auction results were announced, we filed a complaint at FERC citing the court\u2019s decision, asking FERC to pull demand resources out of the May 2014 PJM capacity auction.","The PJM capacity auction is a wholesale market, so the inclusion of demand response resources is inappropriate in light of the court\u2019s decision. Eliminating demand response as a compensated capacity resource would provide much needed uplift for essential physical generation and better allow the PJM capacity auction to work as originally intended.","In fact, in an analysis published last month, the PJM market monitor found that removing demand response from the May 2014 capacity would increase the clearing price in RTO from $120 a megawatt a day to $282 a megawatt a day.","I would like to thank you for your time. Clearly, it has been a very active and constructive quarter on both the competitive and regulatory front. And we will continue to position our competitive business for the future while ensuring the best possible regulatory environment for our company.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter.","James Pearson","Thanks, Leila. As I discuss our financial results, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report which was issued this morning as in available on our website.","Our second quarter operating earnings of $0.49 per share were in line with our expectations. These results compared to second quarter 2013 operating earnings of $0.59 per share.","While I will walk through the drivers of each of our business units in a minute, the major drivers included lower commodity margin at our competitive business and higher operating expense in our distribution business primarily due to increased maintenance and vegetation management cost.","On a GAAP basis, second quarter earnings were $0.16 per basic share compared to a loss of $0.39 per basic share in the second quarter of 2013. The special items that make up the $0.32 difference between GAAP and operating earnings can be found on page 2 of the consolidated report.","Let\u2019s turn to a review of the key drivers of operating earnings across each of our business segments starting with distribution. During the second quarter, operating earnings for our distribution business were $0.39 per share which compares to $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2013.","The decrease is largely due to our enhanced focus on maintenance and vegetation management work in the second quarter of this year. These activities together with a 56-day outage at Fort Martin Unit 1 resulted in a $0.05 per share in operating expenses compared to the same period in 2013.","Distribution operating earnings were also impacted by higher depreciation, pension expense and interest expenses compared to second quarter of 2013. The Harrison\/Pleasants asset transfer increased earnings by $0.01 per share and a lower effective tax rate resulting from changes in state apportionment factors, increased earnings by $0.02 per share.","Looking now at distribution deliveries, while operating earnings associated with deliveries were flat, the overall trend remains positive particularly regarding the continued steady improvement in our commercial and industrial sectors.","Total distribution deliveries increased by 175,000 megawatt hours or less than 1% compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Now looking at the mix of sales, milder temperatures resulted in a 2% decrease and deliveries through residential customers. Heating degree days were 6% lower than 2013 and 10% below normal. While cooling degree days were 7% below 2013 and 3% above normal. Adjusted for the impact of weather, residential sales decreased about 1%.","Sales to commercial customers increased 1% overall and were up nearly 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. And sales to industrial customers were 2% higher than the second quarter of 2013 driven again by shale activity as well as increased production from the steel and automotive sectors.","As we have discussed over the past several quarters, the overall trends particularly for commercial and industrial deliveries remain solid. In fact, over the past 12 months while weather adjusted residential sales have been essentially flat, commercial deliveries have increased 2% and sales to industrial customers are up nearly 3% reflecting four consecutive quarterly increases in each of those segments.","The industrial pipeline remains promising particularly with respect to shale-related activity and we remain cautiously optimistic that growth in this sector will continue to accelerate over the next several years.","Moving now toward transmission business, operating earnings were $0.15 per share which is a 25% increase compared $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was driven by higher transmission revenues resulting from revenue requirement increases at ATSI and Trailco following their annual rate filings that were effective in June as well as higher capitalized financing cost.","Let\u2019s now turn to our competitive business. Operating earnings were $0.03 per share for the quarter, which compares to $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Operating earnings were impacted by a lower commodity margin, higher investment income and lower operating and maintenance cost.","Commodity margin decreased operating earnings by $0.14 per share driven primarily by lower energy prices at the time the sales were committed and lower contract and wholesale sales volumes.","While unit prices benefited from higher capacity rates, they also reflect the adverse impact of generally lower energy prices. You will recall that market power prices fell significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Prior to the drop in prices, our 2014 sales book was 30% committed while 2013 committed sales were 60% committed. Therefore, more of our 2014 sales were committee at lower energy prices as compared to 2013. Our overall retail customer count decreased 100,000 to 2.6 million since June 30, 2013 and total channel sales decreased 1.6 million megawatt hours or 6%.","We were already taking steps to be more selective in our sales to the large and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers during the second quarter. And this strategy resulted in a 16% decrease in those channels compared to the same period in 2013.","Our total customer count in the LCI, MCI and mass market channels will continue to decrease as we implement the strategy Leila and Tony discussed earlier.","Total generating output from ongoing units decreased 1 million megawatt hours. This was driven by outages and derates at our super critical coal units during the quarter which offset higher generation at our nuclear fleet primarily due to fewer forced outage days compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Fuel and purchased power cost were lower in the quarter and commodity margin also benefitted from higher PJM capacity revenues, net financial sales and purchases and lower MISO and PJM transmission expense.","Additionally, O&M cost increased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily related to the lower retail and marketing related expense partially offset by higher outage cost at our nuclear and fossil plants.","Overall, we remain pleased for the continued solid performance of our transmission and distribution businesses during the second quarter and first half of the year. And we believe the strategies we have put in place in all three of our businesses will lead to strong, stable returns going forward.","As always, we will continue to focus on our core businesses with a commitment to operational excellence, financial discipline and predictable and sustainable growth opportunities.","Now, I will open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good afternoon.","Anthony Alexander","Hello, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Just on the transition of the portfolio, the retail portfolio, can you give us a sense of how quickly you think you\u2019ll arrive at sort of the optimal shape because obviously the sales ratchet down but you\u2019re saying you want to basically be out of MCI and mass market. So when the sort of FirstEnergy, new FirstEnergy retail book \u2013 when do we see that book?","Donald Schneider","Jonathan, this is Donny. You probably haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the fact book yet, but when you get a chance if you look at Slide 102, it will show a buy channel as those sales turn them out.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so we can \u2013 so there\u2019s a slide in that. I haven\u2019t seen that, you\u2019re right. So there\u2019s a slide in there which will kind of answer my question.","Donald Schneider","Yes, it\u2019s a good slide. It will show channel by channel, so you\u2019ll be able to see the MCI and the LCI, et cetera. Kind of generally speaking, maybe we\u2019ll probably hit our target volumes about first quarter of second quarter of \u201816.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then is it correct that given what you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going into this coming winter that you are still probably short in the same amount that you were going into last winter, but you purchased protection. Do I understand that correctly?","Donald Schneider","No, not at all, Jonathan. Again, I apologize that you haven\u2019t had the chance to look at the fact book, but you\u2019ll see a real good slide on Slide 101 that shows our length. We\u2019re actually about 500 megawatts long going into the winter. And that excludes our peaking capacity. So the simple cycle CTs and the oil CTs would lie on top of the 500 megawatt that we\u2019re already long. So we\u2019re in pretty good shape for the winter.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So I see, that one\u2019s like \u2013 that\u2019s a monthly look rather than an aggregate annual look?","Donald Schneider","Yes, that\u2019s month by month. And it reflects any outages and whatnot to fit our plan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I see that. Very helpful. On a slightly different topic that I did \u2013 I think I had the number correctly that you thought you would have in aggregate $425 million capital savings over the next several years.","Anthony Alexander","Yes, that\u2019s basically 2015 to 2018.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Is that savings of the money that you\u2019re just not going to spend because you found ways not to spend it or is this some of it saving and some of it deferral.","Anthony Alexander","Well, some of it obviously is deferral especially that related to the Beaver Valley Steam Generator and replacement project. Now that will move into the \u2013 probably a little probably a little in \u201818, more in \u201819 and 2020 when the project is that fully undertaken.","The MATS savings are in fact real. They\u2019re not moved around and much of it depends on what the nature of the other capital investments are. Some will be as you call permanent, some will be just moved depending on when outages are scheduled.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","How would the $425 million bread down between permanent and deferrals roughly?","Anthony Alexander","Well, one of the largest portions of the $425 million would be the Beaver Valley movement. And I think that was about $270 million of the $425 million.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you, Tony. And if I could just one final thing, did I hear right, you said, you would expect it to give at 2016 EBITDA guidance for the EI [ph]. Is the implication that you might go out further?","Anthony Alexander","I think that\u2019s the only way you can think about it. But right now \u2013","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No, I just want to make sure I heard that right.","Anthony Alexander","In focus [ph], I\u2019m trying to give you at least \u201816.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Anthony Alexander","Okay.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then can you give us any sense at all of what the \u2013 I think you talked about the implication for residential customer would be of the ESP of $3.50 for a month which I guess one could calculate a net revenue uplift, but then there\u2019s obviously commercial and industrial as well. How does the ESP change your look? Can you give us any aggregate sense of that?","Leila Vespoli","I do not have that really handy. It would be a kilowatt an hour charge, so over an average customer\u2019s usage. But I really can get that, but I don\u2019t have that readily hand now. I\u2019m sorry, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry for too many questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies, please proceed with your question.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Thank you very much. I was hoping that we could get you to elaborate a little bit on the sale of the generation from FES to the regulated companies. For instance, when we think about the revenue requirements, should we tie to sort of a book value number for those assets. And what would be the book value?","Leila Vespoli","So the way to think about it is kind of \u2013 if you go back in time, a regulated rate of return on rate base and O&M, so how one would have traditionally done it in Ohio. And that then is compared to what the market produces and net difference is either a credit of charge to customers. And that information is contained in the filing, although, I believe under confidentially.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Do you have like a book value number for those megawatts?","Leila Vespoli","No. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 if you think about it in terms of evidence in the case, it is evidence in the case but it is under confidentially agreement.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then in terms of the customers that are opting for this, do you need enough customers to sign up for all the generation output of these units in order for all of this to qualify? Or would this amount of generation be dedicated irrespective of the customer sign up?","Leila Vespoli","Okay. So it is a non-bypassable charge. So if you think of it, what\u2019s actually happening is the FES side of the house is selling all the output from these three plants to the utilities. The utilities are taking the output and selling it into the marketplace. They are paying the competitive side of the house, the cost base kind of the traditional rate base kind of return. And they are taking the money they get from the marketplace again netting it against what they paid the FES side of the house and would either be a charge or credit to customers.","So the power itself is not actually going to serve customers directly. It is acting as a rate stabilization mechanism. And over the 15-year term, it is predicted to produce savings for customers at $2 billion or $800 million net present value.","So over the 15-year term, it will be a huge savings to customers. And if you think about it from a competitive standpoint for something in Ohio, Ohio looks to be a competitive state. It does not at all harm competition in Ohio because the Ohio polar auctions will go forward just as they had in the past. They will procure exactly the same amount of power and suppliers can compete for customers in the same exact way they\u2019ve competed for them in the past.","So again, I don\u2019t believe it is going to affect competition or ability of suppliers to compete either retail or at the wholesale polar level, but it is giving customers $2 billion and stability going forward.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","And then can you remind us who are the key parties that you would look to \u2013 if you were to try and settle in Ohio, who are the key parties that you would need in the settlement?","Leila Vespoli","So in the past, we have been very successful in getting quite diverse support around our settlements. Industrial customers are generally the most knowledgeable about markets and have been the ones in the past who have been interested in this kind of thing. So we\u2019ll be looking to them.","Staff in the past had something \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s entirely similar to what we were putting on the table with respect to AP. I think there\u2019s very significant differences. What we have in our Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress and in particular the economic stability program that is very different from that which is in the AP case for one thing, the Powering Ohio\u2019s Progress deals with the economic vitality of the state, the jobs, the taxes in Ohio, these were plants that were originally built to serve Ohio customers.","And if market revenues didn\u2019t prove to be sufficient to keep these plants around, the transmission that would be needed to compensate for that would especially be allocated to the after loan [ph]. So it\u2019s something that needs to be thought of in terms of the overall dynamic.","So I think while I mentioned the staff and they might have had some concerns about remotely similar kind of agreements in the past, I think we bring something different here and I would look to them as a settling partly.","Retail suppliers is another entity. And again, since I don\u2019t believe this affects them, I would be hopeful that we could have positive discussion with them and then obviously, the Office of Consumers Counsel.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And my last question is, can you update us on the status of the nuclear sound leasebacks and are you including in your capital requirements a potential buyout of the nuclear leases when they come to you?","James Pearson","Yes, Paul, this is Jim. We\u2019ve reached agreement with a majority of our lessors. I think we only have 50 megawatts that we have not reached an agreement on. We have buyback of the significant portion of that already, so I think we only have about 150 megawatts left to repurchase. So we do have some anticipated capital outflow in the 2016-\u201917 timeframe for those outstanding megawatts.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much.","James Pearson","Okay, thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Thank you very much. I was wondering if you might take us through the drop in guidance for GAAP earnings and the increase in excluded items from the operating earnings.","James Pearson","Yes, Hugh, this is Jim. Our GAAP earnings, it changed by about $0.34 and it was made up of first plant deactivation. That was $0.12 and that mostly is a contract termination, a fuel contract termination. Our retail repositioning, that\u2019s about $0.11 which you saw some of that already incurred this quarter. $0.10 on mark-to-market which is just as positions expiring at this point and then we had $0.01 for trust impairments.","So that\u2019s what made up the change in our GAAP earnings of $0.34.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","And could you explain perhaps the plant deactivation? I didn\u2019t quite catch that. So you had a fuel contract that\u2019s made and that caused you to deactivate a plant or \u2013?","James Pearson","Oh no, I\u2019m sorry. That was just the termination of a fuel contract and it kind of relates to not eating as much of our fuel that we had under contract.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Understood. Because of prior deactivations, you no longer needed the supply?","James Pearson","That\u2019s correct.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Right, okay. And then I also would like if you wouldn\u2019t mind just a quick clarification of the comments around the Mansfield plant. I got a little bit confused there. I understood that the plant will continue to operate but that your minimized CapEx and in particular, you\u2019re going to defer a water treatment upgrade but that\u2019s not one of these do or die CapEx projects that would be required for continued operation or did I get that wrong?","Anthony Alexander","I think \u2013 Hugh, this is Tony. Let me kind of walk you through that. With respect to Mansfield, we\u2019re going to continue making the max spend that\u2019s required for continued operation of that plant. That\u2019s part of the game plan.","At Mansfield, however, Mansfield needs a new water treatment facility. It\u2019s about a $200 million facility. It will take about two years to construct that. Because the Mansfield ash disposal site closes on December 31, 2016, essentially that construction project must start no later than January 1, 2015 in order to assure us that we will have it available for continued operation of the plant beyond January 1, 2017.","So if we delay that expenditure, it will require us to time differently how we take the Mansfield unit down and when we take it down to accomplish what needs to be done from a water treatment standpoint.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Okay. But you would still be operating \u2013","Anthony Alexander","Does that help you?","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Yes, I believe it does. But you \u2013","Anthony Alexander","It cannot operate after December 31, 2016.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Cannot operate but it \u2013","Anthony Alexander","Cannot operate without the water treatment facilities.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Got it, okay, great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking \u2013","Anthony Alexander","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","How are you doing?","Anthony Alexander","Good.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really quickly on the hedge change, it sounds like it was a $90 million benefit that you guys saw annually from that. Could you just elaborate a little bit more about what that is? Is that income, is that \u2013 did I get it right?","James Pearson","Yes, Paul, yes, you got that right. That would be income.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Is that pretax or after tax? And when was that part \u2013","Anthony Alexander","Those are expenses.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, those are \u2013","Anthony Alexander","And what we\u2019re really looking at, Paul, that would be reductions in agent fees, personnel, overall operating costs because you\u2019re not running a retail operation any longer at the same extent that we are today.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","And when would that show up or to show up?","Anthony Alexander","Probably in the latter part of this year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Anthony Alexander","As we wind down the operations, it will smooth out over time to \u2013","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Is there \u2013","Anthony Alexander","So we\u2019ll see some of it this year, most of it next year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Is there any decrease in margin because you guys are taking less risk it looks like instead of derisking the hedging. Is that correct? I mean, is there any other offset that we should think about that or \u2013 I mean you can get back \u2013 I\u2019ll just follow up with you guys afterwards.","The second one that I really have for you guys is, is as you know, there\u2019s this thing called the Edgar principle when we have to deal with affiliated transactions. I know you guys know a lot more about it than I do. Does it apply to you, do you think in this case in the Ohio \u2013 the Power Ohio case? And if not, why not and if so, how do you solve it for it I guess?","Leila Vespoli","So we have a market base rate authority and we believe that the PPA is covered under that.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","So as a result of long term contract would be seen as a market transaction, is that what you mean, I\u2019m sorry?","Leila Vespoli","That is correct. So we would not need to be filing at FERC, so we would not have that review process occur.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, so FERC would not be reviewing this under Edgar.","Leila Vespoli","Right.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, with the $140 million decrease in FFO, it seems for 2014, we saw a decrease in the first quarter as well. Any trend there or is that just noise or what have you?","James Pearson","Paul, this is Jim. That decrease in FFO, that was attributable that fuel supply contract I talked about that we terminated. And the other portion was associated with the expenditures for our retail repositioning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, thanks so much.","James Pearson","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question will come from the line of Greg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, thanks very much. Thank you for all the information. On Slide 106.","Anthony Alexander","Okay, Greg. Now we\u2019ll all be flipping pages there.","Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Within the hedged EBITDA, the capacity expense is $150 million higher than the revenue. How much of that is offset in \u201816 if it\u2019s possible to say?","Donald Schneider","Greg, this is Donny. I think the best way to think about capacity revenue and capacity expense as it\u2019s laid out here is you really have to think about them as completely separate transactions almost.","The capacity revenue that we get is a result of bidding our units into the BRAs and into the incremental auctions. We would get that capacity revenue regardless of what we\u2019re doing on the retail side.","The capacity expense on the other hand is tied directly to what we do on the retail side. And the revenue that offsets that capacity expense is built into our retail rates.","Greg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","James Pearson","Okay, Greg, thank you. I\u2019d like thank everyone for joining us on the call today. If we didn\u2019t get to you in the Q&A, please call our IR department and we\u2019d be happy to get back with you.","As you heard today, we\u2019re making substantial progress towards our long-term regulated growth strategy in our transmission business. Our Energizing the Future transmission investment initiative is well underway and we are on track to complete the investments we have endebtified [ph] this year while laying the groundwork for future construction efforts.","In our distribution business, we now have active rate cases in four states including our proposed plan in Ohio that would help protect customers in the State from both potential market volatility and retail price increases.","At the same time in our competitive business, we are taking further steps designed to reduce overall risk while retaining the flexibility to capture future market opportunities.

At this time all, participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders.","We're making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult, but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our Competitive business.","Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call, so let's get started.","Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our Competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment.","On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results.","Looking at the full year, as you know, we had hoped to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year.","On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio.","Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our Competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our Competitive business.","In our Ohio EPS IV case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe.","The hearing is focused on the modified Rider RRS proposal that we filed in May, as well as the PUCO staff testimony, which proposed a Distribution Modernization Rider. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet.","Moving to other regulatory matters, you'll recall that in April we filed new rate request for our four utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6.","As always, we look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of Administrative Law and we are awaiting the procedural schedule.","In our Transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives and we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec Transmission assets into our new affiliate company Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This new standalone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers.","In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November.","Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of week power prices, the low capacity auction outcome in May, and an anemic demand forecast. As you know, last Friday we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136-megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate Units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $640 million, as well as coal contract termination and settlement costs of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units.","In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year, as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our Competitive segments.","We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carry-forwards, given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs.","Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last six years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatt of generating capacity, with most of these units closing within the next three years.","We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation, especially zero-emission nuclear and even coal, which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets to adequately value existing baseload generation.","At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and are focused regulated operations. And we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct.","We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further de-risk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states, including Ohio and New York.","We also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they are ready to address the generation shortfall included in Mon Power's integrated resource plan.","I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission, and distribution in a vertically-integrated or other type of fully-regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future.","And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from a balance sheet and cash perspective, including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units.","As I've stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated and our long-term goal is to operate as a fully-regulated utility company. We continue to expect our Competitive segment to be cash flow positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost savings given the current environment.","They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018, beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help offset the further erosion in power prices.","In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley unit two steam generator replacement from 2020 to 2023, given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our Competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance.","At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments, with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our Competitive business in order to support credit ratings.","As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit costs last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company on credit watch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future, which may result in non-investment grade credit ratings for those entities.","This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy Corp.'s metrics in line with our earlier disclosures.","And we remain firmly focused on positioning our company for success through a customer-focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.","As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pre-tax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of Units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on page one of the consolidated report.","On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all three segments. Earnings in our Distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit costs and lower distribution deliveries, associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015.","Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015, with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather-related usage was essentially flat compared to last year.","Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%, similar to last quarter. Continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year, based on our discussions with several large customers.","In our Transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI and TrAIL's annual true up to their formula rates, reflecting an adjustment to true-up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost, a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January, and lower capitalized financing costs. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL.","In our Competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues, driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy.","Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects six months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although, July has been quite warm across most of our service territory.","First, we'd like to point out that consensus estimates have a very wide range in 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA, along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus.","At the regulated utility business, we're expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share, with a mid-point of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather-normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million in our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program.","Ongoing expenses such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full-year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went into effect May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR.","Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector.","At our Transmission segment, we expect a slight up lift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI, up $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by ATSI's lower return on equity of 10.38% compared to 12.38% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015.","In the Competitive business, we have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 64 million megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt hours will remain open to market prices for the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the Competitive business is $850 million to $950 million.","Positive drivers include one less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program.","Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year, and increase pension costs and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At Corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015 combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver and term loan are the primary drivers.","Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp's balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program, which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program, as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and our financing plan. As Chuck said, we had a productive and solid first half, and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders.","Now I'd like to open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Shah Pourreza of Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, Chuck and Jim.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, clearly somewhat of a change in strategy around the merchant business and obviously you could tell from your tone that frustration has gone to a peak level here. When \u2013 I guess the first question is around the assets. Is there other assets you can sort of highlight that could be potentially rationalized? And then is there a point in time where you sort of capitulate with this business, either move it to non-core or even discontinued operations at this point?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first, I don't think there's been any change in strategy. I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus on regulated operations, and I have talked about that Competitive business as \u2013 obviously we own a merchants generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility-like, if you will, and I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June and while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot July and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working.","I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us, even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market.","And is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we're ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories, not being built to serve customers, that is very frustrating to me.","But nonetheless, I think we are doing the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time, and that's our goal, and that's kind of always been where we've been at.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the option side, I know AEP certainly talked a lot about restructuring legislation that they're going to be going after not reregulation but restructuring. And they did highlight that they're engaged stakeholders. So curious, is this sort of something that you're joining AEP with? Are you one of the stakeholders? Just some color there would be good.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, right now I think we've got a bigger issue in Ohio we're working on and I think it's important that we keep our regulatory and legislative and legal teams focused on that issue, and that's what we're going to do.","I'm aware of what AEP is proposing. I think it's a very creative approach. I think it helps solve some of the issues that we have with making sure we have reliable capacity going forward in the right places without having to build transmission on top of it, and I'm pulling for them. At the right time, we may join in with them in that effort, but at this point in time we're not actively involved in it. We're trying to get our ESP case done.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it, got it. And then just lastly, that's helpful, when you think about sort of your forward equity needs, not to right-size the balance sheet as a result of whatever happens with Ohio, but more from a growth perspective, should we just, going forward beyond 2016, assume 50%-50% cap structure on your transmission initiatives?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","From our side, we'll look at probably capitalizing the Transmission segments, where the rates are set at a 60% equity level. Initially MAIT, we will have it at a 50%-50% cap structure. Now, obviously at the holdco level of transmission, we will have a cap structure that's a little higher than that on the debt side. But that's how I would think about it going forward.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Excellent. Thanks Jim and Chuck.","Operator","Our next question Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good Morning.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good Morning, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to understand the \u2013 how you're looking at the investment-grade metrics for the company. Are we to think that \u2013 you're obviously going to keep the utilities investment grade. It seems like you're willing to let the merchant business go to sub-investment grade, but what about the holdco or the parent? Do you plan to keep that investment-grade alongside the utilities?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely and I said that in my prepared remarks.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then when we look to the merchant business, is it still free cash flow positive in the outer years with the latest capacity price print and just where the forwards are right now?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's cash flow positive through 2018 and we haven't talked to you about beyond that.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And if you were to require more capital just for the plants with CapEx, would a sub-investment-grade entity be able to access more capital? And would you look to access capital from the markets to fund the GenCo markets if it was needed? Or would you continue to find ways to basically rationalize the fleet?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll let Jim answer the question in detail, but I think we're confident we can raise whatever we need in order to keep that business going in terms of refinancing existing obligations. I do not see us leveraging that business more in order to keep it going.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, this is Jim, Neel. I'd agree with Chuck. As we said, that business is expected to be cash flow positive each year through 2018. We're coming through the end of our construction phase. We'll be done with most of our match expenditures. Mansfield dewatering facility will be completed. And as we said, we are going to move the refueling \u2013 or I mean, the Beaver Valley-2 steam generator and head replacement out to 2023.","In addition, we have a $1.5 billion credit facility at the competitive side that we have not used. So I don't think funding that business will be any issue. However, we are going to be very focused on the capital investments and we don't intend to make any investments, especially on the fossil slide, unless it's for safety or to preserve our options going forward.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And one last quick question. We're going to get hopefully the Ohio decision wrapped up in September and is the plan to kind of release the longer-term capital needs plan at EEI or is there an Analyst Day separate from that where you plan to do that?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say this. We are committed to telling you what this company looks like once we have the Ohio case done. If the timing works out for us to do that at EEI, then we'll do it at EEI. If the timing doesn't work out for that, then we'll have a meeting that's specifically designed around telling you the outcome and what it does to our company, whether it's an Analyst Meeting or how we do that, but yes, we're going to communicate that to you as transparently as we can.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director-Investor Relations","Before we move on to the next question could I ask that all of the analysts limit their questions to just one. We have a lot of people in the queue and I'd like for us to be able to get through to everyone today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys. So, just can I ask about the strategy on holding investment-grade of the parent, and you obviously have just reiterated that's a priority, and how we should view the $500 million of equity you're doing in 2016 in that context? And let's just say if you don't get some help, what you're looking for from Ohio, can you help us think about what that scenario looks like?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't think you should think about the $500 million. I mean we told you we're going to issue $500 million of additional equity this year. Jim mentioned, we've already invested over $3 billion in transmission growth capital with another billion planned next year. You all look at those numbers the same as we do. I'm not going to speculate on an outcome in Ohio right now. When we know that outcome, we will know what the impact it has on our credit ratings and then we'll do what we need to do. We've got a number of other strategic options that we can execute that we will, but I think it's premature to talk about what all of those could or could not be until we see where we land in Ohio.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Julien.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So I want to just clarify the necessary metrics you need to get to. What do the agencies tell you in terms of the 14% FFO to debt versus the 11% at Moody's and perhaps 12% at S&P? So just curious, to what extent does the current equity plan get you to something that keeps you investment grade? And also perhaps a further nuance to the follow-up I'll just ask now, is S&P potentially enabling a two notch difference between your holding company and your opcos?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, when we met them earlier this week, they told us, you guys all talk to them a whole lot more than we do. So I think it's pretty obvious out there what they expect us to get to. And in terms of how we're going to get there, I just said the Ohio ESP is a big piece of the puzzle that we have to get answered before we can talk about what the next steps of the puzzle are. I think it's likely that both of the agencies are going to publicly say what their expectations are here in the near future both for the Competitive business and for the rest of this company. But we're focused on keeping our investment-grade credit ratings at the holding company and for every one of our regulated entities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But said differently, just to be very clear about it, in terms of the metrics that you're targeting, are you and the agencies talking about a shift in the business risk profile? And are they ready to buy into that sort of in the near term, if you will?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Julien. This is Jim. I would think that the expectation is that we'd need to achieve a FFO at 14% at this point. And they would not be looking to change that in the near-term.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. And that's probably an eventual target?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","As Chuck said, we ultimately intend to be a fully-regulated company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But you can hit that FFO with the \u2013 depending what comes out of Ohio in this $600 million in equity?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. We can.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","We've got to wait and see what comes out of Ohio, as Chuck said.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just \u2013 on the credit rating, I mean, normally when I think of credit rating, I think of the senior unsecured credit rating as what sort of the focus counterparties have and what have you. And clearly, that's not what you guys are focused on, given that we already are at below investment-grade at the senior unsecured. Is there any concern about the senior unsecured? Or is it simply focused at the issuer level? And why the focus at the issuer level as opposed to senior unsecured, which is what I normally think of as being the metric that people are \u2013 that the rating that people are actually \u2013 the counterparties are focused on? Do you follow me?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we follow you. From our standpoint, we're not expecting that we're going to issue any more senior unsecured debt. So, I think the way we're looking at it, Paul, is we want to at least maintain where we're at right now. And our goal would be at the S&P level to get the corporate credit rating ultimately notched up one. That would also notch up our senior unsecured. From a Moody's standpoint, we are already at investment grade. So that's the way we're thinking about it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. And I guess that's my question. I realize you guys are time limited. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. I realize you're in a case in Ohio. The \u2013 can you talk about sort of the implications if the outcome ends up being something along the lines of the staff recommendations and how you would view that?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we just filed our rebuttal testimony and attempted to point out what we thought some of the potential things that the staff missed in their testimony might be. I think some of those are pretty obvious. And even the commission staff in their testimony agreed that there were adjustments that were made or need to be made to the initial number they came out with. So I'm going to answer this question the way I've always answered. I'm not going to speculate about things that we don't know about.","So we've got another couple of months to get through this case in Ohio. We've been waiting patiently for two years and three months to get to an outcome here. And with only a couple of months left, I'm not going to start guessing at what the outcome is. We're going to get the outcome. We're going to deal with that outcome, and then we're going to move forward and we're going to move forward in a way where we expect to maintain investment-grade credit for our holding company and all of our regulated entities.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Sorry to repeat the question. But Jim, that 14% target, is that the Moody's target or is that the S&P target or is that both?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","The 14%, that's the threshold that Moody's has designed. From our standpoint, we're targeting at 14.5% to 15% of FFO. But the 14% is Moody's.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And you're also expecting rate relief in Pennsylvania and New Jersey along with hopefully a constructive outcome in Ohio. So as we think about cash flows going into 2017 and beyond in the regulated businesses, you're making assumptions with regard to the improvement in cash flow from all three of those things, right...","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That's correct, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...the equity issuance to get you to that number?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, that would get us above the threshold that they've set. But again, our target is 14.5% to 15%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And that does not presume any further equity needs post 2016? Or that's sort of an iterative question relative to the total amount of rate relief you receive?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I think it's an iterative question. We'll continue to do the employee benefit program and stock investment program. But as Chuck said earlier, I think there's a big piece of the puzzle that still has to fall into place before we have any further consideration there.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. One last quick thing, the $500 million you're going to issue, is that going to be issued into the pension plan or would that be issued directly to the public?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","As we said, this $500 million that we expect to issue, we expect to contribute that equity to our qualified pension plan.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Chuck and Jim. I don't think you covered this earlier. Maybe you could give us color on the units that were shut at Bay Shore and Sammis or are targeted to be shut and kind of where they're running right now on a kind of earnings contribution and cash flow contribution basis.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","The units that we shut down or said that we were going to deactivate by 2020 was just Unit 1 at Bay Shore, the only unit we have, and it was Sammis 1 through 4 at Sammis. We've never disclosed what those would be from an earnings standpoint. But when you look at the total, including the capital that we would have to invest and the revenues net of their operating expenses, it will make us improve our cash flow going forward. And that's essentially the reason we decided to deactivate those units.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered, but what's the timing on the equity and have you baked July weather into your guidance?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","We have not baked July weather into the guidance. As I said in my comments on the script though, July was a very warm month and our plants ran very well. So, I would expect that we will have some weather improvement in July.","As far as the equity, we really can't comment on the timing of the equity transaction. However, I can tell you our earnings guidance is conservative and assumes dilution starts in the earlier part of the second half of 2016.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we've planned normal weather for the rest of the half \u2013 the second half of the year in our guidance numbers.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the 2016 guidance. Could you give us a sense, either specific or more high level, how you're doing against your kind of allowed ROEs in your key jurisdictions within the guidance in 2016? Are you kind of earning in line, are you under-earning a decent amount? Any help from that standpoint.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Steve, this is Jim. From my standpoint, I would say in all of our jurisdictions, we will be earning right in line with the authorized ROEs. And as you know, a few of the jurisdictions, they have what's called black-box settlement, where they don't come out and particularly say exactly where it is. But with the filing we have in New Jersey, the four utilities in Pennsylvania, where we are in Ohio that essentially covers all of our utilities with the exception of Maryland and West Virginia. And we just had the filing in West Virginia a little over a year ago. And Maryland, we're seeing some load growth there. So, I would say we're earning right in line with all of our ROEs.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, I'm sorry, I just want to clarify though because I was asking more specific to 2016, since we now have a base figure providing us for 2016. Since you're not getting the rate relief really by then in 2016, are you under earning a little bit, and then when you get the rate relief, you earn more in line? Are you \u2013 is the rate relief mainly for growth, so you're kind of earning in line?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","If you look in New Jersey, the rate relief is associated with our capital investments we've made since mid-2012. We've had about $600 million and some of investment there. So we're not earning on that capital right now. So, I would say we're probably slightly under earning there. In 2016, we would expect that we would have a decision in Pennsylvania by January 27. So our guidance would include earnings that would get us pretty near to what our ROE expectations are.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. My quick question on the generation business, is there any intention to ring-fence that business, to protect the ratings of the holding company and the utility from what happens at the generation side?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Praful, this is Jim. I would say, we're not looking at any type of new legal actions or anything to ring-fence that side of the house. The way you should look at it is, there's no cross defaults on any of the financings that we have out there or the credit facilities. FirstEnergy Corp. does guarantee about $1.25 billion on that side of the house. And it's really made up of about $1.2 billion of our underfunded pension, OPEB and EDCP cost. And then there's just about $50 million associated with some contracts that FES has. So, from my standpoint, there's no thought about ring-fencing. But that's just where we are with that side of the house.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. So just to clarify, if there is a strategic action like a sale or something further down the road, where not all the debt is covered, are you looking to \u2013 my question is are you going to support the debt or are you going to walk away from it from a holding company perspective?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I don't think that's something that we've been contemplating at this point. The business is still cash flow positive. We intend to make every effort to ensure that those assets continue to run. As Chuck said earlier, if we get to a point, we may look to deactivate or sell some assets. But I think that question is much further down the road. I was just speaking to what the guarantees are by the holding company.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just real quickly on the non-regulated side, your volume expectations. You all used to talk about volume of between about 80 million and 85 million, most from your generation, but also a little bit of purchased power. When I look at the guidance slides, it looks like it's a good bit light of that for 2016. Can you just \u2013 am I seeing that right? And can you just talk about what's going on a little bit?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Yes, Michael, this is Donny. Yes, we have pulled back a little bit. With where we're at with Sammis 1 through 4, we expect very little production out of those machines going forward. They'll still be available, but we see very little production coming out. So we've reduced kind of what we'll produce in the range of 70 terawatt hours to 75 terawatt hours. And that's very dependent on what the forward market does. And then we have about 5 terawatt hours that we purchased through wind contracts, OVEC, that sort of thing. So we'll produce about 75 terawatt hours to 80 terawatt hours going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, okay. I don't know if Irene will let me, but I'm going to try and sneak in a follow-up on West Virginia. Can you just talk about the time line for wind West Virginia, when Mon Power needs new capacity and some of the alternatives, whether it's building or buying combined cycle versus buying or transferring an existing coal unit?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Good morning. This is Leila. So we previously filed the IRP. It showed a need for generation going out a couple of years from now. But that case right now is concluded. So there is nothing that would, unless we were to file something, initiate something, that would come out of that case. So we would be looking as we go forward and continue to monitor the forecast for that company to see how we might want to present something consistent with the IRP in terms of bringing additional generation to Mon Power.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So there's no formal like RFP process that's about to kick off or that will be undertaken in 2016 or 2017?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Correct. There's no time line associated with that. We would initiate it when we believe it to be the appropriate time.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you. Just one question for Jim. The effective tax rate increase, 38% from 36%, can you give more color on that? And if my math is right, that's more than about \u2013 more than half of the $0.08 differential between 2016 and 2015 that you show on slide nine.","K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller","Yes, this is Jon. Most of the increase, we had some benefits that flowed through in the second half of 2015 that reduced the tax rate down to 36% and we don't expect that going forward. So, I would think that 38% would be a more normalized tax rate.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thanks. And then was my math right that, that's a big chunk of that $0.08?","K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller","That's right.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That is.","K. Jon Taylor - Chief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller","That's right.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thanks. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes in the line ever Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just to jump on the previous question, 2016 guidance holdco losses at $0.52, is that something I could carry forward post 2016 and where that \u2013 in that realm? I know you're not giving post guidance, but around $0.50 of holdco losses?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I would say that's a representative number. As you know, we have about $6 billion of debt at the holding company. Some of that is what I'd say variable rate debt. So, if you make an assumption that interest rates are going up, then you could see a change to that. But the biggest component is interest expense and about several billion is subject to variable interest rates. So, you could see a change in that if we had an upward movement in interest rates.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raymond Leung of RBC Capital markets. Please proceed with your question.","Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, Chuck. Hey, Jim.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ray.","Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC","A couple of questions. One, could you talk a little bit about the strategy of how do you bridge the gap to hit your credit metrics if you don't get a favorable ruling out of Ohio? And then could you also give us an update where you are maybe with Fitch? I think you guys were potentially looking at exploring a rating with them? And the last thing, any limitations aside from that guarantee from legally separating FES via some sort of a sale? Thanks.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll take \u2013 there were three questions in there. So, take the first one and that is, I've already answered it a couple of times here. We're not going to speculate about Ohio. There's a whole wide range of outcomes. The staff said one point. The corrections we made to the staff testimony got that number up in the over $500 million. I think we've got to let that process play out, see where we're at, and then we will take whatever steps we deem are appropriate to maintain our investment-grade credit for our holding company and our utilities. And those steps are so wide-ranging depending on the outcome for Ohio, it's just \u2013 I don't think it's good to speculate about them, so I'm not going to talk about them. I'll tell you what we know when we know it.","On the second question, Jim \u2013 I think Jim already answered it. We're not looking at doing anything to legally ring-fence our generation business. But as I said, we're not going to use any equity to support the credit ratings of that business. We're operating it in a fashion that's cash flow positive. And we're going to make whatever decisions that we need to make on a unit-by-unit basis to deactivate them, sell them in order to keep that business as positive of a member of the FirstEnergy team as we can.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And Ray, this is Jim. I'll take your final, the third question. Yes, Irene and her team, they continue to have discussions with Fitch about potentially reinstating the ratings. So I think we're having very good dialogue with them and we should be in a position to update you probably later this year.","Raymond Leung - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Much appreciated. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So there aren't any more questions on the board and we're running towards the end of our hour. So thank you all again. I know we had to make some very difficult decisions last week. Look forward to talking to you more about that part of our business when we see you all at EEI.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may begin.","Irene Prezelj","Thanks, Sherry. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with a presentation which supports today\u2019s discussion.","Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the Q&A session.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles Jones","Thanks, Irene, and welcome, everyone. Hot weather and strong operational performance across our company led to great second quarter results. Our earnings exceeded the guidance we provided to the investment community and I remain very proud of our FirstEnergy team\u2019s record of consistently meeting or exceeding the estimates we have provided to you over the last three-and-a-half years.","We\u2019re entering the second half of the year with tremendous momentum on our customer focused regulated growth strategy. Looking at the balance of the year, we are currently tracking near the upper end of our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share and we are pleased to affirm that range today.","For the third quarter, we are introducing an operating earnings guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We\u2019re also affirming our long-term operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2021. This includes the impact of the amended settlement agreement and the FES bankruptcy case to include the FES and unsecured creditors committee.","This final comprehensive settlement defines and quantifies all of FirstEnergy\u2019s obligations with respect to FES and FENOC and as a milestone development as we move forward as a fully regulated company.","I will touch on the significant updates to the April agreement and principle. You can find more details on these items along with other non-economic terms in the appendix of the Quarterly Highlights Presentation that is published on our website.","First, we will provide a credit for nine months of the 2018 shared services cost on behalf of FES above to $112.5 million. In addition, we have agreed to extend the right for FES to purchase shared services from the end of this year to June 30, 2020.","Second, we have increased the cash payment by $88 million. And third, we have agreed to cover certain FES the employee benefit related cost with an expected value of $18 million including a voluntary enhanced retirement program if offered by FES.","In terms of timing, we expect FES to file the agreement with the bankruptcy court by the end of August for approval in September. Reaching the settlement only four short months after the bankruptcy filing is a tremendous accomplishment and it represents an outstanding effort by a restructuring working group and everyone else involved.","In addition, by completing this effort squarely in mid-2018, we are fulfilling the commitment we made to you when we announced our timing to exit competitive markets. With the resolution of this milestone step in the bankruptcy process for FirstEnergy, we look forward to entering 2019 with our focus on the continued successful implementation of our regulated growth strategies.","Let\u2019s switch gears and discuss our second quarter results and other developments. In our distribution business, weather was the dominant driver but it wasn\u2019t the only positive development. In our Residential segment, we saw growth in both customer count and weather adjusted usage in the second quarter and we are hopeful these results signal an improving economy in our service territory. We also continue to see growing demand from our industrial customers, with their electric usage increasing by 2% marking the eight consecutive quarter of growth in that customer class.","Turning to regulatory activity. In New Jersey, severe coastal weather systems and Nor'Easters are a difficult reality for our JCP&L customers as well as our utility infrastructure. Recently our JCP&L team conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution system and assess lessons learned from restorations efforts following severe weather events.","From that analysis, we developed JCP&L Reliability Plus an infrastructure investment plan that is designed to improve customer service by reducing that frequency and duration of power outages for our New Jersey customers, particularly those related to severe weather.","This four year, $400 million plan was filed with the BTU last month. These targeting incremental investments include nearly 4,000 enhancements to help the reliability and resiliency of JCP&L\u2019s overhead and underground distribution lines. New equipment to minimize outages and additional tree work to reduce the impact of storms. We requested BTU approval by the end of the year.","In Maryland, later this month, we plan to file the first base rig case for Potomac Edison in nearly 25 years. The request will address the impact of federal tax reform on customer rates as well as recovery of investments made in our Maryland distribution system to ensure continued safe and reliable service.","In Ohio, our application for a $450 million distribution platform modernization fan is pending at the PUCO. As we have discussed, the three year plan seeks approval to redesign and modernize portions of our distribution system which will help our Ohio utilities restore power faster, strengthen the system against adverse weather conditions, and enhance system performance by allowing remote monitoring of real-time grid conditions.","In our transmission business, in May, FERC approved our settlement agreement establishing a forward-looking formula rate for MAIT, with an implementation date for new rates of July 1. Our customer-focused Energizing the Future program is driving significant improvements in the performance of our transmission infrastructure.","Since 2014, we have completed between 600 and 700 transmission projects per year. These have been focused on upgrading or replacing aging infrastructure, building a smarter, more secure transmission system and adding operational flexibility, so grid operators can quickly adjust to changing conditions in the grid.","We have replaced or rebuilt more than 1200 miles of transmission miles across our service territory and we have a rigorous process in place to continue identifying projects that can reduce transmission outages and enhance reliability for our customers.","In four years since we\u2019ve launched this program, these efforts have resulted in a 37% reduction in transmission equipment related outages in our ATSI zone, which services our Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating, and Toledo Edison utilities in Ohio, as well as Penn Power customers in Western Pennsylvania.","We remain on track to invest more than $1.1 billion dollars this year on transmission upgrades, growing to $1.2 billion dollars per year from 2019 through 2021. As we continue expanding the program eastward, we fully expect to achieve similar results in our MAIT region, which encompasses our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas in Pennsylvania.","In addition to our strong progress in these regulated growth strategies, we are making headway in our efforts to align our cost structure and workforce for the future, through our FE Tomorrow initiative. In June, we offered voluntary severance and early retirement packages to approximately 600 employees, predominately in our Shared Services organization, which in-groups such as IT, communications, finance, and legal.","The offers were accepted by nearly 500 individuals. These employees will begin departing this month, with most retiring by the end of the year. In addition, in July we extended the retirement package to eligible members of our executive team, with Jim Pearson & Leila L. Vespoli both accepting their offers. Leila will retire on April 1, 2019 and Jim will retire no later than that date.","I\u2019d like to personally thank Jim, Leila, and all the other employees who are retiring from our company for the many valuable contributions they\u2019ve made over their careers. These departures roll into our FE Tomorrow initiative where we continue our work to identify the optimal organization and properly align our corporate costs and systems to support our efficient, regulated growth company going forward.","While we don\u2019t have any financial projections related to FE Tomorrow to share with you yet, we expect that the initiative will offset the nearly $30 million related to depreciation for common systems shared with FES, which we previously disclosed in our guidance. We expect to be in a position to provide more details on these activities during our third quarter call. But a great first half of the year, and we are committed to executing the plan we\u2019ve already laid out.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for a review of the quarter and other financial developments.","Steven Strah","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported very strong second quarter results. Our GAAP earnings were $0.28 per share and our operating earnings were $0.62 per share. This succeeded the top end of our second quarter guidance.","As a reminder, to provide you with a comparative view of our performance, we continue to present all of our operating results and projections on a fully-diluted basis in light of the January equity issuance. This allows us to show all of the preferred shares as fully converted and excludes the impact of conversion timing.","While it does not impact our presentation, I\u2019ll note that preferred shareholders did begin to convert these shares in July. You can find reconciliations and other detailed information about our results in the second quarter consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website.","Before we move into operating earnings drivers, I\u2019d like to point out a couple additional special items. First our GAAP results include costs associated with the redemption of long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company. You\u2019ll recall that we used the proceeds from the sale of the Bath hydroelectric plant, which closed during the quarter, and the earlier sale of gas-fired plants to redeem this debt.","And second, GAAP earnings results include a $0.17 per share benefit related to two regulatory actions. The first of those actions, FERC approved a settlement that reallocated previously incurred costs of certain transmission projects across utilities in PJM which will result in a refund to our Ohio utilities. This benefited our second-quarter GAAP earnings by 10%.","The second action. In the wake of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding costs incurred to secure renewable energy credits in Ohio, we recognized a $0.07 per share benefit from the reversal of a reserve recorded in 2013.","I\u2019ll note that the accrued carrying charges on the balance were also reserved -- reversed but were not included as a special item because that expense was always part of our operating earnings. This appears as a $0.03 per share benefit to operating earnings in our Distribution business and was not part of our original guidance.","Now moving on to other key operating earnings drivers in our Distribution business. Earnings benefited by $0.09 per share from stronger distribution revenues associated with higher weather-related usage, increased industrial load, and a true-up of previous deferrals resulting from rate orders that were issued in the second quarter of 2018.","Cool temperatures in April followed by hot weather in May and June resulted in a 4% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to last year\u2019s mild second quarter. Sales to residential customers increased 8.6% while commercial deliveries increased 1.6%. Heating degree days were 33% higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 5% above normal while cooling degree days were 22% higher than 2017 and 30% above normal. On a weather-adjusted basis commercial sales were down 1.4% but residential sales were up 1.4%.","As Chuck said, we saw growth in both residential customer count and weather-adjusted average usage. We are cautious about reading too much into the short-term improvements but nonetheless we\u2019re encouraged by these results.","Another bright spot is the industrial sector where deliveries increased 2%. We have now recorded eight consecutive quarters of sales growth with a one year growth rate of 2.3%.","In our Transmission business earnings continued to benefit from our Energizing the Future investment program including a higher rate base at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries and higher revenues at JCP&L.","And in our Corporate segment, second quarter results reflects slightly higher interest and operating expense. This was offset by increased commodity margin at the Pleasants Power Station driven by higher wholesale prices due to hot weather this quarter. We continue to expect the earnings contribution from Pleasants to be insignificant for the year.","I\u2019d also like to share this brief update on where we stand with regard to passing tax reform savings onto customers. As you know, on January 1, we began deferring the full amount into each jurisdiction as a net regulatory liability as we work through the regulatory process.","In our utilities, we delivered customer savings in New Jersey on April 1 and in Pennsylvania on July 1. In Maryland, we plan to address tax reform in the upcoming rig case filing. In Ohio, we delivered customer savings related to various writers and we continue to work with regulators in both Ohio and West Virginia to determine next steps regarding the balance of tax reform.","In our Transmission business at ATSI, TrAIL, and MAIT, rates will automatically be lowered in connection with the normal formula rate process. And for the Allegheny transmission assets, we filed a proposed 6.7% reduction to stated transmission rates during the second quarter which is pending before FERC. We\u2019ll need to keep you updated on our progress.","So clearly, we\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance and operating performance during the quarter for the first half of the year. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our commitments to the investment community and the implementation of our regulated strategies. And we\u2019re positioning our company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth to benefit our shareholders, customers and employees.","So I do want to make a correction. The special item related to the FERC settlement helped our GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share. I misspoke when I said 10%. My apologies.","Thank you for your time. And now let\u2019s take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and on the settlement.","Charles Jones","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Gordon","You reiterated your short and long-term earnings guidance notwithstanding the increase in the agreed-upon remediation to the debtors and the creditors at FES. You know is it that there\u2019s some offsetting aspects of better performance in your core business that eat through that potential incremental cash out flow? Or is it just simply that it\u2019s bounded by the range that you\u2019ve already articulated?","Charles Jones","I would say it\u2019s just simply bounded by the range that we already had articulated, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thanks. My second question is a bit off the beaten path, but I think pretty important. You\u2019re going to be cleaned up sort of across the Rubicon [ph] here on separating from FES later this year. The dividend was cut from $2.20 a share to $1.44 a share several years ago. It\u2019s been unchanged since then.","The payout ratio I\u2019m looking at on your earnings growth aspirations would seem to indicate there was some opportunity for consideration of resuming some type of dividend growth. At what point will you bring to the Board for their consideration a change in the dividend policy?","Charles Jones","I think as we get this separation done, I will be having conversations with the Board. But I think it\u2019s too early to go there. But clearly I think if we\u2019re going to be expected to be valued as a fully regulated company, we\u2019re going to have to have a dividend policy that matches what other fully regulated companies do in the very near future.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So not right away, but at some point in the near future?","Charles Jones","So that would get this FES fully behind us, which we \u2013 this was a huge milestone, and it gives us the ability to now quantify what the fully regulated company looks like going forward. And that puts me in a position to have more meaningful discussions with the Board than we were able to have up until now.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, Chuck. Didn\u2019t mean to put the cart before the horse, but just getting a little excited on you resolving all this stuff. Take care.","Charles Jones","We\u2019re excited too.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Charles Jones","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","I just wanted to touch on you FE Tomorrow update, very positive update. Again, maybe this falls on the cart before the horse category too but you mentioned in your remarks that you expect the initiative would offset the $30 million in depreciation for common systems.","As you look at the scope of possibilities around continued cost cuts, is that the general ballpark level we should be thinking about or is there a series of initiatives that could significantly exceed that $30 million?","Charles Jones","Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say. We started planning for this exit over a year ago with that feed tomorrow. We had a lot of that groundwork done in advance. We\u2019ve obviously implemented this voluntary early retirement program to facilitate that. We\u2019re working through re-designing our entire corporate structure to fit what we need to be a regulated utility business going forward. That\u2019s a work in progress.","It\u2019s going to result in savings but we\u2019re not ready to communicate what that total amount means and how it\u2019s going to look going forward. Internally, there are lots of people involved and we\u2019re taking into account the feelings and emotions and everything else that goes into what we\u2019re putting this corporate structure through right now. At the appropriate time, we\u2019ll tell you what the financial impacts are.","Stephen Byrd","Totally understood. And then at a high level just thinking about your financing plan, you\u2019ve laid out some incremental CapEx opportunity so I just wanted to level set and check in again in terms of just making sure I understand how you would approach financing incremental CapEx needs to the extent that you do get approval?","Steven Strah","Steve, this is Steve Strah. So from a financing plan perspective, we would use internally generated cash flow as well as debt issued at the utility. So we have no incremental equity needs through our planning period through 2021.","Stephen Byrd","Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Chris Turnure","I appreciate the details on the tax reform process especially in the appendix that you provided today but I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the process in Ohio right now where you stand on the tax benefits outside of the writers and if you\u2019re deferring them currently and what the next steps are.","Steven Strah","This is Steve. Thanks for the question. We continue to work with regulators and staff in Ohio. We are currently deferring the full impact of the number of tax savings dollars there beyond the writers that we\u2019ve already trued-up. So we\u2019re working with them just as other utilities are working with them through the process.","And once again, we\u2019re following the lead of regulators also in West Virginia, as an example, where we have filed as asked and we\u2019ll work through the process with them.","Chris Turnure","And is the process in Ohio going kind of as you expected it to go at this point?","Steven Strah","I think we\u2019re within the expectation level that we had. It\u2019s a two-way dialogue. It\u2019s very clear that we\u2019ve returned roughly $40 million through the writer process for the DMR and DCR writers. The remainder is to be worked out.","Chris Turnure","Great. And then separately for the distribution business this quarter, I think you were clear that you guys did include a $0.03 benefit from the Ohio decision and adjusted EPS. But were there any other items that were nonrecurring or unusual in nature and adjusted EPS for the distribution business. And then I was also hoping you could quantify weather versus normal and a normalized load growth impact on an EPS basis as well.","Steven Strah","There were no other onetime adjustments to the quarterly earnings. The weather impact was about $0.03 compared to last year.","Chris Turnure","And did you guys have that on a versus normal basis as well?","Steven Strah","The total weather adjusted experience that we had is roughly 1% above normal when you look at it on a year-to-date basis.","Chris Turnure","Okay. But for the quarter specifically, we don\u2019t have the EPS impact of weather versus normal or normalized load growth versus normal?","James Pearson","Yeah, Chris. This is Jim. We were about $0.03 to $0.04 higher associated with weather during the quarter.","Steven Strah","This is Steve again. As I said in my open remarks, we had a cool April, but we had a very warm May and June that got us to that $0.03 number.","Chris Turnure","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Claire Huang with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. I\u2019m slipping in for Julien here.","James Pearson","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the great update. I just had two quick questions, not necessarily on FES here. The first is in terms of ROEs in Ohio. So they\u2019re trending upwards. Just wanted to confirm any details about the seat test and your thoughts there.","James Pearson","So, as of this point in time, we have not even triggered the first threshold under the seat test. So, I think all is good with regard to ROEs in Ohio for the moment.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Got it. I know this is a little forward-looking, three is a change in the commission potentially with the election, just want to get your thoughts on the seat test going forward, if there\u2019s anything you can say now or this is much more far away of a topic.","James Pearson","That is way forward-looking and I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s, I think probably there are some commissioner spots that are coming due next year but we have no idea who the governor is going to be at this point. It\u2019s too premature to even think about that.","Steven Strah","With regard to the seat test, the seat test is statutory, so that is not something the commission is allowed to just ignore.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s fair. Okay. And then my second question is just, I noticed you didn\u2019t have any commentary on the nuclear assets. I know that since you guys are totally out of FES now, that it\u2019s not really related to your ongoing business, but just curious if you have any thoughts on support for those nuclear assets and your thoughts there.","James Pearson","So, any thoughts around the future of those assets are now questions to be posed to FES. I would say that from my perspective, I continue to feel that that the market policies in our countries have severe flaws, that closing perfectly good nuclear plants in the long run is not going to be a good thing for our country.","In the long run, it\u2019s not going to be a good thing for the six million customers that I\u2019m paid to look out for. Because I think you know having a diverse mix of generation provides the most secure future for those customers from both a physical security, grid resiliency, and an economic stability perspective.","So, to the extent my voice matters in this process, I\u2019m going to continue to be a loud advocate for it. I do believe that the Department of Energy is still very seriously looking at this issue and we\u2019re hopeful that they intend, that they will eventually step forward and do something to stabilize it.","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed.","Andrew Weisel","Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations to Jim and Leila. I want to quickly first follow up on the comment about no incremental equities through 2021. Was that meant to indicate that your internal cash flow and small inclement to leverage would be a limiting factor on CapEx?","So, in other words if you were successful, it would be the approvals for the Ohio DPM, the New Jersey IIP, potentially some transmission projects. Would you not spend if you needed equity or would you raise equity if those opportunities came up?","Steven Strah","This is Steve again. Our forecast, with or without, those capital programs, we would generate enough internally generated cash flow and be able to fund the difference in debt issued at our regulated companies.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarifying. Next one, given the strong start to the year so far and little bit of help from weather, do you see any opportunity to maybe accelerate from O&M from P19 into 2018. Is that part of why you didn\u2019t raise guidance for the full year?","James Pearson","No, we didn\u2019t raise guidance for the full year because we\u2019re halfway through the year and a cold August and a warm December would result in reversing everything that we\u2019ve seen. So, I think I\u2019ve said before I\u2019m not going to take credit for good weather but I\u2019m also not going to plan on it either.","So, you know, we are on track with our plan as we laid it out for 2018 with basically the only difference being the Supreme Court ruling and the weather in this quarter.","Andrew Weisel","Understood. And lastly, just to clarify, given the progress made with FES and the settlements, should we think of the restricting working group as basically done at this point or is there anything more that they\u2019d be working on that we can be looking for to updates on?","James Pearson","I would say you can think of it as basically done, but not done. We still have work to get definitive agreements in place and get the courts to approve it. But I\u2019m not planning to use the restructuring working group to advise me on anything but the bankruptcy.","Andrew Weisel","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed.","Charles Fishman","Good morning, Chuck. A couple years ago, when you first started your appeal about the importance of the three nuclear plants, you know notwithstanding the grid reliability, and resiliency issues. One of the arguments you made was that the closure of those facilities would require material investment in the transmission system.","You now moved the upper end of your transmission guidance for 2019 through 2021. I think the guidance was just the unlocking the future slides this year, does that, have you started including anything in there or are you going to wait until we get closer to the retirement dates that FES has set or could that go higher I guess is my question.","Charles Jones","I'll go first. I\u2019ve talked generically about the costs that are imposed on the transmission system when existing power plants close. Generally that\u2019s not around the nuclear plants though. The nuclear plants are very heavily networked as a result of the need to ensure multiple sources of off-site power for reactor coolant.","So the nuclear plants themselves don\u2019t generate a lot transmission costs. I\u2019ve spoken about the costs we did incur when we closed the Lake plants and as well as costs that have occurred throughout the markets as other power plants have closed.","But inside our plan we include all of the RTEP projects that PJM identifies for our footprint. And those go up and down each year but they are included within our plan. So I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any significant change from the $1.2 billion that we talked about over the next four years after this year.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah. Good morning. So just the shared services agreement with FES that you \u2013 they have a right to extend, is that something where it\u2019s pretty much done at your cost so you don\u2019t have to worry about \u2013 it\u2019s not an issue for FE if it\u2019s extended?","Charles Jones","That is correct. Our financial ties to FES will end this year so that we can focus being a fully-regulated company starting in 2019. Any shared services that they may want after that they will pay for at the appropriate costs.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. And then just the Potomac Edison, what kind of returns \u2013 and I might have missed an answer in this but what kind of returns has that subsidiary been earning?","Leila Vespoli","So that subsidiary, this is Leila, has been earning returns in the 5.6% range and so obviously rate case we are seeking to put that in a proper place, which is also the reason we are hoping to take care of the tax issue associated with that because we\u2019ve been underearning for a substantial period of time.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Praful Mehta with Citi Research. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Chuck Jones","Hi.","Praful Mehta","So well congrats on further movement on the FES settlement. As that movement happens and as you clean up the purely regulated story, just want to understand from a strategic perspective how you\u2019re thinking about your story. Do you feel like you have the right size?","Is there any need to increase or decrease operations? Just as I look at your portfolio today, your I guess portfolio post-FES, anything from a strategic direction perspective that we should be thinking about?","Chuck Jones","From a strategic direction we\u2019re committing to 6% to 8% growth over the next four-year period and beyond that, there\u2019s nothing that I would comment on. I would just say any inquiries we would take seriously and look at and we\u2019re going to always do what\u2019s right for our shareholders but strategic plays for growth in this industry today are very complex especially if you take a company like ours where we have five regulatory jurisdictions so that would imply six or more likely regulatory jurisdictions.","They\u2019re just very complex and right now I think we\u2019re just focused what we\u2019ve said. We\u2019ve had 6 million customers across five states, 10 distribution utilities, three transcos [ph] and now we\u2019re looking at how we deliver the value that our shareholders had been asking for from us starting in 2019 and then well into the future.","Praful Mehta","Fair enough. That\u2019s good color but as you look at any opportunities that do come your way, how should we think about the criteria apart from obviously getting the right premium, the right returns for shareholders? Are there anything else that we should be thinking about as you kind of evaluate these opportunities?","Chuck Jones","I have no comment, Praful.","Praful Mehta","All right. Fair enough. I at least tried. I guess one more specific question on the economic lease of Pleasants. As a part of this restructured settlement, just wanted to get a little bit more color for this economic lease by FES or Pleasants beginning no later than January 2019. Can you just provide a little bit more color on that?","Chuck Jones","It fulfills what I\u2019ve said earlier that starting in 2019 any financial exposure to the commodity markets is gone and the financial lease for Pleasants will move all of that to the FES creditors.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, just curious. How are you thinking about where you are in the transmission investment cycle? Meaning the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion range. Do you kind of view that as kind of a long-run normalized run rate?","Or do you think \u2013 and if you don\u2019t mind \u2013 maybe touch on the specific geographies. Is there an uptick coming in one of the geographies, a downtick coming in others? You talked a little bit about this over the years but just kind of curious trying to get your multiyear view on where transmission been hedged.","Chuck Jones","For the next two years, it\u2019s going to be $1.2 billion. It was $1.1 billion this year and $1.2 billion for the next four years. We are moving it around our system. That\u2019s the clear benefit that we have of having a five-state territory with almost 25,000 miles of transmission.","We can move it around. I\u2019ve talked about the benefits already at 37% reduction and equipment related outages on our ATSI system. That\u2019s a direct result of the investments we\u2019ve been making. We\u2019re now moving more into the make [ph] part of our system and I\u2019m sure down the road we\u2019ll look at the Allegheny transmission that is in currently still instated rates and see if it makes sense to move to a forward-looking transco [ph] for those.","But I think for now, for the next four years, it\u2019s going to be $1.2 billion. We\u2019re doing 600 to 700 projects a year and we have to be cognizant of the execution risks. And as I\u2019ve talked before, there\u2019s not an unlimited workforce out there in our country today for transmission line and substation projects given that a lot of our other peers are focusing on this area too.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And one quick follow-up. If you think about the next three to five years and what may be on your long-term regulatory wishlist, meaning is there a state in your various service territories where you think there\u2019s opportunities to upgrade or improve the regulatory mechanisms that would A, potentially increase investment in that state, distribution, whatever, and B, help reduce to the lag that impacts your company?","Chuck Jones","Well I don\u2019t have anything specific to talk about but clearly we have a good track record of working our regulators to come up with different mechanisms other than traditional rate-based type of rate making. So whether those are writers or formulas or trackers in Pennsylvania.","We have that as IIP in New Jersey as a helpful addition to how we do business there. We\u2019ve had the DCR in Ohio. And so anything that is [indiscernible] to investors so that you understand when we\u2019re making investments what the returns are for you. That is constructive for customers. And obviously if we can reduce flag [ph] all of those are goals that we would like to achieve.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from -- we do not have another question, I\u2019m sorry.","Charles Jones","Okay. Well, thank you, all. As I said earlier, this settlement is a big milestone in our evolution to be in a fully regulated company. We thank you for support and I look forward to seeing you all in between now and the third quarter call and then talking to you again at the third quarter. Take care.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy. Thank you, Miss Beringer. You may now begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thanks, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.","Participating in today\u2019s call are Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now I will turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Chuck Jones","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to report another solid quarter for FirstEnergy. Last night we reported third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share, which is $0.06 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. As Jim will discuss in greater detail, these results reflect a solid performance across all three of our business segments.","Based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we\u2019re raising and narrowing our full year 2015 operating earnings guidance to a range of 267 to 275 per share from our previous range of 240 to 270 per share.","This is shaping up to be a great year for FirstEnergy and as we look forward to 2016, our employees can be proud of what they\u2019ve achieved. In addition to strong earnings, we have made tremendous progress on key initiatives that can provide us with greater strength and flexibility as we work to achieve our future goals.","So far this year we have clarity on the results from two of these initiatives. The cash flow improvement project and PJM capacity market reforms and we continue to make progress on the third initiative, the Ohio ESP.","As we discussed in July, our cash flow improvement project exceeded our initial target and should generate at least 240 million in cash flow improvements by 2017. That project would solicit cost savings ideas from across the company is rolling out as we expected and we remain fully on track to capture the 58 million in cash flow improvements identified for 2015.","Overall, this effort is not only establishing a new cost structure for the company. It has also helped us to initiate a culture change around spending. Employees continue to provide suggestions for meaningful and sustainable ways to reduce our cost structure, which could drive modes incremental savings going forward on top of what we have already communicated.","We\u2019re also cautiously optimistic capacity market reforms that are now in place at PJM. Results from the base residual and transitional auctions held in August and September were in line with our expectations. With the pay for performance model resulting and clearing prices that come closer to reflecting the true operating costs of our generating plans.","You\u2019ll recall that we raised our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for our competitive business in September as a result of the higher capacity and all of our uncommitted generation clearing the transitional auction for the 2016, 2017 delivery years. And we are reaffirming that range. We\u2019re also raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance based on our year-to-date results and the impact of our cash flow initiative.","While Jim will provide more of the details about adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business in a few minutes, I wanted to take a moment to address our current thinking about 2017. All of our uncommitted generation cleared the 2017, 2018 transitional auction as well. But as you know our proposed purchase power agreement Ohio would impact generation sales for seven months in 2016 and the full year of 2017.","So while we consider providing an adjusted EBITDA range for 2017 on this call, we ultimately decided that we do not have enough information yet to offer a constructive view. We remain committed to being transparent and we intend to provide you with this outlook once there is more clarity. With that said, we\u2019re pleased that the combination of our cash flow initiative and PJM capacity revenues from recent auctions will further strengthen the overall cash flow position for our competitive business.","And you\u2019ll recall that we already expected that business to be cash flow positive through at least 2018, prior to the incremental benefits of these two initiatives. Many of you have asked if we intend to shut down additional shut down additional plants. I tell our employees, we\u2019re working hard to ensure all remaining generation remains viable. The results of the Ohio ESP and future auctions will give us a better understanding of the longer term outlook on our at risk space [ph] little power plants and we continue to consider fuel and transportation contracts as well as environmental matters such as the EPAs Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in August.","We are particularly interested and that rolls treatment of existing nuclear generation, state specific emission reduction targets, the compliance time line and state flexibility. While we are advocating for an interpretation that allows for a thoughtful engineering based approach to ensure reliable energy resources for our customers, we will not have full clarity on the rules impact until state implementation plans are submitted, which could be as late as 2018 and then approved by the EPA.","To ensure that our critical base little power plants continue operating and to help safeguard our customers against price increases and volatility, we remain committed to our Ohio Electric Security Plan. The evidence you\u2019re already hearing for the ESP began August and rebuttal testimony was filed last week. We currently expect a decision by early 2016 and we continue our discussions with the PUCO staff and other parties to reach a positive outcome for our Ohio customers.","In fact you may have noticed that Leila is not on the call today. She is in Columbus, working on the ESP as we speak and I think that\u2019s where we would all rather have her. Once we have an outcome in Ohio, we have the information necessary to more fully assess FirstEnergy\u2019s earning for 2016, regulated growth in future years as well as our cash flow over the next several years. As we\u2019ve talked about previously, at that point we will determine future equity needs, if any to help support our regulated growth initiatives.","We\u2019re also laying the ground work for sustainable reliability investments in Pennsylvania. Last week, our four utilities in the state filed long-term infrastructure improvement plans with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In total these plans call for a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over the next five years to strengthen, upgrade and modernize our distribution systems.","We\u2019re anticipating that PUCs approval of the LTA [ph] proposals by mid-February. Once we have approval to the plan, we will use the distribution system improvement charge at each company to recover the appropriate fixed costs that are the part of the plans.","In New Jersey, we\u2019re further enhancing our current service reliability program with an additional 25 million spending in 2015. These expenditures which are expected to have a $0.04 per share impact on fourth quarter of 2015 earnings, will not only enhance our current service reliability program, but also demonstrate our commitment to make JCP&L a stronger company. Of course a significant part of our growth plan includes our growth plan includes our Energizing the Future transmission initiative which remains on pace to invest $970 million this year with about 80% of that amount spent year-to-date.","Recent projects include final planning and preliminary site work for a new substation near Smithfield West Virginia that will support the shale gas industry and enhance service reliability in Mon Power. We are also nearing completion on a transmission reinforcement project including a substation and 6 mile, 138 kV line in Harrison County West Virginia that will enhance service reliability for more than 14,000 Mon Power customers in Harrison, Louis and Gilmer counties. We expect the substation to be energized in December.","We are pleased to report that late yesterday afternoon FERC approved our settlement agreement for ATSI\u2019s forward-looking formula rate structure. In addition, our proposal to move our Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L transmission assets into a new affiliate called Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT is moving through the FERC and state approval processes. We continue to seek final state approval for MAIT by mid-2016. If approved we expect this structure to facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. Lastly we remain committed to holding an analyst meeting after we have results from our Ohio case.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. As always we will reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour.","Jim Pearson","Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. Before I get started I will remind you that more detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to","our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions in the Q&A or following the call.","Our strong third quarter operating earnings of $0.98 per share compares to $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis earnings were $0.94 per share for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.79 per share during the same period last year.","Our operating earnings primarily reflect higher distribution sales and the net impact of previously resolved rate cases. Higher transmission revenues that resulted from our Energizing the Future initiative and ATSI\u2019s forward-looking rate structure and higher commodity margin in our competitive business partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate.","In our distribution business residential sales increased 9% and commercial sales increased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from cooling degree days that were 36% higher than last year and 13% above normal. Adjusting for weather however, residential deliveries decreased nearly 1% and commercials sales were down 2.4% reflecting the impact of energy efficiency mandates.","As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we are examining the usage trend in all three customer classes particularly the impact of energy efficiency on residential usage and we will be prepared to discuss our load forecast in more detail during our analyst meeting. However, we do believe we are seeing the effects of energy efficient lightings sooner and with a larger impact than previous estimates.","In the industrial sector, sales decreased 3.2% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, coal mining and electrical equipment and manufacturing customers partially offset by increased usage from shale gas and automotive sectors.","In our transmission business third quarter operating earnings increased $0.04 to $0.17 per share as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI\u2019s forward-looking rate structure which began in January. In our competitive business operating earnings increased $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2014. Commodity margin increased $0.15 per share due to favorable summer weather that was warm, but not extreme coupled with lower commodity costs.","Contract sales volume decreased in line with our expectation, while wholesale sales volume increased slightly. Variable margin benefited from higher capacity revenues, lower purchase power costs and fuel expense and lower transmission charges. Operating cost increased compared to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to greater expense related to a nuclear refueling outage this quarter at Beaver Valley 2.","We remain committed to our ongoing strategy of mitigating risk by reducing sales to weather sensitive channels and have reduced the size of our residential retail book by approximately 38% since the third quarter of 2014 and also reduced the size of our weather sensitive commercial industrial book over the same period.","Looking at our sales position, for 2016 we have about 59 million megawatt hours or about 75% of our expected generation resources committed and we are currently about 45% committed for 2017 with about 36 million megawatt hours sold.","As Chuck discussed earlier, we are raising and narrowing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA range for the competitive business to 945 million to 975 million from 875 million to 950 million based on our results through the first nine months of the year and the projected savings from the cash flow improvement project. We are also reaffirming the 2016 adjusted EBITDA range that we provided in September of 950 million to 1.5 billion and as Chuck mentioned we intend to provide 2017 adjusted EBITDA after the Ohio ESP is resolved.","Moving to other financial matters, during the September investor conferences, we received questions about our pension funding plan. So we wanted to spend a moment clarifying this topic. As we do each year, we disclosed our estimated pension funding requirements for the next several years as of December 31, 2014 in the Form 10-K that was filed in February and as always we include those future funding estimates in our internal long-term planning process.","You\u2019ll recall we contributed $143 million to our pension fund earlier this year. Consistent with our normal process we will provide an update for estimated funding requirement for future years when we file our 2015 Form 10-K this coming February. I will also note that we have essentially completed our financing plans for 2015 and our expected financing plans for 2016 do not include any issuance of long term debt until the middle of next year.","As Chuck said earlier, 2015 is shaping up to be a strong and important year for FirstEnergy as we create a new frame work for our future. We have raised our operating earnings guidance based on the success of our strategies and we are making solid progress towards our goals of building long-term value for shareholders through predictable customer focused regulated growth.","Now I would like to open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Crowdell","Just a quick question I guess on Ohio PPA I am sure it will be a trend for the call, but I believe the record closes today in Columbus does the closing of the record complicate the chances of a settlement since nothing new could be introduced.","Chuck Jones","I don\u2019t think it complicates the opportunity for a settlement at all. I think we have the opportunity to settle the case all the way through any final outcome actually. So it closes the record as far as anything new being introduced into the record as far as testimony and rebuttal testimony, but it doesn\u2019t prohibit ongoing discussions.","Anthony Crowdell","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Orrill","Yeah, thank you. May be a follow up there on generally how you are feeling about the process of negotiating the PPAs and whether you feel you have better likelihood of nuclear versus coal.","Chuck Jones","Well as I\u2019ve said all along, I think that the plan that we filed is the best plan for the customers in Ohio and we continue to work to educate the commission staff as best we can on why we believe that is the case. I think, we are continuing to discuss certain parameters around the filing, but I would expect that as we go forward we are going to continue to talk about the PPA in somewhat the fashion that we filed it. Now, having said that there is always some room for negotiation, but I think the whole idea here is, we filed a plan that\u2019s good for customers, protects them over the long haul and at the end of the day as I\u2019ve told - I\u2019ve gone through the example of what happens when plants closed in the past, it creates spending and transmission that customers pay for so I think this plan kind of is neutral to what the transmission spending would be and I still think that something that we can get through across goal line with.","Greg Orrill","And maybe just a question around the pension mark-to- market and kind of your treatment there and that doesn\u2019t show up in the earnings guidance, how are you thinking about that?","Jim Pearson","Yeah, Greg this is Jim. It will not show up in our operating earnings guidance. We have historically treated that as a mark-to-market, in fact if you look at our consolidated report we have put a disclosure in there of what the range of potential impact or GAAP earnings would be if we would have marked that pension plan. Effective September 30, our plan had a loss on our return on assets of about 3.5% and discount range was 4.25%, so we put a range in there assuming that our assets return will remain at that level and the discount rate would be anywhere between 4.25% and 4.5%.","As you know October has been a very good month in the equity markets, in fact it\u2019s been probably one of the strongest months in history, so the return on our assets has improved somewhat and if we had to mark that today our discount range would be in the 4.5% range. So my expectation, all things being equal, if they don\u2019t change from today that range that we gave of $0.30 to $0.67, it would be the lower end and in fact it may be less than $0.37 and may be less than 250 million that we disclosed.","From a funding stand point, we have disclosed in the 10-K last year that it would be above 1.7 billion for the period \u201815 through \u201819. We did contribute a 143 million this year. From a funding standpoint we will have to see where the discount rate is and where the return on the assets are at the end of the year, but I don\u2019t expect anything to be materially different than what we disclosed in our 10-K in 2014.","Greg Orrill","Great, thanks","Chuck Jones","I would just follow on a little bit though Jim\u2019s answered it. I think we have been very open in disclosing what our pension funding obligations might be and the impact on our GAAP earnings, but from the very beginning of me coming into this position, one of the things we talked about was earnings quality and I think this quarter $0.94 and $0.98 GAAP versus non-GAAP. We have really reduced that gap between GAAP and non-GAAP as I told you I would and I think our earnings quality for all three quarters is substantially improved and that\u2019s the way we expect to operate going forward.","Greg Orrill","Thank you, congratulations on the quarter","Chuck Jones","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Zimbardo with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Zimbardo","Good morning, another Ohio question if you will. We have seen few data points on potential new bill in Ohio recently now just hoping you could comment on how if at all you see these developments impacting the discussion the Ohio mission that\u2019s starting, yeah.","Chuck Jones","I wouldn\u2019t expect that they should have any impact on the discussion we are having with Ohio and there\u2019s - conversely I don\u2019t think the discussions we are having with Ohio should have any impact on any decisions for new builds because the construct of our energy security plan it has no impact on the competitive markets, so I don\u2019t think the two are linked at all.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay, great and then unrelated question, I noticed the revolver borrowing fund about a billion quarter-over-quarter ,could you comment on if this represents kind of change in how you see the financial structure?","Jim Pearson","Yeah, I am not sure that revolver borrowings increased a billion dollars quarter-over-quarter, in fact if you look at our entire financing plan for the entire year we expect to increase debt just by above $350 million dollars year-over-year and most of that will be new long-term debt associated with the distribution and transmission business. In fact our revolver borrowings at the end of the 2014 were about 1.8 billion and my expectation is that they are going to be right in that range maybe slightly less than that the by the end of the year. So there is no real impact on our financing plans there.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay I just looked at the short-term borrowing declined a billion, I know you\u2019d mentioned in the past your trying to or considering terming -","Jim Pearson","I thought you said that they were up and that was what was confusing me, right. Now they would be down.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay. Sorry to clarify, is that indication that you are trying to term more out or that\u2019s just kind of normal fluctuation for the quarter.","A","That\u2019s normal fluctuation. It\u2019s not that we are terming any of that out.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Turnure with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Turnure","Good morning guys, I wanted to get a little bit more clarity on transmission CapEx going forward basically versus the current CapEx that you have laid out in your slides. If you are successful with the, I guess the innovation [ph] of the assets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania how can we think about directional potential changes there in magnitude?","Chuck Jones","Well you\u2019re going to have to wait for the analyst meeting. We\u2019ve talked about 4.2 billion of transmission spend, four year period from \u201814 through \u201817 and at this point in time I am not prepared to say where we expect that number to be \u201818 and beyond, but I think as we get through the Ohio ESP and then we see the company that we have a base to build upon after that. I think when we have our Analyst Meeting we\u2019ll talk to you more about what we expect to do in the future.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then on cost cutting, you indicated that there is a potential to increase the numbers as you\u2019ve laid them out right now, the numbers are pretty meaningful over the next several years, but they do mostly come from the unregulated side of the business. Could you talk a little bit more in detail maybe about what you\u2019re looking at that\u2019s incremental to this and any opportunities more specifically on the regulated side of the business there?","Chuck Jones","Well, first off, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be substantial and what I\u2019ve kind of challenged the team to do is we need to continue to find efficiencies in this business that will offset any inflationary forces on our cost structure, specific to the utility side of things in an environment where we\u2019re investing in reliability improvements now pretty much across our footprint. Taking cost out of the utilities doesn\u2019t make sense right now.","So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of it come out of the utilities. We\u2019re taking any incremental. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not focusing on efficient spending in the utilities, but as we create the efficiencies where recycling that back into more investment and more improved service for our customers rather than pulling it out and ultimately reducing the cost structure for the utilities.","Chris Turnure","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers","Hi, good morning, guys. First question for you just on the transmission guidance increase, CapEx has been in line basically with plan, but the earnings power from transmissions were 10% higher than you had budgeted for the year. What are you ascribing that improvement to? And how should we think about capitalizing the new base line for \u201816 and beyond?","Jim Pearson","Yeah, this is Jim. The way I would look at that, Dan, is that when we went into the year, we had some relatively conservative assumptions because of the uncertainty with the forward-looking rates within ATSI, not only the ROE but potential refunding in that. So I would say our initial estimate was somewhat conservative. And we also have a little higher rate base associated with in servicing some of the projects sooner than we had anticipated. When I would compare, say, \u201816 to \u201815, clearly we\u2019ll give you more guidance at our Analyst Meeting. But I would say the headwinds we are going to face next year is, we are going to have a lower ROE in ATSI. So that\u2019s going to impact our earnings somewhat and some of our transmission spend will be directed towards the former GPU companies where they\u2019re still on standard rates and I would not look for me like rate recovery until beginning in 2017. So I would consider probably \u201815 and \u201816 years to be somewhat flattish and then we will move on in \u201817 once we have the MAIT completed in investments going towards the GPU companies.","Dan Eggers","That was helpful. Thank you. On the demand response case, the Supreme Court\u2019s heard it now, you guys are very vested in the process. What was your read on what happened in this Supreme Court and then your expectations for when we\u2019ll get a decision and then whatever adoptions that the PJM will have to make.","Chuck Jones","So I should have preempted all of these Q&A by stating this. I said earlier, Leila is not here and I don\u2019t think you want any of us other than Leila judging what\u2019s happening at the Supreme Court. So here is what I\u2019ll do, Dan, Irene will talk with Leila and we\u2019ll get back to you on that one, but I just don\u2019t feel comfortable asking - answering technical legal questions.","Dan Eggers","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And then, Jim, looking back at the 10-K on the pension, I know this is kind of still bubbling out there. You guys had said out about $880 million for pension funding in \u201816 and \u201817 and then 646 in \u201818, \u201819, are those still realistic or is there a weighted shift some of the timing of that money being put to work?","Jim Pearson","No, those are still pretty much realistic and those are based on requirements. Dan, it\u2019s not that we can shift money. We could fund more earlier, but you look at what your funding has to be over a seven-year period and so you have to fund at least that amount. I don\u2019t expect when we update that \u201816 and \u201817 will be much different than what we disclosed in our 10-K for 2014. But we will just update some of the years based on where the return on the assets are and where the discount rate is.","The Senate had just passed the, I guess, I got the five partisan budget bill. We had extended the funding or the smoothing requirements three additional years through 2020, so that will give some type of relief, because you will be able to use your historical discount rate during those funding periods. So that will lessen all things being equal our funding requirements over that period of time.","Dan Eggers","So your assumptions in the 10-K are reflective of the extension of the smoothing or would that lower that number?","Jim Pearson","No, the 10-K that we filed in 2014 did not take into account any of the changes to the smoothing and primarily that smoothing doesn\u2019t impact our funding until year 2019.","Dan Eggers","Okay and then I guess just on the financing side of it, you guys have been keen not to talk about equity needs and that sort of thing, but should we expect more comprehensive planning update at the Analyst and would that then include whatever you would have to fund for the pension perspective?","Chuck Jones","Yeah, I think that\u2019s the whole game plan, Dan. Let\u2019s get Ohio behind us one way or another, find out where that leaves us. We know pretty much where capacity performance landed and we know we\u2019ve done internally to strengthen our cash flows. I think at that point in time we are going to give you more of a view towards the future. Two thousand and fifteen has been all about kind of strengthening the base that we want to build from.","Dan Eggers","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Chuck Jones","Good morning. Yeah.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Just as a follow-up on Ohio for a second, if you guys were to get a settlement, what would the process be in terms of after that? I mean would there be - I assume comments there would be and stuff on that and how much time before after a settlement, do you think it would take for approval of that settlement to take place?","Chuck Jones","Yes, there would be an opportunity for comment. I expect we are going to end up at the same place here regardless of a settlement which is an outcome that\u2019s finalized early next year.","Paul Patterson","Okay and by early you mean first couple of months.","Chuck Jones","I would think so, yeah.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then in terms of the pension funding, could you remind me how much the breakdown is between regulated and non-regulated with that obligation?","Chuck Jones","I would say that probably about 60% of the unfunded would reside in the regulated companies.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then you mentioned some intriguing step about the energy efficiency in lighting and the deployment of that\u2019s been a little bit more aggressive than what you previously have thought. I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what sectors you are seeing that in and what customer classes?","Chuck Jones","From my standpoint, the biggest impact has been in the residential sector. We\u2019ve seen somewhat in commercial, typically commercial customers will move towards more energy efficient products sooner than residential. But when you think about the lighting, the Federal Energy Efficiency Lighting standards kicked in 2015. You can\u2019t buy an incandescent bulb right now and we\u2019ve always expected that we would see some impact to our residential usage associated with that. It\u2019s just happening a little bit faster than we had originally planned on our original load forecast.","Paul Patterson","How much - I guess why is that do you think? And because like you said, all the stuff is sort of known. I mean what do you - can you give us a little bit more flavors to how much more that you are seeing and why you think you are seeing it?","Chuck Jones","It\u2019s hard for me to talk about customer behavior especially this early on, but my suspicion is that the cost of these bulbs are coming down and they are being offered in a number of stores and","consumers are just switching those bulbs sooner than we thought they would be. And as we said, we are looking at this pretty closely right now and we should have a better view on that when we come to the Analyst Meeting. But as we said, we automatically knew that this was going to happen. It\u2019s just maybe happening a little sooner than we expected.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And we\u2019ll find out obviously in the Analyst Meeting what it means for energy - for the energy efficiency, but I would suggest that you guys are expecting to see more sooner than previously thought. Is that --?","Chuck Jones","Yeah, we\u2019ll have that build into the load forecast we have.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you. I just had a real quick question about CES fourth quarter drivers. I think I\u2019ve done math right, recalling looking for a flattish quarter versus 4Q last year after you had a nice pickup in the third quarter here?","Chuck Jones","Yeah, I would say during the fourth quarter we would expect that the earnings would be pretty much flat quarter-over-quarter.","Paul Ridzon","We\u2019re getting a big capacity pick-up, aren\u2019t we?","Chuck Jones","Yeah, we are, but we have Beaver Valley that\u2019s out essentially in an entire month of October.","Paul Ridzon","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. I just have one left. On the LTIP that was filed in Pennsylvania a couple of weeks ago, it implies from the release that\u2019s a quarterly rate rider. Is that a done deal? I mean is that legislation or is that - you took commission [indiscernible] another utility that\u2019s done that? You are pretty confident you will get that quarterly rider?","Chuck Jones","Well, the way the process works in Pennsylvania as you file a long-term infrastructure improvement plan, which pretty much details the types of investments and the impact for customers that you expect to achieve. The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission reviews the LTIP, Once they review and approve the plan, then recovery under the distribution system, plus recovery rider is essentially, it\u2019s a legislative recovery and it\u2019s essentially very certain [ph] after that. So as long as we spend what we say we were going to spend and do what we say we\u2019re going to do.","Charles Fishman","Okay. That was the only question I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan","Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Chuck, just going back to the expectations of getting this case done by early next year, is it fair to assume that - are you able to reach a settlement it should come in the next month or so?","Chuck Jones","I\u2019m not going to handicap it, Ashar. I mean we\u2019re working every day, talking on the phone, Leila is down there meeting with the staff today, working through a lot of complex issues and it\u2019s a very complex case. So I don\u2019t want to put pressure on Leila nor on the Commission staff or any other parties that we are talking with. We just keep working through the process. And I believe that there is an opportunity for an ultimate settlement, because I think that we are getting to the point where everybody is starting to really understand why it\u2019s good for customers.","Ashar Khan","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick questions, one on CS, when we look at 2017 fact book and we look at the breakdown of the hedges and the contracted revenues that you have, it looks like there is a significant proportion that\u2019s clearly open right now, 36 terawatt hours that\u2019s committed sales and the rest is open. Do you expect more committed sales to happen in the buckets of the MM, MCI, OCI, GA [indiscernible] those structures? Do you expect more contracting or committed sales to happen in 2017 for that? Or is it generally all going to flow into the wholesale bucket?","Chuck Jones","The first item is it does not contemplate PPA scenario at all. So we are successful in getting the PPAs done. That will reduce by about half.","Donny Schneider","Yeah.","Chuck Jones","Donny, go ahead.","Donny Schneider","Yeah, yeah, Chuck is absolutely right. With the PPA, we only have about 3 terawatt hours open in the front half of \u201817 and about 16 terawatt hours in the back half and to answer your question, with the PPA we would move that into our sales channels regardless of the PPA, we would move it into the sales channels, we wouldn\u2019t take it all to the wholesale market. Without the PPA, you\u2019ve got a 41 terawatt hours again more heavily weighted on the back half of \u201817.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you and that 41 terawatt hours, if there is no PPA would be moving into the wholesale bucket?","Donny Schneider","No, no. We would move it into our LCI or [indiscernible] channels. Wholesale is kind of our last resort if you will, because we don\u2019t make much margin on that.","Unidentified Analyst","So of the 80 or so terawatt hours in total approximately 40 would be committed in the non-PPA scenario?","Donny Schneider","No, we would still hold some back for the spot market. We would hold back by about 15 to 20 terawatt hours in the spot market.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. So what is the total committed sales you would expect in the non-PPA scenario for 2017?","Donny Schneider","So it would be about 75 minus 15 or 20 so about 55 terawatt hours.","Unidentified Analyst","I got you. Okay, got it.","Chuck Jones","What Donny is describing is we are going to run that business kind of like a utility. We are going to sell forward two-thirds to three-fourths of our available generation. We are going to keep, as he said, 15 to 20 megawatt hours opened to use as what I refer to as reserve margin to ensure ourselves against weather days, cold weather days to ensure ourselves against a unit. It doesn\u2019t perform as expected and essentially be able to deliver more consistent earnings out of that sector than what we have been able to do in the past because we were exposed to volatility and we were exposed to poor performance by our generating fleet.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough. Sorry, go ahead.","Donny Schneider","As you said, if you look at our fact book on slide 98, page 49, it lays out those sales channels and our ranges around it.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, now got it exactly. I\u2019m just saying that I looked at the fact book for 2017 that 36 terawatt hours of committed sales and I was just trying to bridge to what would it look like in naturally 2017 if you had no PPA and that was helpful color that you gave me.","Donny Schneider","Sure.","Unidentified Analyst","If I would have bridged to that number that you just said, as you exit certain [indiscernible] contracts, how did that shape like the 2017 committed sales? I\u2019m just trying to understand what would be the proportions of the different buckets as you kind of think about in a non-PPA scenario, what it would look like with the committed sales?","Donny Schneider","Yeah, so I would say in a non-PPA scenario if you look at our 2016 EBITDA slide, that\u2019s going to give you the pretty good proportions and we are not intending to change those proportions.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough. Got you. Okay, thank you and then finally just a quick question on NOLs. I know that NOLs clearly help from a deferred tax perspective right now. Do you still kind of see them as a 2017-18 timeframe kind of full utilization of NOLs?","Chuck Jones","Yeah, our expectation is that, well, first bonus depreciation, we think it\u2019s likely to be extended through the \u201815 and \u201816 timeframe. That\u2019s not part of the budget bill, but it\u2019s typically done usually at the end of the year in an extender. If the bonus depreciation is not extended, then we\u2019ll likely expire our NOLs around the end of 2018 or into 2019. Assuming bonus depreciation is extended, then we could go out further into the 2020 timeframe. Again that would be impacted by the resolution of the Ohio ESP.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ryan Caylor with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Caylor","Hi, good morning.","Chuck Jones","Morning.","Ryan Caylor","Just back to the Ohio PPA real quick, just a quick question on timing AP [ph] on their Q3 2015 earnings call they gave I guess a year end 2015 expectations for a final order for their PPA. I guess it\u2019s our understanding that you guys are further long in the process right? So I mean is that difference in timing a matter of AP just being you know I guess a little more aggressive relative to your kind of early Q1 2016 timeline or any color there relative to AP would be helpful? Thanks.","Chuck Jones","Well, I would say that I think we are all just kind of trying to speculate about what could happen. We are being a little more conservative maybe then the AP in there traditionally there is not going to get a lot done in December after Thanks Giving for our RKs to get settled by the end of this calendar year they have to work pretty hard pretty much the whole month of December I think to meet the time tables so we are just expecting likely to get done after the first three year.","Ryan Caylor","Got it. That\u2019s helpful thanks.","Chuck Jones","Okay, well I don\u2019t see any more questions on our call so I want to thank you all very much for your support and just say look forward to you in a week from Monday at EEI and I am sure we will go through all these questions again. Thank you.","Jim Pearson","Thanks everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for First Energy Corporation. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties.

Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Yesterday we reported solid second quarter results, including operating earnings that were slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance, despite the impact of mild temperatures on our distribution business. These results reflect strong operational performance and financial discipline across each of our businesses and I'm proud of our entire team. In fact, their efforts have now led to eight straight quarters of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the operating earnings guidance we provided to investors.","While Jim will provide more detail, our stronger second quarter results primarily reflect the impact of new rates that went into effect early this year in eight of our utilities and higher transmission earnings related to our Energizing the Future program. Clearly, the groundwork and investments we are making in our regulated businesses over the last several years are paying off.","Now I'll spend a few minutes talking about our regulated businesses and provide an update on our efforts to exit commodity-exposed generation. Then we'll turn the call over to Jim for a more thorough review of our financial results.","Let's start with our transmission business. As we announced last quarter, in March, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both JCP&L and our Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary known as MAIT. These rates went into effect on June 1 and July 1, respectively, subject to refund pending the outcome of the hearing and settlement procedures. With MAIT in place, we are planning more than $600 million in transmission projects through 2018 that are designed to enhance service reliability for our customers in the Penelec and Met-Ed service territories.","This includes more than 330 projects to modernize or replace transmission lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid, and outfit dozens of electric substations with new equipment, digital communications and enhanced security features. In addition to the many small projects, this effort includes a $64 million upgrade to an existing 25-mile 230-kV line in our Penelec territory in north-central Pennsylvania and a $40 million rebuild of an existing 20 million (sic) 20-mile (4:31), 115-kV transmission line in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. As you'll recall, the majority of our initial investment in Energizing the Future was focused in ATSI, which covers our Ohio and part of our western Pennsylvania service territories. Now we are pleased to expand these grid modernization and reliability investments to the east.","Turning to our distribution business. As I mentioned, quarter-over-quarter results improved due to new rates that went into effect in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in January. These helped to offset the impact of a very temperate spring, which included the mildest April temperatures we have ever recorded. In the industrial class, we experienced our fourth consecutive quarter of load growth, driven largely by the shale gas, steel, coal mining and chemical industries.","The mild weather we have experienced across our system during the first half of the year had an $0.08 per share unfavorable impact versus the normal weather that is assumed in our operating earnings guidance. However, based on the trends we are seeing, we believe the full year load growth is likely to be slightly better than our initial forecast. If this plays out, we expect the load improvements in the second half of 2017 to offset the impact of mild temperatures in the first half of the year.","We are optimistic about the trends we are seeing in our distribution business and pleased with the continued progress of our Energizing the Future initiative. Together, we believe these regulated growth strategies are positioning our company for sustained customer service-oriented growth. I don't want to skip over the results for our competitive business. Again, Jim will provide more detail, but I want to congratulate the teams at Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 2, which both had extremely successful refueling outages. Both units had 29-day outages and for Perry, it was the shortest in the plant's history.","We are pleased to see the strong operational performance from these important assets. Staying with the competitive business, I will also note that FES achieved an uptick in direct retail sales this quarter, resulting from the acquisition of several new large commercial and industrial customers in Ohio. The addition of these new customers is in line with FES' retail sales plan, which focuses on conservatively hedging its expected generation, while managing potential cash collateral needs. Despite conservative operations, this remains a volatile business and we continue working to exit commodity-exposed generation.","So, let's switch gears and review our efforts towards that objective. We've made a lot of progress since we announced our strategic review of this business back in November. From the beginning, we have been focused on seeking solutions that are in the best interest of all constituents, including shareholders, creditors, employees, customers, and the communities where these plants are located.","First, we continue to make progress on our negotiations for the sale of gas and hydro assets owned by Allegheny Energy Supply. As you'll recall, we entered into an agreement for the sale in January. In June, FERC granted approval of the transaction. However, the terms of the agreement have continued to evolve. The parties are exploring alternative structures in terms of pricing and closing. Based on current discussions and reflecting the impact of prevailing market conditions, CES recorded a $0.19 per share non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter. We are targeting to close the transaction with revised terms in the second half of the year.","In West Virginia, our Mon Power utility is working through the regulatory process to complete the purchase of Allegheny Energy Supply's 1,300-megawatt Pleasants plant. We responded to our recent FERC request for additional information, and we expect final approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC by early 2018. When these two transactions are complete and we pay off all remaining long-term debt at Allegheny Energy Supply, including make-whole payments, we expect to realize approximately $350 million in net proceeds.","Let's turn now to a review of FES, where we also continue to make progress on other significant outstanding issues. In April, we discussed the settlement with CSX and BNSF on a coal transportation dispute. We remain engaged in settlement efforts with BNSF and Norfolk Southern on a second coal transportation dispute. The arbitration panel has declined the railroad's request to resolve certain issues before discovery and has set a trial date for June of 2018. We remain optimistic that a settlement can be reached.","In addition, FirstEnergy and FES each have a fully engaged team of financial and legal advisers to ensure that both entities are well prepared, as FirstEnergy exits the commodity-exposed generation business. And in a recent development, we are scheduled to have discussions with FES creditors next week.","Finally, we are closely monitoring the status of initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Over the last few months, more than 6,500 Ohio community leaders, citizens and businesses have voiced their support of the Zero-Emission Nuclear resource program, or ZEN. As we discussed during our last call, legislation was introduced in the Ohio House and Senate in April, which would help keep nuclear assets as a part of Ohio's generation mix.","Similar to programs in New York and Illinois, the bills call for recognizing the critical energy security and environmental attributes of nuclear power in Ohio. In addition to engaging our communities, we recently held a virtual town hall to educate more than 100 legislators and key stakeholders on the potential benefits of this program, which would support Ohio jobs, economic growth and reliable and affordable generation, and environmental progress for many years to come. We will continue these efforts once legislators return from summer recess.","At the federal level, we are looking forward to the release of the Department of Energy's study that was initiated by the Trump administration and U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in April. The study is expected to address economic and security risks associated with the premature closure of the nation's fuel-secure base load generation as a result of regulations, subsidies and tax policies, as well as how well markets are addressing the inherent benefits of existing fuel-secure base load assets. We're optimistic that the final DOE study will be released soon and could offer solutions to address this national concern. And the FES board is closely following this effort, which is expected to help them determine the right path forward for FES.","For now, FES continues to have access to the unregulated money pool. As of June 30, FES, its subsidiaries, and FENOC had net borrowings of $174 million from the money pool, primarily reflecting the satisfaction of the June 1 bond maturity, lease and interest payments, as well as the initial installment on the coal transportation settlement. Our current expectation is that they will have no borrowings by March 2018, even after funding capital expenditures and nuclear fuel.","Last night, we updated full year 2017 GAAP earnings estimate to $1.95 to $2.25 per share, primarily to reflect the additional asset impairment charges related to the pending sale of the gas and hydro units. We also reaffirmed our operating earnings guidance of $2.70 to $3 per share, and provided third and fourth quarter guidance ranges. Again, I am pleased with our progress on both our regulated growth initiatives and the significant progress we have made over a very short period to exit commodity-exposed generation in a timely, yet thoughtful manner.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As Chuck said, we reported solid second quarter results that were slightly better than the midpoint of our operating earnings guidance, with another very strong quarter with respect to operational performance across the company.","Our GAAP results of $0.39 per share include an impairment charge of $0.19 per share related to the current discussions with the buyer for the Allegheny Energy Supply asset sale, which Chuck discussed earlier. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share in the quarter. As I walk through each segment, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report to the financial community, which is posted on our website.","In our distribution business, new Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania rates that went into effect in January raised second quarter earnings by $0.20 per share. Weather was extremely mild across our service area with heating degree days 30% lower than the same period of 2016 and 24% below normal. This drove a 0.7% decrease in total distribution deliveries, with sales to residential customers decreasing 4.6% and commercial deliveries down 1.5%.","We have now marked four consecutive quarters of growth in the industrial sector, and on a weather-adjusted basis, total distribution deliveries across all segments increased 1% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. We are hopeful that these positive trends will continue as the economy improves in our footprint.","In our transmission business, second quarter earnings benefited from higher revenues resulting from our continued investment in the Energizing the Future program. At corporate, our second quarter results also reflect higher interest cost and impact of the effective income tax rate.","Turning to the competitive business, commodity margin continues to reflect the lower capacity revenues related to the weaker prices that went into effect last June, as well as the expected decrease in retail sales, which were down 2.2 million megawatt hours. This was partially offset by lower depreciation expense related to the asset impairments recorded last year. Consistent with our expectations, the total retail customer count is now about 850,000, which is down from 1.5 million a year ago.","We are reaffirming 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $475 million for the competitive business and currently expect to come in at the high end of that range. We have also increased the 2018 adjusted EBITDA range to $140 million to $260 million, from $130 million to $250 million, reflecting additional committed contract sales.","Before I move to questions, I want to add a note about how pleased we were with our $3 billion debt offering in June. This transaction eliminated a new near-term debt maturity by refinancing FirstEnergy Corp.'s $650 million bond expiring March of 2018 with the remainder reducing FirstEnergy Corp.'s revolver borrowings, resulting in stronger corporate liquidity and reducing our exposure to rising interest rates. This was the largest non-M&A debt deal in the history of the utility industry. Frankly, we were overwhelmed by investor interest. At one point, we understand the order book was over $15 billion.","We thank you for your interest and your support. Again, we are pleased with the performance across our company and the strong results of the first half of the year. We are fully focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our regulated growth strategy.","Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Chuck. So, the interesting new wrinkle here is your first meeting with creditors at FES, which I think you said today, you have had no discussions. So, maybe you could give a little more color on why that meeting is happening now and who instigated it, and just why now, why not before, why not later?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I can't provide a lot of color, but I think I can say this, Steve, that I think we always knew that somewhere along the line, this engagement with creditors was going to happen. I think the color about why now is, I think it, number one, I think took the creditors to get organized around what they might want to approach with, and our FES team got a call from a group that, at least, preliminarily says they represent more than 80% of the creditors, and they outlined a formula for a potential discussion that was interesting enough that FES decided it was worth pursuing.","I will be engaged in that discussion because, obviously, the creditors are interested in talking about what FirstEnergy might be willing to do to get this settled also. So, beyond that, I think we always knew this was going to happen at some point in time. I think it is clearly the preferred route if we end up in a bankruptcy proceeding with FES to do it through a structured settlement that all parties are comfortable with. So, we need to \u2013 we just need to start those discussions and see them through to the end and see what comes out of them. And beyond that, I think it's pretty clear, we're not going to negotiate with creditors in the public venue, so the types of things we're talking about, they're going to morph and we'll just have to communicate it at the end when we know the results.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the DOE, do you have any update on timing of when you expect that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I was just down in Washington the last two days and I heard a joke and the joke that I heard was, when you \u2013 what do you call a federal study that's supposed to take 60 days that takes 120 days? And the answer is, early. So, I think I can tell you this, the people inside the Department of Energy are taking this mission very seriously. They got reams of data submitted to them, reams of studies submitted to them.","They are working through all that. I am confident that they are doing it as diligently as possible. I think the Secretary's assignment to do this within 60 days was very ambitious given the complexity of these issues. But having said that, I think they're probably getting close to wrapping it up, and I would expect \u2013 I expect something probably in the next couple weeks to come out of there.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one last question, the utility net of parent guidance that you have given for the company, I know it goes back, I think, to EEI for the next several \u2013 for several years. Obviously, not refreshing the whole thing, but just overall, is that still kind of the ballpark view for the utility net of parent, excluding it?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. I don't think that's changed at all, Steve, from what we gave you there.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just to follow up on Steve's question with respect to the discussions with creditors, is this a process that you would \u2013 I guess, I'm thinking about that in relationship to a potential Chapter 11 filing. Is that a dialogue you'd like to sort of play out before you would consider a formal Chapter 11 filing, or is it \u2013 how would the two sort of interplay with each other?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, as I said earlier, I think we always knew that there would come a point in time where we would be having these discussions with creditors. I think it would be in everybody's best interest if we can come up with a mutually agreeable way to deal with the issues that exist at FES. It's far too early to speculate as to whether we're going to be able to do that or not. But I can tell you this, the discussion they had with FES was intriguing enough that we're willing to sit down and talk about it and we just have to let it play out.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Totally understood, okay. And then just on the DOE study, I think a lot of people feel that the most likely outcome there is for DOE to direct or request that FERC look at potential approaches to reforming the market to provide an arguable improvement in payments to base load generation. Is that a \u2013 how valuable, I guess, from your perspective do you see that in terms of your assessment of whether or not FES is insolvent? In other words, that would really kick off probably a very long process with a very uncertain outcome. Is that sufficient to sort of sway your take as to whether FES is insolvent, given that DOE itself doesn't really likely have a direct authority to make these payments? How do you feel about sort of the involvement of FERC in the process?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, let me clear up a couple of things. May have left an impression on the last call that we're waiting on this in some fashion. We are moving forward with everything that needs to be done to exit the commodity-exposed generation business in a prudent, thoughtful manner. And now, the next step in that process is engaging with the FES creditors to see if there's a way to expedite that process and obviously if we can, that will probably be the most expeditious way to get out of that business.","I continue to think, though, it's prudent for us to see what the DOE says and where they might go, and how serious of a problem they think this is. I mean \u2013 and it could range from them saying the markets are fine and everything's working great to \u2013 we have a very serious national security, fuel diversity, fuel security issue and we need to do something immediately.","I don't know where it's going to come out and I'm not going to speculate about how the FES board will react depending on what that is. So, that's the other point I want to make. The decision to move forward with FES, one of the things we needed to do was create that separation. We have an independent board and an independent group of officers that are now making the decisions for FES. I am not making those decisions anymore.","And they will evaluate what comes out of the DOE study, in the context of where they're at with this entire process to exit and they will be the ones that decide. But it can be such a wide range, we're within a couple weeks. When we know what we know, then I think that's when we're in a position to comment about what they said and what they think the future might look like.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Thank you. Just to sort of follow up on the DOE, just \u2013 we've already seen some efforts on the part of FERC to sort of help out base load generation. Clearly, there has been identification of it. They've had a technical conference. I'm just wondering, what specifically do you envision, I guess, the DOE study doing practically to sort of change the trajectory at FERC or to speed it up or what have you? Do you follow what I'm saying?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, maybe the best way to answer that is, I've spent a lot of time down in D.C. talking to everybody that will listen to me, so why don't I just tell you what I've been telling everybody. I've been telling everybody, I think our country is heading for a disaster, okay? The disaster could take a number of different forms. One disaster could be a national security type of issue.","We are taking the most sophisticated bulk electric system that exists anywhere in this world and putting it on top of a bulk gas system that is very unsophisticated and that sets up security risks if there were ever an attack on that bulk gas system, it does not have the redundancy that the bulk electric system has. Since the blackout in 2003 under NERC's guidance, we have built extreme redundancy into how we operate that bulk electric system. None of that matters if the gas quits flowing, and we are reducing the amount of fuel-secure base load generation we have to keep the lights on in the event of that type of an event.","Second, I think we could be heading for an economic disaster. We are getting to where we are relying too much on one fuel source for the generation of electricity, and I think fuel diversity is critical to keeping economic stability. With where gas is priced now, if anything happens to cause that gas price to go up again and create a volatility in the gas markets, the volatility in electric markets is going to be so great that I don't think industry in our country is going to be able to tolerate it. So, there's an economic crisis that we're facing.","And when these assets close, they close forever. They do not get reopened. So, that is why the State of New York stepped in and said, we need to do something to take care of our assets. That's why the State of Illinois stepped in and said, we need to do something. Ohio is looking at it, Connecticut is looking at it, New Jersey is looking at it, and I tell them, the federal government created this problem. It's up to the federal government to fix this problem.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Do you see the federal government taking action in the near-enough term to change the trajectory of FES and the potential for filing Chapter 11?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I just said earlier, I'm not going to speculate on what they're going to say and what they're going to do. I think we're going to know that in the next few weeks and then I'll answer all the questions that I need to answer once I know what we're dealing with.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I mean there's so many different things that could happen and this is kind of the position that I've taken my entire time in this job. I get a lots of speculatory questions and I always say, listen, I'll answer questions once I know the facts.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Fair enough. And then just finally on the $131 million impairment, how should we think about those negotiations and what the ultimate impact financially might be with respect to this most \u2013 or this announced reduction \u2013 this write-off?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. This is Jim. The way I would look at it is, there're ongoing negotiations we're having and I think the adjustment to the purchase price really just reflects the market conditions we're experiencing right now. So, that's the only way I'd look at that, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Do you see that changing at all, or I mean could that \u2013 in other words, if prices rebound that would change, or I mean how should we \u2013 let me ask you this, when do you think negotiations will be completed?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","We think that it will probably be done by third quarter, early fourth quarter, maybe, by the end of this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. I'm not sure when it will close, but the discussions should be done by then.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi guys. And I wanted to, unfortunately, spend a little bit more time just on FES, just to understand, from a risk perspective, if ultimately you're looking at it from an FE shareholder perspective, when do you think you'd be able to box the risk around FES in terms of the negotiation with creditors? Firstly, if you could give any ranges around what you think \u2013 what's at stake effectively, and then when do you think you'll have clarity in terms of providing certainty on how this process is going to play out?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, Praful, I said earlier, we're not going to negotiate with FES creditors in public. We have boxed already the risk that we think FES shareholders have to a bankruptcy \u2013 or FirstEnergy shareholders have to a bankruptcy of FES, and that hasn't changed since the last quarter. That's obviously going to be a key ingredient in any negotiations with creditors. So, beyond that, it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate with creditors publicly and \u2013 but we're going to approach those negotiations clearly with an eye towards the impact on FirstEnergy shareholders, both in the short and long term as we move to exit this business.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. And then just so I understand from a timing perspective on the ZEN, if this is all connected, right, in terms of the ZEN and how that fits into FES and the negotiation, if the ZEN takes time to play out, even though it's coming, it may come next year, let's say. How does that then play in terms of your negotiation, and does that extend the timing of how you think this \u2013 the actual process (33:10) plays out?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No, there is no connection in my mind. And if we sit down with creditors next week and strike an agreement in one meeting and file that agreement with a bankruptcy court, I am going to continue to fight for this ZEN legislation because it is the right thing to do for the State of Ohio, it's the right thing to do for those assets. It gives those assets the best chance of running under new owners.","I'm not sure those assets will run unless there is something done either federally or by the State of Ohio to ensure that they get a different financial return model, and that's bad. So, we're going to continue to work on ZEN whether or not \u2013 irrespective of what happens with FES. Don't even connect the two.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So, if you strike a deal and then you get the ZEN later on, is there going to be like a value carve-out or some form of value that flows back to FE shareholders because otherwise that's significant value at that point from the ZEN, which shouldn't all go to the creditors, I'm assuming?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would think it's unlikely that it's going to deliver enough value to overcome the amount that's going to be owed to creditors in a bankruptcy. So, don't expect any of that to flow to FirstEnergy shareholders.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. All right. Thank you so much.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","But it's going to make these assets saleable by those creditors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Gregg.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Two questions. First, what are you thinking about in terms of the prospects for ZENs in Pennsylvania? And then around the load growth, is there any \u2013 could you talk a little bit about \u2013 a little more about the strength that you're seeing there and what gives you confidence that that's going to kind of carry through the year?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, the prospects for ZEN in Pennsylvania, I don't even feel capable of commenting on yet. The dialogue is early. I think they've got other legislative issues they're wrestling with there, but I view it the same way. We will continue to support that discussion irrespective of where we're at with the exit of FES, and even after the exit of FES, because I think it's the right thing to do.","I think the market policies are not working and it \u2013 how can you rationalize in a country like the United States of America that in one part of this country, we're spending billions and billions of dollars to build new nuclear plants, and then in another part of this country we're closing nuclear plants that are already built and have 20 years of useful life. These policies have failed and they need to be fixed and if they aren't going to get fixed by the federal government, then I think the states will continue to step in and fix them.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on the load growth?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Gregg. What we saw for the first half of this year was that \u2013 or the second quarter year-to-date is that on a weather-adjusted basis, our residential was up about 1%, and our commercial was just up slightly. Our rates and economic team, they've taken a look at that with customer growth and their view on the economy and they think the trend will continue in the second half with residential and commercial continuing the trend upward.","From an industrial side, we've had the increase associated with petroleum and shale gas. We are seeing some negative results in the automotive sector, but at this point, I think, we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to see some continued trend upward on residential and commercial. And industrial, we think, will stay fairly strong with the exception of the auto industry.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to understand \u2013 just make sure I'm understanding the sort of government's aspects of what you're saying about engaging creditors and the two entities correctly. It sounded like there's already been discussion among creditors with FES, but now what you're saying is that FE, as in you, are going to sit down with them next week? Am I getting that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. There have been one discussion between the group representing the creditors and FES. And in that discussion, FES reached out to me to ask if we would be willing to sit down and engage in that process, and I clearly said, yes, we would be willing to sit down and engage in that process. And that first meeting's happening very soon. So, that's as much as I can tell you at this point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, on \u2013 you made this comment that you've boxed the liabilities, and I'd sort of a two-part question on that. Are there other rail-type contracts beyond the two you've talked about? And would it \u2013 would you guys mind just sort of reminding us what these \u2013 what the boxed liabilities are that you've talked about in public just so we kind of got straight on the \u2013 what you've put out there on that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Jim will cover all of what we've given you in the past about the potential exposure to FirstEnergy shareholders directly related to the bankruptcy. On the rail settlement, we disclosed a number in the first quarter of what we thought we would be in the range of to settle both of those contracts.","As I said in my remarks, the railroads asked for an expedited process on the second contract that they did not get. So, that's now scheduled for trial next June. I haven't changed and we haven't changed our view on ultimately what we might settle for and we're working to try to still do that. So, those numbers haven't changed.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Those are the \u2013 there are two of these contracts and that's it? Or are there others that we just haven't kind of bubbled up to the surface?","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, there's two minor companion cases, if you would, in federal courts dealing with BN. But at this point, we're very comfortable, they're kind of the same ones. The first one was wrapped up with the first settlement, the second \u2013 if we wrap up the second piece of the settlement, it'll go along with it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Don't see any other exposure, Jonathan, than what we've communicated.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if Jim wouldn't mind, just kind of reminding us the list that would be \u2013 that would help us.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Sure, yeah. We have a slide in the appendix of the quarterly highlights, but let me highlight it. We have some unfunded pension, OPEB and some other employee benefits, that's about $855 million. Rail settlements out there is about $72 million. We have these secured surety bonds as well as the secured credit facility, that's about $700 million in total and then we have some other energy contracts and guarantees, they're about $60-some-million. So, that's about $1.7 billion out there, of which $700 million is secured by first mortgage bonds.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciate that.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","No problem, John, yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. A couple of questions. One just on the dry cask storage, I have to be honest, I'm not the world's greatest expert on this, how does that \u2013 if a nuclear unit retires early and if you immediately begin the decommissioning or SAFSTOR process, what is it you're exactly required to do that would take about $1 billion of spend to comply, $1 billion though spread over a long, long period of time, it seems like. Like, what's physically actually happening and then what's the process to get reimbursement from DOE? And have we ever seen anybody actually do that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I'm not much more schooled on it than you, Michael, so \u2013 but simply, if these plants are shut down, there is a process where you're going to remove the fuel from the reactor, you are going to put it into the pool inside the plant. It's going to be there for a while until it decays to the point where it can be safely put in dry cask storage.","The process for doing that is a process where FENOC is responsible for as the licensee for those sites for the safe shutdown of those facilities. FENOC would fund that and apply to the Department of Energy for reimbursement and that's about as much as I know. We can get you more details offline if you need them.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Michael, this is Jim. We do have a slide in our appendix that covers some of our nuclear facts, it gives you like some of the NDT funding, but we also have like a dry cask storage overview. So, I think if you go through that, and then if you have any further questions, we would be more than happy to jump on the line with you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I can follow up offline. My biggest question was really the reimbursement by the DOE. Is there any precedent for that? I can do that offline. I actually want to ask a follow-on question, totally unrelated on the regulated side of the business. And it's really \u2013 when you look \u2013 Chuck, when you look at the cost structure, and I'm thinking non-fuel O&M, how do your utilities compare relative to the companies you would view as your peers?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but when we benchmark our T&D O&M expenses, they benchmark very low across the industry, if that's what you're asking.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That is exactly what I'm asking. Okay. And how about kind of corporate-level costs or A&G-level costs?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Again, I think we benchmark very well. I mean, Michael, we went through six years of cost reduction initiatives across this company and that was in every part of this business. We have worked extremely hard to get as efficient at everything that we do, whether that was in the utility or the generation business, when we launched CFIP, that was several hundred million dollars more of costs that we figured out how to get out of this company.","So, from a cost structure, we benchmark very well pretty much across the board now. We have individual pockets where a given corporate area, we've got room to improve and we've identified those and we're working on them. But in general, we're top quartile or top decile, pretty much across the board in all that benchmarking.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, Chuck. Just quickly, do you think an outcome from the DOE, whether it's supportive or not supportive, would help the likelihood of getting a ZEN passed in Ohio?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think there's the potential that depending on what DOE says, it could wake up some of the legislators who aren't necessarily seeing the future concerns. So, I would say, yeah, I mean, it's possible, but we're actively working the ZEN legislation in Ohio and that's our job to go out and one by one convince these legislators that this is good for the state and they should vote for it. And that's what we're doing. If something comes out of the DOE study that we can take to those meetings and use, we're definitely going to use it.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. At what point do you envision putting FES into disc ops? What do you have to cross to do that?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","It would probably be, at the time, if there was a restructuring and we had to deconsolidate FES, it would be at that point in time, it wouldn't be before then.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, just on the core business for FE, the regulated utility. So, you talked about the cost structure, how about the investment structure and your asset \u2013 in your regulated assets and the ways to fund it. We're hearing from Ohio that the strain of your balance sheet has prevented you from investing in some of your distribution assets. We're still waiting for equity to be issued. So, can we talk about how you envision the growth in your core business, largely regardless of what happens with FES?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, yeah, Angie, so what we've talked about is a growth of our T&D business in the range of 4% to 6%. Some of that is going to be choppy because you have to have rate cases to recover those investments. But much of it is through transmission formula rates now, much of it is through a range of different distribution recovery mechanisms, in particular, in Ohio and Pennsylvania.","So, we're still looking in that range of 4% to 6% annual growth. That doesn't mean it's going to be that every single year. It means one year might be 8% and the next year might be 2%, and so forth because of just the way some of these things happen. But that hasn't changed. The ability to finance it, I think we've communicated, we're going to be issuing some equity over the next few years and I've answered that question repeatedly since moving into this position now almost three years ago.","We got lots of questions about why not issue equity quickly, and my answer was, I think equity is intended for growing the company, not to work your way out of a difficult position financially. I think we worked our way out of that difficult position in the right way by cutting more costs, by getting more efficient in everything that we do and got to a position to where now we have the ability to invest going forward and I have no embarrassment about saying, we're going to use equity for part of that growth. That's what it's intended for.","When we look at transmission, in particular, because we're now four years and $4.2 billion into that, it's getting to a point where it funds a lot of that itself. So, I think we're poised to move forward, we're sticking to the 4% to 6% growth rate for now. When we're done with this exit of commodity-exposed generation, then we'll talk about it at that point in time to see where we're at.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm just asking because you said that you guys didn't benchmark yourself against lot of T&D operations on the cost perspective, but if you just look at your rate base per customer, I know it's a simplistic measure, it does seem like your distribution businesses are under-invested versus those of your peers in the same states, which, I mean, could be a function of the level of funding that you have available. So, I'm not trying to say to issue more equity to shore up the balance sheet, but maybe accelerate that distribution growth.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Angie, it's very complicated, but I look at it this way. We're going to spend money on the right things to serve our customers the right way and create the right growth for our shareholders, and that's a complex balance. Across our service territory, in particular, we've had negative or flat load growth now for the last eight years. And when you have that type of an environment, you have to be cautious about how you look at distribution investments because you've got no load growth to pay for it, which means then it's rate increases and it's rate increases across the customer base that we serve that quite frankly, every dollar that they pay in their electric bill is a challenge for many of them.","So, we try to balance it all. There is nothing stopping us from doing more, but I also would say this, our reliability to our distribution customers in every state that we serve is near the top. So, we've invested the right way to serve the customers the right way. And as time moves on, what you're outlining is that means we have plenty of opportunity to do that going forward.","On the O&M side, we focus real heavily on O&M because in the customers' bill, they pay that back to us dollar for dollar. So, the fact that we've reduced our O&M over time, and we don't \u2013 and you don't earn anything on it as shareholders, we just get that back. So, we've put ourselves in a position where we're making the right kind of investments, we've been very strategic about it in the right way where we can then move forward state by state and grow not just the utility earnings, but grow the level of service that we're providing to the customers at the same time.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Chris Melandia (53:29) of Wellington Management.

And welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp, Fourth Quarter 2019 Earning Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you Ms. Prezelj, you may now begin.","Irene Prezelj","Thanks Doug. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. ","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today\u2019s discussion.","Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the Q&A session.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Jones","Thank you, Irene, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2019 was another great year and a step forward for FirstEnergy, marked by solid execution on initiatives that benefit our customers, shareholders, communities and our company. ","One of the accomplishments that makes us most proud is our record of delivering on the commitments we made to the financial community. This morning we announce 2019 GAAP earnings of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.58 per share, which is at the top-end of the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call. ","By executing on our customer focus growth strategy, along with some benefits from third quarter weather, we successfully mitigated the absence of the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider in the second half of the year. ","We reached five years of consistently meeting or exceeding the mid-point of the quarterly guidance that we provided. The culture of execution and ownership that our leadership team has established at FirstEnergy is one you can continue to count on as we improve service for our customers and communities and deliver strong results for our shareholders. ","Two years ago we introduced our first long term growth rate projection of 6% to 8% compounded annually from 2018 to 2021. In the first year we hit it out of the park. Our 2019 growth versus our original 2018 guidance was 12%, excluding both the Ohio DMR and weather impacts. ","Our culture of strong execution is clearly evident and has gotten us off to a great start, on what now is a five year growth plan, and we're looking forward to another solid year in 2020 as we reaffirm our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. ","I continue providing investors with clarity into our long term expectations for earnings growth. In November we extended the CAGR at a rate of 5% to 7% through 2023. As we\u2019ve discussed, this projection includes plans to issue a modest amount of equity, up to a total of $600 million annually starting in 2022. When this happens, it will represent the first infusion of equity into our growth initiatives since early 2018, and we will have invested approximately $12 billion in our business during that period.","By successfully executing on our regulated growth strategies, we have driven strong results for investors. In 2019 our total shareholder return was 34%, placing our stock within the top quartile of the EEI Index. The TSR over the last two years, 2018 and 2019 was 71%, making FirstEnergy the number one stock in EEI Index over that period. ","Over the past several years the rating agencies have acknowledged our transition to a fully regulated company with primarily Transmission and Distribution operations resulting in a lower risk profile. In 2019 we received numerous ratings upgrades across the FirstEnergy family, as well as at the parent level. ","With the November upgrade from Fitch, we are making solid progress towards our goal to achieve solid BBB ratings at all three agencies. While we remain focused on making steady improvements to our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to support our plans for growth, including the extended CAGR and associated equity issuance. ","In 2019 we continued executing on our long term, customer focus growth plans. This included an annual capital investment of approximately $3 billion in our transmission and distribution infrastructure, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. ","In our Transmission business we successfully completed year six of our Energizing the Future investment program, with more than $6.8 billion in investments during that period. As we reported to you throughout 2019, our customers in the ATSI footprint are seeing measurable reliability improvements, including a nearly 50% reduction in equipment related transmission outages, as there is all the work we're doing to modernize the Grid. As we continue extending the program into our eastern footprint, we expect those customers to experience similar benefits. ","We took another important step in 2019, the continued expansion of our Energizing the Future Initiative. In December FERC accepted our application to move JCP&L\u2019s Transmission assets in to forward-looking formula rates effective January 1, 2020 subject to refund. With this change, nearly 90% of our transmission business is on forward looking formula rights. ","The forward looking rate structure in New Jersey supports our plan for approximately $175 million and customer focused capital spending on the JCP&L transmission system this year. On the distribution side of our business, last month we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to implement a decoupling mechanism for our residential and commercial customers in the state. ","The commission also removed the requirement that our Ohio companies filed a distribution-rate case by 2024. Decoupling provides rate transparency and stability for these customers, while providing revenue certainty to our Ohio companies. Rates for 2019 and each year thereafter will be reconciled to 2018 baseline revenues and adjusted through a conservation support rider. There is no impact from the rider on 2019 earnings. That adjustment will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward the rider will be reflected in current period results. ","Also in Ohio, our utilities are moving forward with the $516 million three year Grid Modernization program that was approved by the PUCO in July. As we\u2019ve discussed, the plan includes modernization projects designed to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. ","We expect to complete approximately $170 million of Grid Mod work this year. This initial phase includes deploying 250,000 smart meters to Ohio customers, implementing time varying rates and installing more than 600 reclosers and capacitors on the Electric Distribution System, which will help automatically isolate problems, prevent entire circuit lockouts and quickly restore electric service to customers. ","In Pennsylvania, we completed work on the initial phase of our original $350 million long term infrastructure improvement plan in 2019. Last month the Public Utility Commission approved our LTIP 2, spanning 2020 through 2024. The LTIP 2 program includes a $572 million investment across our four Pennsylvania utilities to accelerate distribution infrastructure projects in the state. ","The improvement plan for each utility complements the work we already perform on our distribution network to reduce the number and duration of outages experienced by our 2 million Pennsylvania customers. Investments include replacing older polls, lines and fuses, installing new substation equipment, network boats and manual covers and reconfiguring circuits. ","Approximately $120 million of the work is expected to be completed in 2020, across our Pennsylvania service area, with the remainder spent over the next four years. The cost associated with the service reliability investments are expected to be recovered through the Pennsylvania distribution system improvement charge. ","You recall that earlier in 2019 the Maryland Public Service Commission approved our rate case and Electric Distribution Investment surcharge and a five year electric vehicle pilot program, while The New Jersey Board of Utilities approved are JCP&L Reliability Plus Initiative. Together, these initiatives position us to improve service to our customers as we enable new technologies and the Grid of the future. ","Later this month, we plan to file a distribution rate \u2013 base-rate case in New Jersey. We will seek to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our customers, along with recovery of Storm costs incurred over the last few years. ","To sum up my discussion of our Regulated Investments, I want to remind you that after the conversion to JCP&L Transmission assets to a forward-looking formula rate, more than 60% of our annual investment will now be in formula rates and distribution riders, making our investment profile very transparent. ","Finally, I hope you've taken the time to review our five year strategic plan and our corporate responsibility report, which were both published to our website in the fall. These reports are an important element of our commitment to provide transparency and enhanced engagement with our stakeholders. They also offer a platform to track progress on our goals and strategies, including ESG initiatives such as our carbon reduction target, average stability, a more diverse and inclusive work force, and our ISS Governance Score. ","We're excited to recently earn the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index designation for the second consecutive year and last month we were named the Forbes list of the best employers for diversity. In addition, we are one of only four companies in our sector to achieve the best possible rating in the ISS Governance Quality score. We will refresh the data in our corporate responsibility report when we publish our annual report next month and we intend to update the strategic plan later this year to maintain a five year outlook. ","I think you will see that we are continuing to drive FirstEnergy toward our mission of become a premier forward thinking electric utility that our stakeholders can trust and believe in. As I mentioned earlier, we are affirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We are also pleased to affirm our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023. In addition, we are introducing operating earnings guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2020. ","Thank you for your time. We had a great year and we look forward to building on our progress. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for a review of the fourth quarter and 2019. ","Steve Strah","Good morning; it's great to speak with you today. All reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available in the strategic and financial highlights document that is posted to our website. We also posted and updated fact book to the website this morning, which includes additional supporting materials related to 2022 and 2023, such as our capital in load forecasts. ","Now let's review our results. We reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $0.20 per share, driven by our annual non-cash pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our pension performance later in my comments. ","Adjusting for special items, fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.55 per share, which is above the mid-point of the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. ","In the distribution business, earnings were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. O&M expenses were lower this quarter compared to the same period in 2018 and distribution revenues were higher. This offset the absence of the Ohio DMR and the impact of more mild temperatures across our footprint. ","Total distribution earnings increased due to incremental writer revenue in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but customer usage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 on both an actual and weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 2% below normal and 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 1.3% on an actual basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, but increased slightly on a weather adjusted basis. ","In the commercial customer class, fourth quarter sales decreased 4.3% on an actual basis and 3.5%, when adjusted for whether compared to the same period in 2018. ","Finally in our industrial class, fourth quarter loads decreased 2.4%. While the shale gas sector continues to grow, we saw our sales decline in every other major sector, including steel, automotive, coal and chemical. ","Looking at our load trends for the full year of 2019, we are encouraged to see the stability in the residential sector where we've recorded two consecutive years of modest growth in weather adjusted sales. However, full year 2019 sales to commercial customers were down 2% compared to 2018. Drivers include weaker economic conditions, energy efficiency and distributed generation measures initiated by customers in the education and food and beverage sectors, and lower usage from the real-estate sector related to decreases in new construction. ","While it\u2019s widely recognized that the U.S. has entered into a manufacturing recession, the impacts of that slump, combined with a couple large plant closings resulted in a 1.7% decrease in deliveries to industrial customers for the year. ","Turning back to fourth quarter results for the Transmission business, earnings increased primarily due to higher rate babe at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the energizing the future program. And in our Corporate segment, fourth quarter results primarily reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 contribution to the First Energy Foundation. ","Before we open the call to your questions, let's spend a moment on a few other financial matters, starting with the pension performance and its impact on our future funding requirements. In 2019 our pension plan investments produced a return on assets of 20.3%, far exceeding our original assumption of 5.7%. This superior plan performance, coupled with the low discount rate of 3.34% produced two outcomes. ","First, our 2019 non cash after tax pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment is approximately $480 million, which is at the lower end of the range we provided in October. ","Second, our pension plan funding requirements for 2022 and 2023 have decreased significantly. A year ago our 2022 funding requirement stood at $382 million. As a result of the robust plan returns last year, this is decreased to $159 million, and for 2023 our funding requirement has decreased to $375 million compared to $455 million at the end of 2018. ","As we indicated during the third quarter, the lower interest rate environment has resulted in a higher pension liability, but our funded status has improved to 79% compared to 77% at the end of 2018.","As you know, we normally only mark the pension at year end, but we will need to remeasure it again when FES emerges from bankruptcy. Assuming that they emerge in the first quarter of this year, we anticipate an after tax, non-cash loss of up to $400 million based on the discount rate and pension performance. ","Finally, our corporate liquidity continues to be strong with $3.5 billion of undrawn credit facilities and approximately $465 million in cash. This cash position, plus a portion of revolver borrowings will fund the final payment of $853 million to FES upon their emergence. ","Please keep in mind, 2020 will be a transitional year from a rating agency perspective, as this final FES payment will impact our credit metrics. However, when you exclude this payment, our 2020 credit metrics will be compliant with the thresholds established by each of the three rating agencies. ","With respect to equity, we have no incremental needs through 2021 and as we told you at EEI, we plan the issue up to $600 million of equity annually in 2022 and 2023. The ultimate amount will be determined by a number of factors, including customer load, storm activity, weather trends, pension performance and rating agency metrics. ","Thank you. We are proud of our results in 2019 and we look forward to continuing our strong progress this year. Now, let's take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. ","Greg Gordon","Hey, thanks. Congrats on a good year guys. ","Chuck Jones","Good morning Greg. ","Greg Gordon","A couple of questions. Looking at the cash flow disclosure you gave, there's some changes relative to what the outlook looked like in the last fact book, but I guess when I unpack it, it looks like the major changes, just the delay in the cash payment to the FES creditors and a decision to pay them out in cash rather than take on that tax note associated with the prior settlement. So can you just walk through \u2013 I know the former is just timing, but the decision making on the latter and why you see that as value accretive? ","Steve Strah","Hey Greg, it\u2019s Steve Strah. So the way you\u2019ve explain it is exactly what happened. We were planning to make the payment in 2019, assuming an FES emergence at that point, but obviously that didn't happen. It's going to happen here sometime in February, at which point in time we will fund the cash payment of $225 million and we will also pay what we were previously thinking would be issued as a tax note, we will also pay that tax note in cash. And so from an economics perspective it just makes more sense for us to use cash-on-hand to pay-off that tax note now, rather than have to deal with it by the end of 2022 and refinance it again at that point. ","Chuck Jones ","And I'll just emphasize that point, that means we won't be answering questions about FES for the next five years so. ","Greg Gordon","No, we're all happy about that. Two more questions; as it pertains to just you know obviously a lot of moving parts when you think about the \u201822 and beyond equity, potential equity needs, you've set up to $600 million. But one of the pieces that looks like its gotten better is, pension performance means future pension contributions are down by a little over $300 million. So all things equal, does that mean that your equity needs are down by potentially up to $300 million?","Chuck Jones","Well, I would say this, we put a range in there that allows for flexibility for lots of things to change between now and then. The range of zero to 600, including the drip is a range that we expect to stay in. I don't think it should be extracted that it will be $600 million every single year, but it will be within that range, depending on where we are at when we get to that point.","Greg Gordon","Right, that\u2019s a fair enough answer. My final question is, I know this has no direct economic impact on your \u2013 definitely it has an impact on your customers. What do you think the Ohio government's response is going to be to the FERC decision on the MOPR rules with regard to, the capacity market? Is it possible that the state of Ohio will consider leaving PJM throughout FRR? ","Chuck Jones","I would say that the state of Ohio has already kind of talked about their disappointment with the PJM market, and their intention to use the next year or so to look at energy policy for the state. The last time they looked at energy policy in the state was 20 years ago, 1999, when the Senate Bill 3D regulated the state. ","I think there's a lot of disappointment that some of the goals they thought would be achieved through that, never materialized. I think there were some unintended consequences that happened that they didn't expect to happen and so I think they're going to fully look at everything, from how the utilities interact with the public utilities commission to you know how we insure a long term secure supply of generation for Ohio customers, to how we get back to Ohio being a state that has an energy surplus as opposed to a shortfall. ","I think there's a lot of things they are going to look at, but beyond that, you know what our intention is, is we\u2019ll be at the table helping where they want help, providing our guidance where they want guidance, and expressing our views where we feel strongly about certain things should go a certain way. ","Greg Gordon","Do you feel strongly about FRR one way or the other? ","Chuck Jones","I don't, I'm not in the generation business anymore, so \u2013 but I feel strongly that we need to come up with a long term solution for customers that ensures they have adequate, fuel secure, cost effective generation, not just right now. And I mean its no \u2013 my views on these markets has not changed. A one your capacity signaled three years out and the next hourly short run marginal cost signal is no way to do this business for the long haul and they are failing. And so something needs to be done, whether Ohio decides to step up and do something, is up to them, but I do not think the market as constructed today is going to provide the best long term outcome for my customers. ","Greg Gordon","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. ","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys! ","Chuck Jones","Hi Praful. ","Praful Mehta","Hi, so maybe just firstly clarify something more specific, on page 11 you have regulatory charges for the fourth quarter in the distribution business, which is being adding \u2013 which is adding back about $0.15 of earnings to get to more operating earnings. What specifically does that $0.15 relate to? ","Jason Lisowski","Yeah Praful, this is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. That is related to a FERC order that reallocates some transmission expenses across our utilities. And as you may recall, in Ohio we at the time in the past did not have the ability to pass those on to customers. So it ended up being actually a refund and a credit back to the wild companies, and since in the past we were excluding them from our non-GAAP operating earnings, when you receive that credit, we consistently also exclude it from our non-GAAP operating earnings. ","Praful Mehta","I got you. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then in terms of longer term growth, the \u201821 to \u201823 earnings profile based on the group that you've talked about looks like a 4.5% earnings growth, if I just were to use the math for the last two years. I'm assuming some of that is obviously a slower rate base growth and then the equity need. Can you just walk through or help us understand what kind of rate base growth you're assuming for the last two years in the current forecast and like how much dilution, you expect versus strong rate base to EPS. ","Chuck Jones","Well, I'll answer this. That CAGR that we\u2019ve given you have for the next five years is the CAGR that we expect to hit, which is 6% to 8% for the first three and then 5% to 7% after that.","I\u2019ll let Jason try to walk you through the rate base accounting that gets to that, but as I've told you many times, when you look at our company from the outside in, trying to line-up what you look at with the regulatory accounting that goes on, because it's no longer just the same simple math that it used to be. It\u2019s difficult, but we'll have Jason try.","Jason Lisowski","Yeah, if you look at the fact book that we released this morning, we actually do show our expected rate base growth, both separately for the regular distribution and regulate transmission, through 2023 broken down by each state. And you will see that in 2022 and 2023 there is no growth, but that growth does slow down a little bit. ","Praful Mehta","Okay, fair enough. I'll dig through that little bit more and discuss that. And then just finally on the equity needs point, I understand that clearly the pensioners helped, so that should help reduce the equity needs a little bit. ","I wanted to understand in terms of balancing other goals right around leverage, holdco debt what are the key guide post that we should be thinking about as you think about the equity up to 600, what could have bring it down apart from pension, what could kindly to lead to pushing it up, just few of those guide posts would be helpful. ","Chuck Jones","Well, obviously 1 thing that could help bring it down is if we eventually see some reasonable low growth throughout our footprint. Just a little bit a low growth can have a huge impact. We give a range for a reason. I mean what \u2013 the performance of the pension plan can continue to affect what's needed there. You know it's \u2013 you know I wasn't trying to dodge Greg's question, I can't sit here today and tell you how much equity we're going to recommend we issue in 2022, \u201823, \u201824. It's not going to be more than $600 million, I can confidently say that. ","Praful Mehta","Got it. I really appreciate it guys. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey, good morning team. ","A - Chuck Jones","Good morning Julian.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey. So perhaps just to pick up on a slightly different state and angle, can you talk a little bit more about New Jersey and the energy masterplan here and specifically, how do you see opportunities emerging from that and\/or some of your peers and their respective clean energy filings in parallel. I'm thinking you know AMI or otherwise. ","And then as well, can you touch on some of the commentary in the EMP with respect to reduction or a meaningful reduction in gas and obviously you guys aren\u2019t gas, but conversely how do you think about the electrification implications that seem to be pretty clear in the EMP as well. So perhaps touch holistically on the New Jersey business given everything going on if you don't mind. ","A - Chuck Jones","Okay, well, there\u2019s a lot in that question. I was just over in New Jersey last week. I met with three of the BPU commissioners. I met with the Governor and his policy team, the afternoon after he rolled out the energy masterplan, so I had a lot of opportunity to talk with him and his team in particular about how I think our company can help him be successful with it. ","I think there are opportunities for us to help particularly in the electric vehicle area if the state decides to embrace utilities investing and you know building out a robust charging network throughout the state. You know, I think advanced metering is something the state has to decide what their policy is on, but we've got a lot of experience now in Pennsylvania with nearly 2 million meters there and we're going to be rolling out a 0.25 million in Ohio. So what I offered is, we'll come to the table and help them understand the pros and the cons, because there are both that we see, to help them make an informed decision on that. ","I was very honest with him that I have no intention to get into investing in offshore wind. That's not something I see us taking on at this point in time. I talked with him about transmission and I know the BPU President made some comments about transmission, so I might as well just address those here, because I know I'm going to get a question. ","You know his comments were specific to the network transmission service charges in the BGS auction for one company and that company was not us by the way. I saw what happened in the market with our stock yesterday after his comments became public. ","I think the market should be smart enough to figure out that that involved one company. It should also be smart enough to figure out as he said at the end, that FERC sets transmission rates not the BPU, and they are not going to set different ones for New Jersey than they do everywhere else. It should also be smart to figure out that what we've told you all along is 90% of our transmission capital investment is in states other than New Jersey, and 90% of all of our $3 billion of investment is in states other than New Jersey. ","But what I talked to the Governor and his team about is the fact that you know our transmission plan, if we work together can be complementary to what he's trying to do with his energy masterplan, and actually enabling of what he wants to do with his energy masterplan and they were very receptive to that, and we agreed to continue to work together to figure out how to make that happen. ","So you know all-in-all, I think FirstEnergy is at the best place that it's ever been in New Jersey in terms of our relationships, in terms of the things that we're doing, in terms of you know us being trusted advisors to the Governor's office on his energy masterplan. There was nothing in that energy masterplan that scares me in any way, but there are pieces and parts that I think we can help more on and there's pieces and parts that we don't want to be part of. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","But just to clarify on that, could this be incremental capital? I know you guys talked about a very specific and committed equity capital plan and financing plan through the forecast period, but I just also hear your comments about you know helping the city of New Jersey here too. ","A - Chuck Jones","The reason we have a range in this CapEx plan that we've communicated is so that we have the ability to have flexibility to move it around state-to-state, transmission-to-distribution. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're going to add incremental capital beyond the range that we've given you, and the range that we're giving you is got a couple of control rods in it. ","One is our customer's ability to pay and a constant awareness of the fact that without load growth these are going to be rate increases for customers and we have to be careful with that, and the other control rod being the balance sheet and managing the amount of equity that we are ultimately going to do to maintain our credit where we want it and get to that goal of begin BBB rated with all three agencies. So we're going to use this range that we have to satisfy what we're going to execute from a work plan in all five states. I'm not planning to change that range in the near term. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Alright, great. Well, best of luck. Thank you. ","A - Chuck Jones","Thanks Julian. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Chuck, you only really owned kind of regulated generation in one state, West Virginia. Just curious how you're thinking about kind of the potential for kind of changes to the generation fleet, the composition of the generation fleet, maybe especially since the state kind of sitting on the Marcellus shale whether the economics makes sense for the company and the customer to add a little bit more gas fired generation into the regulated mix there. ","And then obviously, is there a need for kind of an uptick in either renewable or even kind of smart grid [ph] on the distribution side CapEx in West Virginia. ","A - Chuck JonesWell, you make a good straight man, because you can help me re-emphasize the point that one of the things that I think differentiates us from many others in our sector is we are a transmission and distribution company by and large. There are four states that are deregulated, so we don't own generation there and that creates a risk profile that's very low risk. We don't have the risks that go along with owning massive fleets of generating plants, particularly coal and coal waste disposal sites and so forth. ","In West Virginia the process is real simple. We're going to file an integrated resource plan in West Virginia by the end of this year. We'll share our ideas with West Virginia about where we see their capacity needs being, some thoughts on how to meet that, but those decisions are going to be made in conjunction with the state of West Virginia and you know I think that there are opportunities to embrace what's going on with the shale development and they are capitalizing on it with a lot of industrial growth in that state in terms of collection and compressing and so forth. ","Whether they want to capitalize it in terms of generation sources, that remains to be seen and I don't want to speak for the state of West Virginia, but up until now at least, they haven't been real welcoming to renewables there, but you know from a FirstEnergy perspective, as we get separations from this whole FES issue and put that behind us, I think investment in renewable generation in a regulated context is something that we need to be thinking about adding to our portfolio, not deregulated in any fashion. ","We worked so hard to get to this company that I just said. It\u2019s a T&D company\u2019s low risk, no exposure to markets, that's where we want to stay. Any generation we might invest in is going to be earning a regulated rate of return just like those two plants in West Virginia do. ","Michael Lapides","Got it. One other question, totally unrelated. Just curious, can you \u2013 what's embedded in guidance in terms of kind of O&M growth rates across the distribution business and also at the corporate level? ","A - Chuck Jones","What\u2019s embedded in our guidance is keeping O&M flat over that period, and so what I've challenged the team to do is to get more efficient at how we deliver service to customers. We\u2019re in the process of rolling out an innovation center of FirstEnergy. ","We've got a number of employees who have earned black belts in innovation engineering. We're going to put them all into one group. We're going to use that group to help drive innovation throughout this company as a way to make us more efficient and offset the annual \u2013 you know we give a 3 in it this year, a 3.5% wage increase on the average to our employees, you know about half of which ends up O&M. You know we've got to find a way to offset, but what's in the guidance period is flat O&M throughout that period. ","Michael Lapides","Got it. Starting off of 2019 base or starting off 2018 base, was there anything unusual in 2019?","A - Chuck Jones","Starting off of the \u2013 when we finished FE tomorrow and finished dealing with our corporate costs, which by the way our T&D costs are bottom decile as far as O&M and our corporate costs are bottom quartile in terms of low being good in both cases. So we've got this company very lean and we expect to keep it that way throughout this period. ","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated. ","Chuck Jones","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Charles Fishman ","Yeah Chuck, 90% of your transmission now, in that one slide you showed was formula based, forward looking. And what gets you to that last 10%? Is it a process similar to what we saw in New Jersey and what's the timing on that do you think?","A - Chuck Jones","Well its \u2013 what\u2019s left, that is not forward looking formula rates is the former Allegheny system, and yes, the process would be to either eventually merge that into one of our existing Transcos or form another Transco, but the timing is what is such that we\u2019ll do that when it makes the best sense in terms of there will be a crossover point where the investment returns, you know more returns to shareholders in a forward looking formula rate than it does in a stated right. Right now the stated rate is better for all of you. ","Charles Fishman ","Okay. And then second question, when we last talked in November, you hadn\u2019t finished the planning process and you wanted to hold off on guidance till \u201823. As you wrapped up that process, in your mind was there anything that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, surprise is probably a too strong of a word, but maybe was a little different than you thought as you wrapped up that process? ","A - Chuck Jones","No, not at all. I mean, I think it's very difficult to predict the future five years out, though a lot of what we had to get comfortable with in that planning process is what's the world going to look like, not today, but what's the world going to look like in 2023; you know what's going to happen with inflation, what's going to happen with growth, etcetera, etcetera and bracket those types of things. ","One thing I can tell you I am confident in is that we're going to execute on the plan that we put out to this company and if it's $3.2 billion or $3.3 billion or $2.9 billion, it's going to deliver the results that we intend to deliver, and by getting to the point where more than 60% of all of it is in formula rates. It\u2019s very transparent and easy to calculate, and where we need to have rate cases, we're going to have them, just as I said. ","We\u2019re going to file a rate case probably this month in New Jersey to get that trued up and recover some storm costs that you know we've deferred up until now, so our ability to execute on rate cases, we demonstrated we can do that too, but it was just really more getting comfortable with a range of outcomes that could happen between now and then, to get comfortable with the CAGR and get comfortable with the equity assumptions, both. ","Charles Fishman ","Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you. ","A - Chuck Jones","And the only other thing I've added and I said this repeatedly at EEI, I'm not going to tell you something until I know. The engineer in me is still in there. We got to have the plan and we got to have the numbers work and I know we can execute on it, which is why I was probably a little slow in getting to a five year CAGR, but that's also what results in five straight years now, meeting or exceeding every single quarter that we've given you guidance. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. ","Andrew Weisel ","Hey, good morning everybody.","Chuck Jones","Good morning. ","Andrew Weisel ","My first one, I just want to follow up on the New Jersey questions earlier. I believe in the CapEx outlook, do those forecasts include some level of spending related to things that were covered by the energy masterplan like energy efficiency, EV\u2019s, AMI and will those buckets be part of the upcoming JCP&L rate case filing or would they come later in a separate compliance filings or something like that?","Chuck Jones","No, they don't include anything for that. Right now it's about $175 million in transmission. You know what the IIP is. We're going to round out the first round of IIP and at some point in time hopefully you'll see IIP 2 just like you saw LTIIP II in Pennsylvania. And when that comes again, that's why we have a range of CapEx, so that we have the ability to have flexibility from state to state and T2D.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So that would be upside to the current numbers, if they were to be spending on that?","Chuck Jones","Might be upside in New Jersey, but it would probably come away from somewhere else. I mean you can count on the capital plan being what I've told you it is, and we're going to get the CAGR that I've told you we're going to get, but the pieces and parts of it may move around from state to state.","Andrew Weisel","Got it, that's helpful. And then last, this is just kind of a small one, but in Pennsylvania, congratulations on getting the LTIP 2 approved in full. My question is on the DSIC Rider, the benchmark ROE was just reduced by 10 basis points I believe yesterday to 9.45. Does that apply to your subsidiaries? And if so, can you give any sort of earnings sensitivity? I know this just came out yesterday, so it didn't give you a whole lot of time, but any thoughts on that?","Chuck Jones","Eileen's on top of it.","Eileen Mikkelsen","Good morning. It's Eileen Mikkelsen, I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Thank you, Chuck. ","Yes, we are aware that the PaPUC reduced the benchmark for the ROE in Pennsylvania yesterday to 9.45. Where that benchmark is used is really relates to our DSIC calculation and four utilities that have not had a base rate case in the last two years. They substitute that ROE benchmark number into their calculation when they calculate their DSIC revenues. ","So for our four distribution utilities in Pennsylvania, going forward we\u2019ll use in our return calculations a return on equity of 9.45%, rather than the 9.55% that we've been using in the past, which really is the 10 basis points across those DSIC calculations, immaterial change to the revenues that we\u2019ll collect under those riders.","The second thing that ROE benchmark is used for is really a customer protection to say to the extent that the utilities have earnings in excess of that benchmarks that they report in their quarterly earnings reports. If they exceed that benchmark, they will then have to turn off their DSIC recovery until such time as their earnings fall below that. ","So we've looked at those numbers overnight. We're confident that it doesn't change our outlook for DISC collections during the planning horizon. I would put a caveat on it to say, we do have a settlement pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission to increase the cap we have in Penn Power. So assuming that's approved, we expect to be able to continue to collect DSIC across all of our utilities throughout the planning period.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great, that's very helpful. You mentioned Penn Power. Is there a potential for Penn Power rate case sometime soon?","Eileen Mikkelsen","I don't think we're expecting a Penn Power rate case over the planning horizon and largely that's because we were able to reach a settlement with the other parties in Pennsylvania that's pending before the commission to allow us to collect DSIC revenue up to 7.5% of our base distribution rates in Penn Power, where for all the other utilities it's capped at 5%. So that really allowed us to cover that additional investment through the DSIC Rider and eliminated the need for a base rate case.","Andrew Weisel","That's great. So Chuck, then is it fair to say that JCP&L might be the only rate case through 2023?","Chuck Jones","I'd say that's a fair way to look at where we're at today, yeah.","Eileen Mikkelsen","I would just \u2013 again, it's Eileen. I agree with Chuck. Put a caveat on it that we do have an obligation in 2023 to file an additional base rate case in the state of Maryland.","Andrew Weisel","Right, good reminder. Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Sophie Karp","Hi, good morning.","Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Sophie Karp","I have a question on load growth. So you guys clearly mentioned that it's one of the factors that can help offset equity needs or impact you're planning in a way, and despite sort of a strong overall economy, it doesn't seem like we\u2019ve seen a lot of that in Ohio or elsewhere, may be in new territories. Could you discuss that a little bit and maybe give us some sense of what you have seen on the ground and what can change that to actually see some positive load growth? Thank you.","Steve Strah","Sophie, this is Steve Strah. And we're conservative in terms of the load growth that we do put into our plan. And right now I believe we will see more of what we've seen in 2019 and that is basically flat load growth to slightly declining load growth. But I also \u2013 just looking at 2019 for a moment, you know we were down 1.1% and that was slightly lower than our guidance, which was 0.6%. ","So when we estimate it, we're pretty good at estimating where we're going to land, we didn't miss it significantly. And in terms of sensitivities, the 1% decline that we saw in 2019 versus the guidance really impacts earnings only about 2%, and that's really driven by the residential sector. ","Our commercial and industrial loads are really \u2013 and rates are fixed or having demand rates, which are not as impactful. So right now we do see the manufacturing recession continuing on in 2020 before we start to see recovery. We're hopeful to start to see that recovery in mid-year or a little bit later. So right now I would just say look forward to flat load growth within our territory. We don't really see that changing significantly.","Chuck Jones","So, the only thing that I would add that I think in the back half of this planning period that we're talking about that could be significant is this shell cracker plant in Western Pennsylvania, and empirically as economists look at the world, it's difficult to factor that in. But I just drove over there for a meeting last week. It's due to come online by end of 2021, so it's a year and a half away. ","It won't be a lot of load itself, because they are going to self-generate with the methane, that's a waste product of the cracking process, but the industrial load that's going to pop-up, and is already popping up, you're starting to see cranes in the air on other sites, I think can have an opportunity to jump-start this economy in Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, and we are now starting to see construction progress on the cracker plant in Ohio too. ","So the combination of both of those I think can be something that could be a good surprise and it's difficult to factor into the numbers.","Steve Strah","I would also add Sophie lastly, you know we are encouraged by seeing the two consecutive years of residential load growth. Albeit modest, we look at that as being very positive for some of the reasons I mentioned earlier. So I don't want to be too much of a downer at all.","Sophie Karp","Thank you.","Chuck Jones","And look, I mean you're in northeastern Ohio. I mean we've got forward investing of over $1 billion in two plants in northeastern Ohio. GM had just announced the state-of-the-art battery manufacturing facility in Ohio. The former Lordstown plant is being repurposed into an electric vehicle, light-duty, medium-duty truck facility. So when those things all get done, the job market and the economy is going to benefit from all of that. So in the back end of this planning period, I'm optimistic that we can see some growth.","Sophie Karp","Got it, thank you.","Chuck Jones","Okay, I see no other questions in the queue. So thank you again for your support, really over the last five years since I've been in this job, and you know I think we intend to have another year in 2020 just like we've had in the last five years. Expect to be a fully regulated company here by the end of this month with FES behind us and then just move on from there. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day!

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Beringer, you may begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, Jackie, and good afternoon.

I will now turn the call over to Tony Alexander.","Anthony J. Alexander","Thanks, Meghan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We will be reporting first quarter results, and quite frankly, they were solid despite the very mild temperatures that Mark will discuss in more detail. ","Based on these results and our continued confidence in our business strategy, we are reconfirming 2012 and 2013 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share and $3.10 to $3.40 per share, respectively. ","Turning now to a review of recent events. I'll start with an update on our actions to address new environmental regulations, including the plant retirements we announced earlier this year and the current cost expectation for compliance with those regulations at our remaining fleet. Finally, I'll look at recent state regulatory issues. Then Mark will discuss first quarter results, including recent economic activity across our region and review our retail strategy. ","Okay, let's get started. As you know, we announced plans earlier this year to retire units at 9 of our older coal-fired plants by September 1, 2012, as a result of the new EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, otherwise known as MATS and other environmental regulations. This includes units at 6 competitive plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania and 3 regulated plants in West Virginia. As a part of this process, PJM Interconnections conducted a review to determine the impacts these retirements could have on system reliability. ","In March, to address PJM's preliminary reliability concerns, we filed an application proposing approximately 800 megawatts of new combustion turbine peaking generation to be installed at our existing Eastlake plant. It is our intent to offer these units into PJM's capacity auction next week. If they clear the auction, we would begin construction efforts to meet a targeted in-service date of spring 2015. In addition, to bridge the ATSI region to early 2015, PJM's current planning assumption is for reliability must run arrangements, or RMRs, for Eastlake units 1 through 3, Lake Shore unit 18 and Ashtabula unit 5. This involves a total of 885 megawatts, which will help ensure reliable electric service for the Cleveland region. We anticipate that the RMR arrangements will be structured so that PJM will compensate us to keep the units available for operation through early 2015. At that time, we plan to go forward with retiring those units. In addition to the RMRs and the new combustion turbine generation at Eastlake, our transmission group, working with PJM, has identified a number of transmission projects that can be implemented over the next several years and are expected to also improve reliability in the ATSI zone. While we do not have final estimates for the cost of these transmission projects, we are currently projecting a capital spend of between $700 million and $900 million over the next 4 to 5 years. We expect to earn a return on these transmission investments from the time we begin construction. The remaining competitive units slated for retirement, Eastlake units 4 and 5, Bay Shore units 2 through 4, Armstrong and R. Paul Smith are expected to be retired as planned by September 1 of this year. The 3 West Virginia plants included in these announcements are regulated and we have provided the West Virginia Public Service Commission with information regarding the plant deactivations. We also anticipated deactivating these units by September 1. ","I know many of you are closely following the PJM capacity auction scheduled for next week. Just so we're all clear, we cannot and will not predict the pricing outcome of that auction. We believe the actions we are taking, building 800 megawatts of combustion turbine capacity at Eastlake and the transmission reliability projects, will benefit the region. We continue to fully support and encourage a utilization of competitive market mechanisms to provide the appropriate incentives to all market participants. ","Turning now to the investment required to address MATS at our remaining coal fleet. At our analyst meeting, we told you Jim Lash's team identified lower cost solutions and allowed us to cut our anticipated expenditures roughly in half, from $2 billion to $3 billion in our original estimate, down to $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. As we continue to find alternative approaches to meeting these requirements, including the possibility of coal firing certain units with natural gas, I can say that we are now comfortable with the lower end of the revised range. We expect to finalize our plans later this year, and we will continue our efforts to further reduce these costs if possible. ","Looking now at regulatory issues, starting with New Jersey, where the Board of Public Utilities has requested information about JCP&L's earned rate of return, we have received a procedural schedule from the BPU and filed a brief supporting JCP&L's position. We expect a board response in June. We provide financial information to the BPU quarterly and we continue to believe that JCP&L's electric rates are just and reasonable, and that the Rate Council's request does not provide sufficient reason for the BPU to order a base case rate at this time. ","Turning now to Ohio. In April, our Utilities filed an application with the PUCO for a 2 year extension through May of 2016 of our very successful Electric Security Plan. If approved, the extension would continue to allow Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison Company to establish retail generation prices for their standard service customers through a competitive bid process. While similar to the process now used by those companies, the proposed expansion will take the last 2 auctions under the current plan, which are scheduled for this coming October and January of next year, and extend the delivery time frame from 1 year to 3 years. This is expected to benefit the Ohio customers by mitigating potential price volatility that may otherwise occur. ","The current ESP, which has been in place since June of 2011, has resulted in price certainty, lower prices and more than $10 million in annual economic development funding and low income assistance to FirstEnergy's utility customers and communities in Ohio. More than 20 parties, including the majority of those who were signatories on our existing ESP have supported the new ESP. PUCO has a set of plans to hold hearings on our plan starting on May 21. If our proposed plan is approved in June, we would have the opportunity to capture lower wholesale generation prices and blend those market-based power prices throughout the new ESP period. ","Also in Ohio, FirstEnergy Solutions continues to be a strong advocate for competition in the Dayton Power & Light market rate offer and AEP Ohio's Electric Security Plan cases. In particular, AEP wants to restrict shopping in its territory by imposing above market capacity charges on competitive suppliers. These charges would severely limit the savings customers in the AEP territory, including a number of large governmental aggregation communities that passed ballot measures last fall, would otherwise achieve from competitive markets and in fact amounts to a windfall for AEP. We expect that PUCO to make a decision on the AEP case by mid-summer. Now I'll turn this over to Mark for a review of first quarter.","Mark T. Clark","Thanks, Tony. And like Tony, I'd like to welcome everyone this afternoon. Today, I will discuss first quarter results, and as part of that discussion, I'll touch on recent economic activity in our region and the continued progress of our retail strategy. As Tony mentioned, we delivered solid results during the quarter, excluding special items, first quarter 2012 non-GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share, compared to $0.75 per share in the first quarter of 2011. On a GAAP basis, this quarter's earnings were $0.73 per share, compared to $0.15 per share in the same period last year. I'll take a moment to remind you that earnings for the first 9 months of 2011, as well as earlier periods, were revised in connection with our adoption of the change announced in January, in the method of accounting for pensions and other post-employment benefit plans. ","Moving on now to a review of our first quarter results. As in the past, it may be helpful for you to refer to the consolidated report to the financial community we issued this morning. First, I'll take a moment to review the special items from the first quarter of 2012, which are detailed on Page 4 of the report. Special items have the net impact of decreasing this quarter's GAAP earnings by $0.09 per share. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2011, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.60 per share. Special items in the first quarter of 2012 included benefit of $0.06 per share for mark-to-market adjustments, which was offset by a $0.05 per share charge related to plant closings, which includes both revenue and expenses, as well as activities in preparation to deactivating the units. A $0.04 per share decrease in earnings related to merger accounting for commodity contracts, and a $0.02 per share related to tax legislative changes. There were also 4 special items that each reduced GAAP earnings by $0.01 per share. They were the impairment of nuclear decommissioning trust securities, merger costs, the impact of non-core asset sales and impairments and regulatory charges. ","Turning now to the other first quarter drivers, which are highlighted on Page 1 of the consolidated report. As we walk through these, we will once again discuss FirstEnergy on its stand-alone basis with the impact from Allegheny separated. Since there was only 1 month of the Allegheny results included in the first quarter 2011, beginning next quarter, our total company results will be presented in a combined year-over-year format. And in fact, the Allegheny contribution is one of the positive drivers of the first quarter, as it continues to be accretive to earnings, including the impact of shares issued in conjunction with the transaction. On a merger-related note, over the last weekend of March, we successfully completed the integration of our ITN business networks, which include about 100 different systems. While this was and will be a significant synergy item, it was also an important cultural milestone for our employees. It was a tremendous effort. I'm proud of our entire team for accomplishing this task in a remarkably short period of time. Another positive driver was lower operating costs. Last year, we had a first quarter refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2. This year we benefited from having all of our nuclear units in service, as well as from lower costs in our Fossil operations. And the final positive items were lower interest expense and revenue linked to excise taxes. Moving now to items that reduced first quarter results, and since it was such a significant factor during the quarter, I'll start with a discussion of the weather. Nationally, this was the fourth warmest winter in the last 117 years and the warmest month of March since 1950. We certainly experienced the same conditions in our region, where heating degree days were 25% below 2011 levels and 22% below normal. In fact, when we look at the impact of abnormal whether on our company as a whole, including all 10 utility companies and generation sales, the cumulative impact was $0.12 per share this quarter. Obviously this affects our full year earnings forecast, but as Tony said earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2012 and 2013 based on the strong performance of our retail business. Let's now turn to the distribution deliveries which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. The extremely mild weather resulted in a 4% decrease in total distribution deliveries. Residential deliveries decreased 8%, while commercial deliveries were down 2% and industrial deliveries were relatively flat for the company as a whole. However, consistent with the recent trend of growth in certain pockets of the regional economy, industrial activity continues to improve in Ohio. Sales to that group were up 3% versus the first quarter of 2011. As a number of our steel customers expand to meet demand from shale gas exploration, including a new mill at  the Republic Steel facility in Lorain, Ohio. As you know, our service territory sits directly atop both the Marcellus and the Utica shale formations. In addition to jobs and growth in the steel sector, this is also translating into an uptick in investment associated with drilling activity and infrastructure in our Pennsylvania and Ohio service areas. The state of Ohio had the fourth largest increase in job growth in the nation in 2011, and data is showing that 9% of the new employment is related to shale exploration. It's encouraging to see growth in our region and like everyone else, we are hoped to continue seeing more positive signs, especially in the commercial and residential sectors. ","Let's move now to commodity margin, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share overall this quarter. As always, when we discuss commodity margin, we're talking about the interplay of many different components. In each quarter we like to break out the positive and the negatives. A detailed summary can also be found on Pages 2 and 3 of the consolidated report, including additional information on megawatt hour volumes. Before I get into the individual elements of commodity margin, I'll note that generation output from our ongoing competitive fleet, which excludes those units we plan to retire or deactivate, decreased by 2.4 million megawatt hours or 13% compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting lower demand and soft power prices. Nuclear output increased due to the absence of any refueling outage in the quarter. This was offset by a lower output from our supercritical fossil generation and lower utilization of our subcritical fleet, which continues to be impacted by low natural gas prices. While our coal inventory increased with the decline of Fossil output, we also took advantage of certain market opportunities to build our inventory above what we would consider typical levels for this time of year. This had a negative impact on cash in the first quarter, which we expect to reverse over the remainder of the year. Let's move on to the 5 items that decreased commodity margin. These include: increased capacity expense as a result of FES serving more retail load; higher purchased power cost, chiefly related to economic purchases; a reduction in FES wholesale electricity sales to the spot market; lower sales of Renewable Energy Credits; and finally, a decrease in net financial hedges associated with the FES sales in generation portfolio. ","Looking now at the 4 positive elements of commodity margin. First, our generation fleet earned high-capacity revenues in connection with ATSI's June 2011 transition from MISO to PJM. We also experienced lower PJM congestion, network and transmission line loss expense. Fuel expenses were lower, primarily related to the impact weather had on demand. And finally, FirstEnergy Solutions continues to successfully execute its retail strategy by hedging or selling forward to retail customers and by shifting sales volumes within and among retail channels, we believe we have significantly mitigated the financial impact of the weakness in the wholesale markets. ","Contract sales increased 9% in the quarter, as FES experienced a 28% increase in direct sales, a six-fold increase in NAS market sales and nearly 1 million megawatt hour increase in structured sales. A significant portion of the growth in direct and NAS market sales took place outside our traditional footprint in markets including Central and Southern Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey. Government aggregation sales were lower for the quarter as the result of weather, but FES continues to successfully expand this channel. In fact, you'll recall that 50 communities in Central Ohio voted to adopt governmental aggregation for their electric service last November. FES won 42 of those contracts, or about 90% of those communities that have selected a supplier and began service to some of those communities during the first quarter. While FES had a similar impact associated with weather, their success at increasing the movement of sales from polar to direct and the movement within and across channels essentially offset a portion of the negative weather impact. FirstEnergy Solutions' hedged position for the balance of 2012 is now at 91%, and we are at 60% for 2013. Let me close with a brief overview of our financing activities. As I referenced earlier, we are in the process of putting together a new $1 billion transmission company credit facility, and extending our existing $4.5 billion credit facility by 1 year through 2017, which will provide us with a solid liquidity position going forward. We are also in the process of negotiating the early buyout of the 1987 Bruce Mansfield sale leaseback arrangement, which will take a future obligation off the table opportunistically. And finally, this quarter we plan to file an application seeking a financing order with the PUCO under the new Ohio securitization legislation, as we've already announced. Together, these initiatives continue our progress towards the financial initiatives outlined last year and at our February Investor Day. Combined, these initiatives place us in a much stronger position for the increase in capital program over the next several years. As Tony mentioned, we are aggressively managing our MACT spend, and now expect to be at the low end of the $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion range we announced at the February analyst meeting. That is well down from the initial $2 billion to $3 billion estimate and importantly, we continue to evaluate options for further reductions. We're also addressing incremental capital spending related to building 800 megawatts of combustion turbine generation at Eastlake, as well as the projected transmission reliability investments all over the next 4 to 5 years. Although we will continue to assess our overall capital program, we are likewise evaluating our funding opportunities for these projects. As Tony said, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, and more important, we are confident that we are on track to meet our goals and guidance for the year. Thanks for listening. And now I'd like to open up the call to your questions. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It looks like you guys are on course to get the customer shift you were looking for, but the EPA issues have probably complicated the story a little bit. If they were to be successful in front of commission and you do see the reversal in the shopping caps, how would the mix shift that you guys saw this quarter potentially reshuffle if you started mitigating some of the contracts because the capacity prices got goofy?","Anthony J. Alexander","I think it wouldn't change our strategy at all. I mean, we've got aggregated communities that voted to aggregate. As I said earlier, Dan, we've moved additional load into Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois. So there are a lot of markets outside of Central Ohio, but we're really pleased with where the retail group is and what they've been able to do, particularly shifting megawatt hours within channels and into different markets. So I don't think it would change what we're doing one iota.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then on the coal generation side, with the low output on the sub-criticals and the super-criticals as well, can you talk a little bit about your coal supply considerations and inventories and if you're continuing to shift your expectations for coal generation output for the year versus the analyst day?","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes, I think that's a great question. We are shifting our focus. We had some opportunities to build up our coal inventory in the first quarter. Those opportunities are no longer are there and we will be reversing that and actually burning down our inventory over the last 9 months of the year. And on a cash basis, we expect to end about where we thought at the beginning of the year. So cash to cash, it's about even. We just took advantage of some opportunities and we're pleased where we are. But a little long from where we would normally be, but nothing out of the norm.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So we shouldn't be perpetuating the 16% utilization rate on the sub-criticals for the rest of the year, I guess, is the punchline?","Anthony J. Alexander","No, I wouldn't.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about the retail business. It looks like you've had great success in expanding your sales there. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in the context of the pricing that you're getting on sales relative to -- as you see trends in power prices relative to hedge prices, are you seeing the ability to weather the storm in terms of the economics of hedges relative to changes in just power prices which are driven by gas? Are you seeing that sort of as a -- is that turning out to be a good buffer or are hedges on that side following directly along with power price moves?","Anthony J. Alexander","I'd take for this year, 91%'s already sold. So it's not going to have much impact next year at 60%. One of the avenues that we're using to address the power prices, and I think our retail group's done a great job is understanding the margin within each channel within each EDC, within each channel, so we can move megawatt hours between EDCs to try to generate higher margin and then move between channels themselves to generate higher margin on the same megawatt hour, so power prices being power prices what they are, there is a certain reality to it, but we're pretty comfortable with where we are, we're getting away from the polar, more on to the direct, more contract, extending some of the contracts out for longer terms. I think we're pretty comfortable. I don't know. Bill, do you want to add anything?","William D. Byrd","I agree with everything Mark said.  It's 5 to 1 [ph], so I mention that the, inevitably, over time, our retail revenue will reflect market conditions if they don't change, but that movement to market will take years given our retail strategy. It's not something that would occur very quickly.","Operator","Our next question's coming from Stephen Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question regarding your comments on the funding some of the new projects such as the transmission. At one point in time, you had talked about potentially selling transmission or the like. And I'm just curious if the funding opportunities could be something where you would think about separating out transmission in some way, or is it more likely traditional sources?","Anthony J. Alexander","I think it's more traditional sources. Transmission right now is a strong contributor to earnings. It helps support the dividend. It generates a nice return. I think Jim is looking at the more traditional sources of funding. I don't know if you want to speak to that. But no, I -- we're not looking at selling any transmission asset or anything like that. We're just trying to fine tune what the MACT spend is going to be. We're trying to fine tune what demand sell lease purchase price is going to be, and in the context of all of that, we'll be tweaking our overall funding strategy.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one other question is just, maybe I don't know if maybe Bill wants to address this, but just the change in dynamics in PJM, coal to gas switching, some of the things they've seen. Is it affecting in any significant way that the basis of your different generation assets that's meaningful to the value of those assets? Or is it not that big a difference?","William D. Byrd","It's not really that big of a difference. The basis has shrunk with the decrease in overall market levels, but we aren't seeing anything that wouldn't be explained with consistent movement with the overall market.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first on the transmission CapEx what you delineated there over the next 4 to 5 years, in terms of timing, is that sort of nearer term or is that toward of '15, '16, '17 spending, primarily?","Anthony J. Alexander","That's a good question. I just spoke to the head of our Utilities group yesterday about that question. It's pretty even. There's a little bump up in '14, a little bump to '15, but it's not outrageous or anything like that. It's fairly smooth over the period of time, but we're just really, to be honest with you, in the initial phases of it, they're doing a lot of work, we have asked them to look at different things. This is probably similar to MATS. We get into it, we start looking at different options, scenarios, trying to figure out different ways to reduce our cost. So it's, I would say for planning purposes, it's smooth, but it is very, very preliminary.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And how much of that is at risk around potential competitors trying to do comparable transmission projects, it would seem?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, I think the utilities are going to do the projects, or they could assign them to ATSI or TrAIL or one of those, I don't, I mean that thought's never even crossed my mind. So...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's a good sign. And then frankly, on cost-cutting, looks like a pretty strong first quarter here. What is the trend year-to-date? How are we looking, maybe more structurally beyond that? I know you guys always kind of take a hard line.","Anthony J. Alexander","I think one of the biggest benefits as we're still seeing the synergy savings I alluded to. Having all of our systems integrated now means that all of our operating groups are on the same working platform. It also means that we can start reducing the size of the IT staff, because they're all integrated. So I think those of you that know Tony know that he's never satisfied with us unless we're taking a hard look at all of our expenses.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just a quick last one on DR. You guys alluded to on the ESP, with regards to potential bidding and some incremental into the upcoming auction, but that depended on the timing of the approval. Could you maybe talk about how much incremental DR you're thinking about, I mean, that's not asking about forecasting price or anything, but just anecdotally between yourselves and others, what you're kind of seeing out there?","Leila L. Vespoli","Hello, this is Leila. With respect to the demand response, we would have needed a commission order before the capacity option. Given the current schedule that is not going to happen. So I would not anticipate any demand response being embedded into the capacity option. And let me explain the rationale for that. Our current ESP only goes -- it ends the day before the period of the next auction would start. So in terms of what the Utilities would have to bid, they don't have any customers, they don't have a tariff that would be in place for that period of time, so it would be impossible for them to bid any demand response into the auction. So by missing the deadline, at least that portion of what we had contemplated going forward within on the ESP would drop off. But as Tony mentioned, there are still other benefits associated with the ESP that would hopefully require a timely order by the commission.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hello, guys. I was just -- on the transmission investment again, sorry to come back to this. Could you give me a little bit more detail about what kinds of things, these -- are they lines or is it upgrading of substations and the like? And are these upgrades embedded in the parameters that PJM modeled, so when they did the remodel of the auctions. So I know you've been in talks with them about how to address reliability. So just curious how that works into the planning process.","Anthony J. Alexander","Now Jonathan, we can give you a little bit of detail on that, and I think both of these projects have been identified as part of the PJM process. So I'll give you a high level, Bill can fill in the details. But probably 3 major components. One there'll be some substation enhancements that'll be added to the system. So we'll be expanding several substations and perhaps even adding a couple in the process. We plan on taking some of the existing generation resources that are being retired and adding or making them synchronized condensers, and third would be long lines. We have some open towers that we will be stringing additional wire on into the region and more longer-term, probably an additional line into the Cleveland area. So those are basically the components. So it's really structural in terms of substations, fold-in support through synchronous condensers, and some additional lines going into the region.","William D. Byrd","Jonathan, if you would contact our investor relations folks after the meeting, they can provide you with a link to the PJM website. PJM posted a document last Thursday that delineates each and every transmission project. There's 4 to 5 dozen projects and additionally, they can provide you with a link to a -- the meeting material from the PJM transmission expansion advisory committee meeting on Friday, which gives you more detail and information on these projects that you can ever hope to digest.","Anthony J. Alexander","Was my summary okay? I gave you the highlights, you can get into the details later, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I'm taking that to mean that then most of these are in a kind of they're out there and known about.","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes, 1 of the 3 buckets.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and can I ask on one other thing. I noticed in your commentary about sales in the quarter you'd sort of attributed the decline mostly to mild weather, which seems to suggest that there was some underlying pressure on usage that that wasn't explained by weather. Is that what you're saying and could you comment on such usage generally what you're seeing with customers?","Anthony J. Alexander","I think -- hopefully, I said the opposite. Weather was a significant driver. Residential obviously is weather driven. Commercial, generally the smaller commercial, is weather driven. Industrials were flat. Ohio industrials are up 3%, and we're seeing a lot of good shifting of margin within and around the channels of the retail group. So in the FES's case, they've actually offset some of the weather impact. So I would say it's the opposite.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Within distribution mark, when you kind of made the comment about of just deliveries, so not so much about your margins but just more what you're seeing in underlying trends.","Anthony J. Alexander","I think the underlying trend for the quarter was weather. And then industrials are flat across the system, but up in Ohio. Our head of our Utilities group mentioned to me this morning they're adding a third shift up at the Ford facility in Cleveland. That's the first time they've had a third shift in I can't recall when. Lordstown just got off 3 shifts working 24 hours a day. You've seen a lot of investment activity. I guess I'd have to say I'm optimistically positive.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In your 2012 earnings guidance, the uplift from a full year of Allegheny was $0.26 I believe, and that looks like it dropped to $0.17. What drove that, just weather?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't know. Harvey?","Harvey L. Wagner","I would say it's just operations. Right.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But that $0.26 was -- also has been captured in the first quarter, correct?","Harvey L. Wagner","No, I think weather in first quarter attributable to Allegheny was $0.02. I'd have to sit and -- I don't know.","Anthony J. Alexander","We can do a more granular analysis for you offline.","Irene M. Prezelj ","Give us a call after the call, and we'll walk you through it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have to say I was very impressed by your ability to maintain your commodity margin largely intact even as power output fell by 1\/8. That really shows the retail strategy paying off. But my questions go to a couple of other points. I want to understand the sustainability of some of the earnings gains you had, particularly within commodity margin, your net MISO PJM transmission turned into a contribution this year of $0.10. And is that something that's likely to reverse? Is that related to the low levels of power demand? Or is it related to the re-dispatch plan from the low gas price environment? Or is this something that we can expect to see again in the future?","William D. Byrd","Hugh, this is Bill Byrd. That's largely reduced congestion expense on the grid, relative to historical periods.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. I understand, but is it something that we'd like to see or expect to see again? Or do you think it's related to the low level of power demand or the re-dispatch of the power plants? Or something that's likely to reverse in the future?","William D. Byrd","I'm not sure I'd say it's likely to reverse, but it certainly reflects current market conditions and will reflect future market conditions.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then similarly on your O&M, you mentioned that the O&M expense is down, partly due to the absence of the nuclear refueling and the lower Fossil O&M expense. Is that a gain in earnings power that we would likely see reduced in future if the load following plants would operate at more normal levels?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't think so. I think we'd look at whether we'd do an economic purchase or run our own units, particularly the subcritical units. Clearly, we're better when the nukes are running, they dispatch lowest possible cost of our fleet. No, I wouldn't say that would be the case. I think we've done more economic purchases with some of the lower power prices. Nukes are running flat out, and the critical units are running itself. No.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I don't think we're quite not talking about the same thing, though. I'm not talking about purchase power, just the operation and maintenance expense. Is the low operation and maintenance expense related to the low operation of the load-following plants?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, we're not going to spend money on overtime. We're not going to spend a lot of money given the low power prices. We're not going to accelerate units coming back online justified, unless the price justifies itself. If the price stays down, we'll run the units commensurate with where the market is.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And consequently, incur the lower O&M?","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes, yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gregg Orrill of Barclays Capital.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the lower estimate for the MAC spending and what's behind that?","Mark T. Clark","Oh I think in the main, Gregg, we are pushing very hard at looking at all of the options that are available to us. I think the first analysis was a, essentially a capital solution. The second analysis is what can we do to drive capital cost out and improve the overall operation of the plant. So for example, investigating using natural gas as a co-firing vehicle which reduces the amount of, obviously it reduces the amount of emissions you have to treat, and improves the overall efficiency of the equipment that is already on many of our large facilities. So we're just continuing to push hard on the engineering and the alternatives that might be available to continue to operate the fleet inside the EPA requirements, but with the least amount of capital as possible.","William D. Byrd","Sometimes I think it is as simple as challenging the assumptions and the concepts our engineers come up with.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So you guys said earlier that you expected that you would burn down some of your coal inventory by year end.","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I'm just wondering as we think about your bidding -- your dispatch behavior in the market, I mean, right now we're in a shoulder period. Gas is displacing ahead of coal. We're going to get into summer, and most of your power generation resources are going to be necessary to be utilized, but wouldn't coal still be dispatching as a sort of a peak resource and wouldn't you be cycling down in the off-peak, or how are you thinking about bidding behavior? Are you going to bid in at assuming spot price per coal, the weighted average cost of coal? Explain to me how, even with the dispatch order having flip-flopped, you still expect to be able to run the plants at a relatively low cost and burn down these piles. I'm just a little bit confused given what we sort of know to be what's happening in the marketplace.","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't know if I said we were reversing our dispatch order. We sold out 91% for '12, so we're going -- not to be selling a lot into the wholesale market anyways, we weren't planning on it. So, now Bill, you want to...?","William D. Byrd","And I think it's -- we're aren't talking about any radical change in anything. I think it's a change at the margin, if you will, during the past quarter and past winter. Maybe if we could back pyre instead of generated and save $0.10, we would make that decision on a daily basis. Going forward, we'll put more emphasis on the wear and tear that, that creates on the unit, and that same decision going forward, we would say let's generate the power and not buy it. So I think it's just a slight change in emphasis and how to balance the cost and economics, if you will, on the margin.","Anthony J. Alexander","Greg, I think that to Bill's point, if you assumed that coal was up maybe $100 million in cash for the quarter and we buy around $2.5 billion, you can get a sense that we're not talking about big changes to get back in line.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a follow-up on Hugh Wynne's question on the net MISO PJM transmission expense. If I understood you guys correctly, you see these market conditions are continuing and that benefits sort of going forward for some time, is that correct? Is that how we should think about?","William D. Byrd","Yes. This is Bill Byrd. One thing I forgot to mention in responding to Hugh, another aspect of that decreased congestion is first quarter of '11, a lot of our plants were still in MISO. Now they're all inside the fence of PJM and that helps not having to cross the interface, helps tremendously with our congestion expense and that will be a sustainable benefit, regardless of market levels.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the net financial sales and purchases that was sort of a negative $0.05. Can you elaborate a little bit about that?","Anthony J. Alexander","I'll let Bill comment too, but I mean you have the economic purchases and you have the revenue on the other side. So I don't know if that's what you mean.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, I'm just sort of wondering how we should think about that going forward?","William D. Byrd","Primarily those financial purchases were basis swaps per hit, basis hedges which were fixed for floating swaps. So when our underlying basis expense was lower, the hedge came out negative.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That makes sense. Okay. And then there was a court order that came out in Michigan with AEP's capacity formula rate case that you guys were a party to, that you guys I think protested, actually. And there was an order that came out yesterday. And I was wondering just what's your thought about that and perhaps the implications for how it might be related to what we see in Ohio, with the deferred case that AEP has there which you guys are also, I think, involved in. Any thoughts you'd like to share with us that?","Leila L. Vespoli","Paul, this is Leila. I haven't had an opportunity yet to read the order, but my sense about it is that it's a good signal in that they indicated to AEP that the proposed pricing might be high. There are a lot of good signals in that case, so obviously we'll be looking to that going forward because I think you're right in that it could be setting a tone for what happens here in Ohio. But I think what came out of Michigan yesterday was a positive side, a very positive side.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just on the energy efficiency impact on the ATSI situation does it serve what the DR, I guess that you were talking about earlier that I guess will not be bidded in now. Could you give us a sense as to how much that was in megawatts?","Leila L. Vespoli","The demand response if you kind of look at what we have in our current ESP under the tariff, roughly 200 megawatts. So that will be the asset that has not bid in. The energy efficiency component is actually a separate kind of thing. That piece of it will likely be bid to the auction, the upcoming auction.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then finally the distribution deliveries. Did that -- did those figures include the leap year? I'm sorry if I missed that.","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes.  Jackie, how about if we take one more -- we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Kit Konolige of Konolige Research.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","So maybe you could just review a little bit more, you talked about the total of 5 negative deltas in the commodity margin and 4 positives. Should we be able to think of these as some of the pluses and minuses being related or offsetting for example, wholesale sales are down, contracted sales are up, fuel expense versus purchase power. Can you discuss the offsets that kind of logically fit together there?","Mark T. Clark","Actually you were doing a pretty good job. So there are offsets and I think you were just going right down the list. If you do one, you have the other. Purchase power is maybe up for economic reasons, but fuel will be down. Wholesale, as we close out our position in '12 and we're already over 90%. You would expect to see lower wholesale sales, and market has an effect on that as well. So I think you've got it nailed pretty well.","Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today.

These results are in line with our expectations, and we are also reaffirming our 2013 non-GAAP earnings guidance range of $2.85 to $3.15 per share.","While I'm pleased with our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, the PJM capacity auction results for the 2016, 2017 period were disappointing. As in the past, we are not disclosing the number of megawatts from our competitive business that cleared the auction. However, as has been the case in other recent auctions, not all of our generating units cleared. Respecting the PJM auction, I believe that there are significant and fundamental flaws in the process. These flaws will not only impede investments in competitive generation resources and the development of a robust competitive market, but will also, ultimately, impact reliability. We will continue to work with PJM and others to address these flaws, and in some cases, loopholes that encourage gaming the system.","In the meantime, however, and in the wake of these auction results, we are taking additional aggressive steps to further reduce our costs and improve operational performance. We have thoroughly evaluated the economics of each of our plants as a result of the auction and current and future environmental regulations, most significantly, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS.","As you may recall, in 2012, shortly after MATS Rules were finalized, we announced plans to deactivate units at 9 of our older coal-fire generating facilities. As a result of our recent analysis, we announced plans to further trim our fleet and deactivate 2 additional power plants by early October. These are the 370-megawatt Mitchell Power Station in Courtney, Pennsylvania; and the Hatfield's Ferry Power Station in Masontown, Pennsylvania, which is a 1,710-megawatt facility. These deactivations are subject to PJM review for any reliability impacts.","The Hatfield Station is a large supercritical and scrubbed facility. And while the Mitchell Station is older, it is equipped with scrubbers. However, neither of these plants cleared in the 2016, 2017 capacity auction. And some of the individual units also did not clear in the 3 prior auctions.","Our analysis, among other things, consider that together, Hatfield and Mitchell represent approximately 10% of our total generating capacity, with about 30% of our estimated cost to comply with MATS regulations.","As a result of these closures, our MATS compliance costs are expected to decrease from around $925 million to approximately $650 million. And we continue to look for ways to refine and perhaps further reduce our expected MATS compliance costs.","The total reduction in capital over 5 years at these facilities, including $275 million for MATS, is approximately $500 million. From an earnings perspective, the closure of these facilities will be accretive by several cents annually going forward.","In addition to these decisions, we've also canceled or delayed certain investments in other generating facilities, which are expected to further reduce the capital needs in our competitive generation fleet by about $375 million over that same period. In total, this $875 million reduction in capital over the next several years is a vital component of our overall effort to manage cash effectively during this time frame.","We have also identified, and are implementing, additional cost opportunities across our organization. These actions include reductions to medical and other benefits, and additional organizational changes, including a reduction in staffing and corporate support and the elimination of certain open positions throughout the organization. Combined, these actions are expected to reduce costs by about 100 -- by a total of $150 million to $200 million annually, beginning in 2014, with some impact in 2013, as the changes are implemented. These savings will run through both expenses and capital, and we will have a better sense for the allocation as the savings are implemented.","We also announced that we will be moving to a cash balance pension plan for employees hired on or after January 1, 2014. While this will not impact current pension obligations, it should change our pension responsibilities over time.","While many of the changes in our operations will have an impact on our competitive business, they do not change our strategy. We have had, and plan to continue, our asset-backed retail sales strategy in which our objective is to sell up to 25% more than we can produce. This allows us to increase the utilization of our generating fleet throughout the year, and take greater advantage of retail sales during otherwise low-load periods.","Since our competitive production capability, however, is expected to be lower as a result of the plant retirements and perhaps further reduced by the Harrison and hydro transactions, we would expect that our future retail sales targets, consistent with our strategy, would also be less.","Even so from an actual sale standpoint, our total retail sales may only be slightly less than current levels. And more importantly, given our current book of business, we are in a position to be far more selective in our channel and customer activity.","Our strategy is about both volume and margin. For example, we have already booked more than 75 million-megawatt hours of channel sales for 2014 at prices above this year's. And through the remainder of this year, we anticipate locking in additional direct and POLR sales, as auctions are conducted.","We are also seeing improved margin in our recent contracts and overall margin improvement by not pursuing renewal of some customer load. So while the reduction in our competitive generation fleet will impact our production capability, we do not expect it to have an appreciable effect on our retail sales plans. I remain confident in our strategy and in the manner in which we are executing to deliver higher value to our shareholders.","Let me now move to a brief regulatory update, as Leila is unavailable to join us today. First, respecting the Harrison proceedings in West Virginia. We received FERC approvals for the proposed financing and transfers related to the transaction, and the West Virginia Public Service Commission hearings on the asset transfer were completed in late May. Briefs and reply briefs were filed by the parties in July. And with the conclusion of the regulatory proceeding, the commission may issue an order at any time. We are, however, currently in active settlement discussions with all parties in this case, and we are very hopeful that we can reach a resolution through this process.","I continue to believe that this transaction provides positive benefits to our Mon Power customers and the state of West Virginia. And over time, it will help maintain our rates in West Virginia at levels that are some of the lowest in the region.","Regarding the New Jersey generic proceedings on major storm costs. On May 31, the Board of Public Utilities clarified that the prudence of the 2011 major storm costs would be reviewed in the generic proceeding, with the goal of maintaining the schedule established for the base rate case, where recovery of such costs would be addressed. The board further indicated that it would review the prudence of our 2012 major storm costs in the generic proceeding, and the recovery of such costs would be considered through a Phase II in the existing base rate case or through another appropriate method to be determined at the conclusion of the generic proceeding. On June 21, we filed a detailed report of 2011 and 2012 major storm costs in this docket.","In the pending JCP&L base rate case, we will file rebuttal testimony this week refuting the testimony put forth by the Rate Council and other intervenors. Hearings on the base rate case are scheduled for mid-September through mid-November. We expect resolution in that case by the first or second quarter of 2014. It's important to note, however, that JCP&L has the lowest distribution rates in New Jersey and, in some cases, by a significant margin, despite having one of the more difficult areas to serve since it is exposed to some of the greatest tree-density in the state, as well as 74 miles of coastline.","Now turning to Ohio. In Ohio, as we mentioned during our last earnings call, the State Senate introduced legislation, Senate Bill 58, aimed at amending the current energy efficiency law that was originally passed in 2008 under Senate Bill 221. In June, the Senate Public Utilities Committee conducted a series of public hearings to determine whether these costs -- whether these costly mandates are serving Ohio's best interest, and to gather stakeholder input on what changes are necessary. We were very pleased to see Ohio business owners personally attend these hearings to express their concerns with the current law. We expect that Senate Bill 58 will be revisited when the House and Senate reconvene in the fall. In the meantime, we remain actively involved in this process with Ohio's other electric utilities and other key stakeholders to determine what measures will most effectively reduce the cost burden of these standards in future years.","Also in Ohio, the PUCO scheduled a series of workshops throughout the remainder of this year as part of a retail market investigation that the commission launched late last year. FirstEnergy is fully participating in these workshops, and we are sharing our thoughts on ways to create additional opportunities for suppliers to effectively compete.","We have a lot on our regulatory plate, but with 10 operating utilities in 5 states, it will probably not be unusual. We have good regulatory relations and we are working with capable commissions to address all of these matters and other matters that will arise over time.","Now let's turn to our 2013 financing plan. While Jim will provide additional details on our overall plan, I wanted to note that we continue to make significant progress. We recently became the first utility in Ohio to successfully take advantage of the new Securitization Act, which allowed us to redeem certain debt at our Ohio utilities. We also announced additional early debt redemptions at our Ohio utilities which, in combination with the Securitization, will put each of those companies in a very solid credit position.","And with an equity infusion from FE directly to FES, along with the retirement of debt at FES, we have substantially improved the credit metrics of that entity as well. Further, we recently completed the extension of our credit facilities through May of 2018, and we exercised the $500 million accordion option at the FE credit facility, which should provide sufficient liquidity to the company.","Combined with other -- the other actions we've taken since the beginning of the year, these are significant accomplishments in a very short period of time, and place our subsidiaries in a much stronger financial position.","Progress also continues on our plan to sell up to 1,240 megawatts of our unregulated hydro generation assets. First round indicative bids were received early in the quarter, and we are involving a handful of interested parties in the deep dive process. I expect that we will be in a position to take the next step in this process during the third quarter. Through the combined actions we've taken across the company to reduce cash expenditures, particularly, the reduction in our generating fleet CapEx, our equity needs have been reduced. As a result, we plan to issue equity only through a dividend reinvestment program and various stock-related benefit plans beginning later this year. This is expected to provide approximately $100 million on an annual basis based on the current stock price and the anticipated participation levels. Beyond this, we have no plans to issue additional equity at this time. This clarification of our plan should put to rest any further speculation regarding amount and timing of additional equity.","With respect to the dividend, as you know, our Board of Directors announced an unchanged quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share just 3 weeks ago. Our dividend continues to be supported by the strength of our combined regulated utility and transmission operations. As we reshape our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and reduce our capital and other operating costs, we will continue looking at opportunities for growth in our Regulated businesses, with a strong focus on those that will improve customer service and provide attractive near-term returns to the company. For example, we are making solid progress on the transmission projects that we outlined earlier this year. Portions of Black River Substation Ohio, as an example, is now in service and should be fully operational by September. We're also on-target with the construction of the major transmission line that will ultimately connect the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station to a substation in Lorain County.","In New Jersey, open houses were held in late June for our proposed Oceanview Reinforcement Project, which will build a new 230 kV transmission line to reduce -- to add redundancy to the system and meet the growing demand for electricity. And we are still planning to invest about $700 million through 2016, utilizing ATSI and TrAILCo to address reliability issues related to coal unit deactivations within our footprint.","We are also evaluating a number of additional opportunities within our service area that would further expand our transmission investments. Given the size of our transmission system and service area, the transmission investment opportunities that we have identified are in excess of $7 billion. While it would take us some time to further define the projects and related time frame, it is fairly clear that the opportunities within our footprint to grow our transmission business are substantial.","In our distribution business, we are looking at the potential for rate cases in certain jurisdictions. Mon Power would be one of those, upon the successful completion of the proposed Harrison, Pleasants transaction. But we are also actively reviewing the potential for rate cases in other jurisdictions to assure a timely recovery of capital.","Further, we are considering accelerated investments in smart meter technology, where such programs are supported by a regulatory policy. And we are looking for opportunities to expedite improvements in service reliability, as is being supported in Ohio, throughout our service area.","On the overall economic front, things are obviously not yet where we want them to be, but we continue to see progress and believe that the bottom is now behind us. Our sales have been relatively stable over the last 3 years and we are now seeing increasing housing starts, as well as significant growth in shale-related segments.","With continued growth and economic improvement, we expect to again see higher distribution sales over time. We continue to aggressively address our -- all aspects of our business: our generation fleet, our operations, our regulatory opportunities and our financial initiatives. And by taking advantage of growth opportunities across our businesses and reducing expenses, we believe we can continue to provide value to our shareholders. Our strong second quarter results, rigorous focus on cash management and our willingness to make decisions illustrate our ability to deliver even during tough economic times.","Thank you for your support. And now I'll hand the call over to Jim for a review of second quarter results.","James F. Pearson","Thanks, Tony. As we walk through the second quarter results, you may want to refer to the consolidated report, which was issued this morning and is available on our website.","As Tony mentioned, our strong results were solidly in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $0.59 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2012. On a GAAP basis, this year's second quarter results were a loss of $0.39 per share compared to earnings of $0.45 per share last year. The full list of special items that make up the $0.98 per share difference between GAAP and non-GAAP second quarter 2013 results can be found on Page 4 of the consolidated report.","Most significant of these is $0.85 per share related to plant deactivations. Other special items for the second quarter include: trust securities impairment of $0.05 per share, debt redemption cost of $0.04 per share, regulatory charges of $0.02 per share and a decrease of $0.02 per share related to merger accounting for commodity contracts.","Let's turn now to the results from our business units. We'll begin with distribution deliveries, which added $0.02 per share due to a 3% increase in residential deliveries. Overall, distribution sales decreased by 325,000 megawatt hours, or 1% compared to the second quarter of 2012, as the increase in residential sales was more than offset by a 3% decrease in commercial deliveries and a 2% decrease in industrial sales.","Typically, when we speak of the weather impact on residential distribution deliveries, we are looking at heating and cooling degree days. This quarter, the discussion is a bit different because, while second quarter temperatures were warmer than normal, they were significantly cooler than the 2012 period. However, the month of June was more humid in 2013 than in 2012, which contributed to higher residential usage.","In addition, you'll recall that June 2012 sales were negatively impacted by the derecho that swept through parts of our Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia territories on June 29, causing outages for more than 0.5 million customers.","Second quarter industrial sales increased in the chemical and refinery class but declined in the steel and automotive, driven by the bankruptcy of RG Steel and the shutdown of the Ford Brook Park plant. Those events both occurred in May 2012, so we expect some improvement in our year-over-year comparison in the steel and automotive classes starting in the third quarter. Our full year forecast for 2013 calls for an overall increase of 2% in industrial sales, with most of the increase attributable to shale gas activities.","Moving now to other drivers of the second quarter. Reflecting our continued focus on cost control, lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share. On the generation side of our business, O&M benefited from fewer nuclear refueling outages compared to the prior-year period and lower lease costs from the previously repurchased interest in the Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Bruce Mansfield plants.","On the distribution side, expenses were lower due to our greater focus on capital work during the quarter and cost savings initiatives that were implemented last year. Higher general taxes and a higher effective income tax rate decreased earnings by a total of $0.04 per share. And finally, depreciation expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.","I'll turn next to commodity margin for our competitive business. Commodity margin increased earnings by $0.08 per share compared to the second quarter of 2012 when you exclude the $0.11 per share impact of lower PJM capacity revenues. While challenged by low market prices, FES continued to strategically grow its retail business. The total number of retail customers increased by approximately 700,000 in the past 12 months to 2.7 million by the end of the second quarter of 2013. Total megawatt-hour sales in our competitive operations increased 7%, and it increased earnings by $0.04 per share.","Looking now at each of our channels. Governmental aggregation sales increased 31% in the quarter as a result of the continued successful expansion into Illinois. We achieved 35% growth in mass market sales, largely as a result of our successful marketing campaigns in Pennsylvania and Ohio.","Structured sales nearly doubled due to increased municipal, cooperative and bilateral sales. Direct sales to large and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers increased 1%. And finally, consistent with the trend over the past year or so, and our retail strategy, POLR sales continued to decrease as we realigned our portfolio.","Higher second quarter retail sales also had the impact of increasing both our purchase power cost and our transmission expense. However, these expenses were more than offset by lower capacity expenses, higher wholesale sales and the net benefit of financial hedges associated with our sales and generation portfolio. We also saw a lower average cost per fuel, which is, in large part, a result of the work we did late last year to restructure and terminate certain coal contracts, primarily, at Harrison and Sammis. We expect this fuel variance to continue through the end of the year.","Total second quarter ongoing generation output increased modestly by 870,000-megawatt hours as a result of higher capacity factors at our Fossil fleet. Overall, we are pleased with the quarter's solid results, which demonstrate that even in very challenging times, we can strike the right balance of achieving short-term performance, while laying the foundation for what we believe is a strong long-term strategy.","For example, as we mentioned last quarter, we have slowed FirstEnergy Solutions' future hedging based on current market conditions. FES has already exceeded its retail sales targets for 2013, with projected sales of 107 million-megawatt hours at an overall rate in line with the $53 per megawatt hour guidance we provided for the year. Going forward, we remain committed to implementing our plans for our competitive business, but we have adopted an even greater focus on higher-margin sales opportunities and selected customer retention. We continue to believe that our competitive retail strategy is the right approach for the long term, and with continued careful executions, will help ensure we are in a very strong position as market conditions recover.","I'll turn now to an update on our financial plans for the year. As you will recall, in February, we laid out a plan that is structured to improve the balance sheet, particularly at our competitive operations and enhanced liquidity. As Tony said, we have made a significant amount of progress during the first half of the year. I'll walk you through the most recent accomplishments. Tony mentioned that in June, our utilities became the first in the state to successfully take advantage of the new Securitization Act, which allows us to finance deferred cost using AAA-rated long-term securitization financing. This transaction allowed us to redeem $410 million of debt at the Ohio utilities.","In addition to Securitization, we plan to further reduce debt on our 3 Ohio utilities during the third quarter and have the issue notices to redeem an additional $660 million of debt. As these plans are implemented, we will have achieved our goal of significantly improving the credit metrics of each of our Ohio utilities.","As we discussed in the first quarter call, through early May, we had already taken action that resulted in the reduction of about $1.5 billion in long-term debt at our competitive businesses. Subsequently, FE Corp. contributed $1.5 billion of equity to FES, which used the funds to repay outstanding debt. These actions have put the credit metrics for our competitive operations on more solid ground.","During the second quarter, we also completed the extension of our credit facilities through May 2018. And as Tony mentioned, we exercised the $500 million accordion option on our revolver, bringing the total size of the facilities to $6 billion. Overall, we've made very solid progress on the financial plan we laid out for this year, and are reaffirming 2013 non-GAAP earnings guidance.","And looking at the bigger picture, we're working through the challenging economic landscape by taking proactive steps to reduce capital and expenses, without restricting our ability to create and take advantage of opportunities across all of our businesses. As Tony mentioned, we've made significant capital reductions of $875 million on the competitive side of the business, with a continued focus on further refining both our MATS and other capital spend.","We have an intense focus on cost, with $150 million to $200 million in further reductions already identified across the company through medical and benefit changes, staffing reductions and changes to pension funding. We are redeploying capital into regulated areas of our business that provide reliable returns, such as the investments in our transmission business and the potential rate cases and growth opportunities in distribution.","In our retail business, which has a strong book already in place for 2014, we plan to continue to be more selective in our channel and customer activity going forward. Finally, we will continue working to strengthen our balance sheet through our equity program and continued implementation of our financial plan.","As both Tony and I have outlined, we have taken significant steps to reduce costs, redeploy capital toward predictable and reliable return opportunities and move retail megawatt hours into higher-margin channels. The end result will be a stronger FirstEnergy, well positioned to address challenges and deliver positive results for shareholders.","Now I'll open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Listen, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the $150 million to $200 million of savings. And, Tony, I appreciate it's still a bit early in the process, but can you maybe help bucket out what fits into kind of capital savings relative to O&M savings, given all the efforts you guys have done in the last couple of years already to bring cost down and capital out of the business?","Anthony J. Alexander","Dan, this is Tony. When you think about it, it starts off all as an expense reduction. But a big part of our expenses end up being capitalized because it's all people-related. So it's going to really turn out to be a function of whether or not the workload and how it gets allocated -- is just going to be a question of whether or not that $150 million is going to be allocated to expense because that's where the individual would have or is working on, or whether that will be moved over to capital because of that same rationale. This isn't capital in the sense that we're delaying projects or eliminating projects. These are real cash savings that will then get allocated depending on where our people are working and what projects we're working on during the time frame.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So how much headcount reduction goes into this, then? Because that's -- I mean, it's a lot of efficiency gains relative to your cost base.","James F. Pearson","I'd say, Dan, we said that there would be about 250 positions that would be eliminated. Some were not filled, and that was in addition to the 380 positions that were associated with the deactivation of those plants. I think the bigger cost item will be the elimination of some of our benefit cost. It's a bigger cost reduction than just the staffing in itself, Dan. So I would say that would be the more significant component of the cost reduction.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And this doesn't -- this is separate from the money you're saving from Hatfield and Mitchell closing, right?","James F. Pearson","That right, that's right. What I would say the O&M savings associated with Mitchell and Hatfield, that would align with the several-cent incremental earnings per share.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I got it. And then, I'd ask just maybe 1 more question on this, is that if you think about, kind of, from an O&M inflation perspective, net of these benefits, what should we think about, from a '13 baseline, will be the O&M inflation for FirstEnergy on a consolidated basis?","Anthony J. Alexander","I guess, Dan, we're going to wait and give you that next year or later this year when we give you 2014 guidance. Obviously, we'll be looking at all of our costs, not just the ones that we've dealt with here. But fundamentally, each and every time we go about developing what our game plan is for the upcoming year, we'll scrub all of the numbers and determine where best to spend our available cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question, you have in the release a reference to net MISO and PJM transmission costs. What is that? And can you talk about whether transmission rights and underfunding, is that the issue that you are referring to in that, similar to one of your peers earlier this earnings season?","Donald R. Schneider","Brian, this is Donny. Let me talk about the FTRs first because that seems to be a hot issue. Like many of the other PJM market participants, we also have experienced FTR underfunding. However, as we went into this year, we had adjusted our hedging strategy to be less dependent on FTRs. So versus our expectations, the impact has been very minor. If you think about what's going on there, what's driving this underfunding, there is a whole myriad of issues. There's the themes issues between MISO and PJM. There's the difference between what you would anticipate from kind of an infrastructure perspective, when the FTRs are allocated versus what actually occurs with outages and that sort of thing. And then, obviously, differences between how the day-ahead in real-time congestion is settled. I think we also released that we, in fact, filed a complaint with FERC back in 2011 to try and address these issues, and that case is still pending. We are seeing funding coming in, about 75% to 85% of what we feel we're entitled to. So we believe we're being shorted somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% to 25%. So while versus expectations, it's a very minor impact to us, on a year-to-date basis, we believe our revenue was off for about $6.5 million, about $0.01.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And so that's not the MISO, PJM transmission issue, it's a separate issue. Understood.","Donald R. Schneider","That's correct.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, with regards to the cost cuts, just jumping back on Dan's earlier question. Is there a breakdown you can give to what extent those cost cuts are related to deregulated operations versus regulated operations?","James F. Pearson","No. Right now we don't have that breakdown, Brian. And as a Tony said, we're going to incorporate that into our 2014 plans and we'll probably be able to give a little more clarity then.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick question. It seems that there's been a little bit of a change in tact with regard to regulated rate base growth and positioning of the company. Could you, perhaps, confirm that and, perhaps, speak to what a new rate base growth trajectory could be prospectively, given some of the spending ambitions you guys spoke about on the distribution side?","Anthony J. Alexander","Julien, I wouldn't necessarily describe it as difference. I mean, I -- we've always invested heavily in our regulated operations. The fact is, however, that as you look to the future, that there are probably stronger returns available, and more predictable returns available, from shifting investments towards transmission and other items as opposed to investing in generation assets. That's kind of a decision we make all the time in the business. The growth opportunities in transmission and distribution, we're looking very closely at. You've kind of -- I tried to give you a sense for the type of opportunities that are in the transmission business. I wouldn't necessarily say they are the same types of opportunities in the -- one-off opportunities, if you will, in the distribution business, but they are significant in the distribution business if, in fact, we start to, perhaps, accelerate smart meter technology throughout the system. The timing is going to be dependent, in large measure, on when we believe it's time to begin to expand rate base in those areas and take advantage of those growth opportunities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So still not quite clear yet, but stay tuned. Perhaps, looking at the back of the regulated -- unregulated side, rather. The latest RPM auction, while you guys didn't want to disclose how many megawatts cleared kind of indicatively, if you would, in the latest auction relative to the last, how significant was the change in cleared capacity? Do you get what I'm asking? If you can provide anything.","Anthony J. Alexander","Nice try. That's pretty good, though. Since you didn't know the first one or the second one, I don't really know how to answer that. The question was clear, though. You guys are getting better at this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tony, you may have sounded more enthusiastic about the economy than you have in a while. And even though the numbers -- the sort of sales numbers, were not -- we're not seeing it in the numbers, can you just sort of give us some more insight into what you're seeing in the customer base? And what's the basis for your commentary in the prepared remarks?","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes, I think what we're seeing, basically, Jonathan, is -- we think the bottom is behind us now. Most of the plants that we think were particularly exposed, for example, the Ford Brook Park plant we talked about and that 1 steel operation, they were closed in 2012, and we're starting to see that the other items are up significantly. Some of the other steel mills that we have are up. So once you get kind of through this period that we think now is bottomed out, we're seeing some -- we're seeing really strong growth in shale areas, in steel-related, particularly item -- particularly, steel mills that are operating in the pipe-related types of activity. Like I said, housing starts are up. It's a slow start, but it's far more positive than what we've seen in the past. And we're starting to see some activity across each segment of the business. Are you still on? Hello?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I'm sorry, Tony. Hit the mute button. You mentioned the accordion facility at the parent to upside that line $500 million. Does that have cost implications?","James F. Pearson","No. It really doesn't have any cost implications other than you get, always, a charge for your unused capacity. So you have very minor incremental cost associated with it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Not something we're going to notice, then, Jim?","James F. Pearson","Say that again, Jonathan?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Not something we're going to notice?","James F. Pearson","No, you will not notice it. No.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I was wondering, just -- sorry to be a little slow here but Brian, I think, was asking this. What is the PJM, MISO transmission cost? What is causing that? Because it was also a thing that hit you guys had in the first quarter as well?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, I think, Jonathan -- this is Donny. The biggest driver there is just increased sales. I mean, we have to pay network transmission to deliver our product, in many cases. And so that's the biggest driver, but we'll net some other things against that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, the net financial sales and purchase, what was that? The $0.02 there?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, that's basically, when you look at that, we're hedging -- that's one of the instruments we use to hedge the congestion. So we'll do a financial sale and a financial buy to hedge the congestion, and that's the net of the 2.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just in terms of the nuclear expense, with the steam generators and everything, just -- is there any flexibility on that? You did mention that you were thinking of, potentially, augmenting the CapEx going forward. And I was just wondering, given market conditions and everything, whether there's been any change or any thought process on that, if there is any flexibility on that.","James F. Pearson","Those steam generators, you're probably referring to the Davis-Besse that we're planning in '14; and then, we also have Beaver Valley 2 that's in '17. And although you could move that, it's very unlikely that we would because you have a pretty laid out schedule right there that you've got to meet and then you also got to plan what your outages are. So I think it would be very unlikely that we'd be making any modification to that construction schedule.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just finally, with respect to the cost savings and stuff, you mentioned a lot on the benefit side and what have you. And I do see that the retirement benefit sort of noncash -- impact on the cash flow statement has sort of increased. Is that the kind of thing that we should be thinking about? Should we be thinking about this as being one of those things that over the long term provides savings but in the near term, that sort of accelerated in terms of the noncash accounting benefit because of the OPEB and the pension liability are lower?","Anthony J. Alexander","No, I think the ones that we're talking about today, while there could be some impacts there, the ones we're talking about today are fundamental changes in plans. Single administrator, as an example. Changing in plans that have higher deductibles. Things of that nature are driving the real change and the cost savings.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So it will have a direct cash impact pretty quickly, it would sound like, starting in 2014?","Anthony J. Alexander","That's what we're expecting, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","A couple of questions. Just on the equity issuance through the DRIP programs, is that just a 2013 -- or do you intend to continue new equity through DRIP after '13?","James F. Pearson","At this point, we would expect that this would continue throughout next year. And as we said, it would be about $100 million on an annual basis, Steve. So you won't see $100 million this year. It probably won't really get implemented until probably by the fourth quarter of next year. But we would expect that to continue into next year.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So from a model standpoint, like, just assume $100 million per year, really, starting in '14?","James F. Pearson","That's correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then on retail margins, it sounded like, if I heard it, you said that maybe you're actually seeing improving retail margins. Because it seems like most other people keep complaining that retail margins are declining. So maybe you could just give some color. Just clarify kind of what you are seeing on retail margins? And maybe, is it that you're targeting this different customer base or why do you think it might be very different than what we're hearing from others?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, Steve, this is Donny. I think it is the way we're pushing into the different channels. I think over the last several years, we have talked about our multichannel approach. And some of those channels are harder. I mean, retail sales, residential retail sales is much harder than selling to a big C&I customer. Generally, you get stronger margins there. You have to be very careful about your cost to acquisition. But if you think about, for example, our $0.07 for 7 years, in today's market, those contracts are paying very nice margins to us. In general, I think right now we've sold about 75 terawatt hours forward for 2014, and we're seeing an aggregate rate, about $1 better than what we're delivering this year. I think this year we're right about that $53 a megawatt hour. Next year, what we've got booked so far, will produce something right around $54 a megawatt hour.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then, my last question is just on the -- you mentioned the Hatfield shutdown and Mitchell that's about a 10% reduction in megawatt hours, but obviously, a lot of cash flow benefit from that. The Other savings at generation in terms of cash flow, I mean, is there any additional impact on megawatt hour production? Or should we assume about that 10% reduction just from those plants?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, I would assume it's probably about 9.5 to 10 million-megawatt hours that would be associated with the Hatfield and Mitchell. So that's what I would assume for that.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","But the other cash flow savings that you mentioned don't have any associated reduction in megawatt hours?","Donald R. Schneider","No, no, no. That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just talk about the credit position and the equity needs. Regarding Harrison and the asset transfer, if that were to not be approved, how would that impact your thinking about equity requirements?","Donald R. Schneider","I don't think that it would change our thought process on equity at all.","Anthony J. Alexander","We've laid out our game plan for equity. Those will not affect our decision-making.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So a -- the period to get that transfer of Harrison would not -- wouldn't impact that, okay.","Anthony J. Alexander","No.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, just switching over to transmission, you had mentioned a lot of potential growth. As you think about the financing and structuring of that, do you think much about different options in terms of how to finance that? Some folks have thought about a pure-play transmission approach or is this something we should just assume would very likely just continue to be funded sort of organically within FirstEnergy?","Anthony J. Alexander","My sense is that we will look at a number of different opportunities and determine what's in our best interest and our shareholders' best interest going forward.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that is something that you are -- you do think about a variety of options there? It's not set in stone that it will always be simply funded within FirstEnergy?","Anthony J. Alexander","I think that's a fair statement, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Tony, I just wanted to recap what I heard, so I apologize if I might be repeating some things. One thing you said is that the generation transaction would be at least a couple of pennies or more accretive to EPS starting next year, 2014. I think -- so the other thing that came out is that there's $875 million of reduction in CapEx over this time horizon of MATS. And if I can get what that is -- over what period, is it 3 years? 5 years? I forget what the time frame of that is. Thirdly, you mentioned about $150 million to $200 million of lower cost reductions. These are additional stuff. And if I'm right, you mentioned that a lot of them would be related to retirement benefits. And if I'm hearing that's lower deductible and everything. If I'm right, those would mean lower, I guess, pension or retirement costs, if I understand rightly, what was described in the Q&A. If I can get a little bit of a clarifications on what I said, if they are on the right track or not on the right track?","Anthony J. Alexander","Okay. Well, let me deal with the first one, since I only said it's accretive. I think Jimmy said it's, what, a couple of cents?","James F. Pearson","Yes.","Anthony J. Alexander","So I think the couple of cents is kind of what you ought to be thinking about. The $875 million reduction in capital, I think that's -- was that 5 years? Over that 5-year time frame. With the bulk of that coming in the earlier years, the time when the MATS expenditures would be coming through. And with respect to the $150 million to $200 million, I think you're a little confused. The bulk of these expenditure or bulk of these savings relate to current employees. Somebody raised a question with respect to retirees, but the fact of the matter is, the medical plan benefit changes and the other change that we are contemplating in benefits and otherwise, are really related to the current benefit package we offer employees.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Fair enough. And then, if I heard, we might get 2014 outlook this year at EEI or is that what we should look forward to?","Anthony J. Alexander","We'll give it to you when we're ready.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have 2 quick questions. One is the $54 per megawatt hour margin for the retail business for 2014. Is that really comparable to the margins from this year, given that there's a change in mix? For instance, between retail and C&I sales?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes. I think it's very comparable. I mean, if you think about what the markets have done as we booked those sales, the wholesale markets have dropped off fairly steadily over the last several years. And to be able to deliver a higher aggregate rate, I think is significant.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","No, I'm actually more asking about, if there is, like, a significantly higher SG&A expense associated with those sales compared to the sales that are being executed this year?","Donald R. Schneider","No. No, generally, I think, Angie, what you'd see is our SG&A expenses have come down. I would especially point to fuel, for example, has come down significantly based on the work we did last year.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And secondly, I know that you're still in the midst of the hydro asset sales process. But can you at least give us a sense of, at this stage, your expectations for the outcome of that sale as similar to expectations that you had earlier in the year?","James F. Pearson","Yes, I think, at this point, Angie, we had the first round of indicative bids. We had a lot of interest in the hydro assets. We're in the process now of narrowing that down, and we're continuing to evaluate that. So I don't think there is any change at this point.","Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for participating in the call and your continued interest in FirstEnergy. Thanks.","Anthony J. Alexander","Bye now.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Donna, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016 and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.78 per share. While Jim will review our financial results in more detail, I want to quickly mention that we produced quality results and met our operating earnings guidance, despite the impact of an unseasonably mild winter and low power prices.","The successful implementation of our economic dispatch strategy was key to that outcome because the fuel savings that resulted from idling some units when market prices did not support them, helped to offset the other impacts of mild temperatures across the company, particularly in our Distribution business. In addition to meeting our financial commitments to you, we continue to implement our regulated growth strategies. We have several positive developments on that front, and we will provide more detail today on our next steps to ensure continued service reliability for our customers with appropriate recovery of our investments.","Let's start in Ohio, where the Public Utilities Commission completed a comprehensive nearly two-year review of our Powering Ohio's Progress Electric Security Plan and unanimously approved the plan with certain modifications. The PUCO concluded that the approved plan promotes rate stability and retail competition and adds value for Ohio customers, communities and the environment. I would both like to compliment and thank our Public Utilities Commissioners and staff for their leadership and handling a very complex regulatory matter. I am proud of this ESP and of the entire team that worked on it.","The plan helped to safeguard customers against rising energy prices in future years while preserving key power plants that serve Ohio customers ensuring fuel diversity and maintaining Ohio jobs. In addition, it outlined steps to support low income customers, reinstate energy efficiency programs, evaluate smart grid technologies, and includes a goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It truly fulfills the principles that the Ohio legislature outlined for the Electric Security Plans when they moved the state toward retail competition. Currently, it's been a long and conscientious process to get to this point and while PUCO approval is a critical milestone, there are still challenges at FERC.","Our opponents have also expressed their intent to bring court challenges. I will quickly review our position on these issues and Leila can address your additional questions during the Q&A.","First, we believe FERC should affirm the waiver that is already in place. You'll recall that FES was granted authorization from FERC to conduct certain transactions with our Ohio utilities in 2008.","Our Purchase Power Agreement is one of those transactions. It was carefully constructed from the beginning to comply with existing FERC rules that promote customer shopping for retail energy supply and it will not hinder the PJM markets ability to function and foster competition.","A separate complaint asked FERC to impose a price for on the PPA units for the May 2016 PJM, RPM capacity auction. We don't believe there's any reason for our PPA units to be treated differently than any of the other regulated generation in PJM.","It's no secret that a significant amount of generation, both regulated and merchant has been offered into prior PJM options with price taking behavior. Some of these complaints are likely in that group of suppliers.","What they are asking FERC to do is essentially have FirstEnergy protect them from themselves. We have filed a strong answer demonstrating that a price floor is not needed and challenging the economic theory behind the opposition's price floor methodology. And we do not expect that FERC will impose a price floor on the PPA units for the upcoming auction.","With regards to the other potential challenges, we believe that the PUCOs decision is well within the Commission's authority and we expect it will withstand subsequent challenges.","Furthermore, the notion of non-bypassable charges on Ohio utility bills is not new, as charges for programs such as energy efficiency, economic development and low income support, as well as cost to support the bulk Transmission System have been in place for years.","Given that FERC could make an announcement on the issues before them very soon, we are holding off on providing a second quarter operating earnings guidance. Once we do have additional clarity from FERC, we expect to have a better picture of our full-year 2016 outlook, and we will offer you further details and guidance.","I know this decision may seem inconsistent with our stated objective to improve transparency and disclosures. We remain committed to giving you the information you need to evaluate our company when we know it. DSP is simply too significant to speculate on its outcome.","While we do anticipate filing for a rehearing on the ESP IV by May 2, to address a few items of clarification, we're moving forward to implement the PPA that was entered into on April 1.","As you know, our Regulated Generation Group has experienced selling the output for Mon Powers regulated units at Fort Martin and Harrison into PJM. They're using that experience and have retained a leading industry consultant to help prepare strategies and offer formation for the Davis-Besse and Sammis Plants in advance of the May, PJM capacity auction. The regulated team plans to sell the output from Davis-Besse and Sammis into PJM as of June 1. We're also laying the groundwork to meet the provisions outlined in the terms of the ESP IV.","In late February, we submitted our grid modernization business plan, which outlined the menu of options for the PUCO. We also filed our Energy Efficiency Plan with the Commission earlier this month and by November 1, we will file a carbon reduction report that outlines our fuel diversification and carbon reduction strategies.","In the ESP, we proposed a CO2 reduction goal of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, building on the 25% reduction in CO2 emissions already achieved across our footprint. This goal represents a potential reduction of more than 80 million tons of CO2 emissions and is among the most aggressive targets in the utility industry.","In support of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we launched a branding campaign in February called The Switch is On. This campaign highlights our environmental achievements, transition to a cleaner energy sources, and our Green electricity options.","Earlier this month, we entered into a unique Green energy pact with the Cleveland Indians to provide Progressive Field with 100% Green-e certified wind energy from FirstEnergy Solutions. We also introduced an Earth Day promotion inviting Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to sign up for 100% wind energy at the same price as the standard energy offer.","Turning to other regulatory matters, our proposed Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary known as MAIT, received FERC approval in late February. As we have discussed, this subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L, and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for these customers.","Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania ALJs issued an initial decision approving a settlement filed by the parties resolving all issues in this case. We anticipate final approval from the Pennsylvania PUC by mid-year.","And last week, we made a supplemental filing in New Jersey seeking to transfer certain JCP&L distribution assets into MAIT, which we believe should satisfy the concerns regarding public utility status that were addressed by the BPU in February. We will continue to work with the BPU because we believe transferring these assets to MAIT is the right thing to do for our New Jersey customers.","As we mentioned in February, we have passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment program with $2.4 billion invested through 2015 on projects designed to make our system more robust, secure, and resistant to extreme weather events.","This program remains on track, and we continue to view the Transmission business as our primary growth platform for many years to come. Over the past two years, we have been focused on removing regulatory uncertainty and positioning our regulated businesses for growth.","Tomorrow, we plan to file rate cases for JCP&L and our four Pennsylvania utilities that are consistent with our goals of enhancing customer service and reliability, strengthening the distribution system, improving security, and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to our infrastructure, while providing stability and growth for the company.","In Pennsylvania, our four utilities will file rate plans with the Public Utilities Commission aimed at extending the service reliability improvement efforts that have yielded significant results for more than 2 million customers. Since 2011, the number of power outage impacting our Pennsylvania customers has decreased by an average of about 27%, while restoration times have improved by an average of about 14% in that same period.","In total, our request would result in an expected revenue increase totaling $430 million across four Pennsylvania utilities, and we've broken down the impact by operating company in the Appendix of our slide presentation.","These changes would bring the average monthly bills in line with the typical residential bills for the other three major electric utilities in the state, while benefiting customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increased vegetation management activities and continuing customer service enhancements. Pending PUC approval, we anticipate that the new rates will take effect in January of 2017.","The new base rates at the Pennsylvania utilities would also include recovery of costs associated with our long term infrastructure improvement plans, which include a projected increase in capital investments of $245 million over five years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. We expect to begin recovering the cost of those programs in July through the distribution system improvement charges that are currently pending Pennsylvania PUC approval.","We also plan to file a rate plan with the New Jersey BPU that supports and builds on the significant service reliability improvements made by JCP&L in recent years. The planned $142-million rate request seeks to improve service and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, vegetation management and inspections of lines, poles and substations, while also compensating for other business and operating expenses.","The JCP&L plan is designed to extend the service reliability improvements and helped the utility achieve its best service reliability record in more than a decade last year. While JCP&L's rates have remained stable and even declined over the past decade, our operating expenses have continued to increase.","Since July 2012, JCP&L has invested $612 million in service-related enhancement projects. And even with the proposed 6% overall rate increase for the average residential customer, JCP&L would continue to offer the lowest residential electric rates among the four regulated electric distribution companies in New Jersey.","You will remember that our last rate case in New Jersey, which was based on a 2011 test year, was complicated due to storm recovery expense issues and other items. In the upcoming proceeding, which satisfies the BPU requirement that we file a new rate case by April of 2017, we hope for a reasonable timeline in recognition of the significant investments we have made. Allowing for a thorough review of our filing, we will request the new rates to go into effect in January of 2017.","We remain focused on continuing to position our company for growth and success to best serve our customers, communities, investors and employees. Now, I would turn the call over to Jim for his review of the quarter. And as always, we will have plenty of time for your questions at the end of his remarks.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.","I'm sure you have also noticed that we did not publish a full FactBook this quarter. We hope to have greater clarity to regarding the PPA shortly, which would hopefully allow us to have an analyst meeting and provide full guidance for 2016. In place of the FactBook, we have included an Appendix to the slides for today's call with certain regulatory and financial updates we would normally publish each quarter.","Our first-quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share compares to $0.62 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, we recorded earnings of $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2016, compared to $0.53 per basic share during the same period last year. 2016 first quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $0.02 per share, which includes regulatory charges primarily related to economic development and energy efficiency programs associated with the Ohio ESP commitments, offset by mark-to-market gains on commodity contracts.","A full listing of the special items can be found on page two of the consolidated report. In our Distribution business, results were impacted primarily by mild temperatures on distribution deliveries and lower rates in New Jersey that went into effect in 2015, partially offset by the benefit of Pennsylvania rates that were also implemented last year.","Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2015 with a 13.4% decrease in residential sales and a 5.1% decrease in commercial sales, reflecting heating degree days that were 25% below last year and 11% below normal. On a weather adjusted basis, residential deliveries were essentially flat while commercial deliveries decreased 1.6%.","Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.8%. We do continue to see growth in shale gas sector but the rate has slowed dramatically in the past two years and is not enough to offset lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. First-quarter Industrial load was off nearly 110 gigawatt hours as a result of reduced operations at Republic Steel, which then announced an indefinite shutdown on April 1 and a permanent closure of Warren Steel.","Overall, our sales are following the national trend that was noted by the Energy Information Association earlier this year. Whether-adjusted residential and commercial sales are each down more than 1% over the past four quarters while industrial load is down 3% in that timeframe. Drivers include the impact of more efficient lighting, appliances and equipment and slowing and shifting economic growth.","In our Transmission business, operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base at ATSI, partially offset by the lower return on equity that was part of ATSI's comprehensive settlement approved by FERC last fall. In our Competitive business, strong first quarter earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, as well as lower purchased power expense, higher wholesale sales and lower fossil fuel expense. These factors offset lower contract sales volume, which decreased in line with our hedging strategy. The decrease in fossil fuel expense relates to lower fuel rigs, and as Chuck indicated earlier, it also reflects the benefits for our economic dispatch strategy, which kept the Bruce Mansfield Plant offline for part of February and March. This strategy is the right approach at this time and we will continue to deploy it if markets don't support plant operations.","Clearly, this remains a very challenging business environment for our competitive units as prices continue to drop. Although we're not updating our CES adjusted EBITDA guidance at this time. We know that a reduction of about $3 per megawatt-hour in the round-the-clock prices since the beginning of this year translates into a reduction of more than $50 million in wholesale revenue.","Our committed sales are about 62 million megawatt-hours for 2016 with an additional 12 million megawatt-hours as part of the Ohio PPA. In 2017, we have 42 million megawatt-hours committed with an additional 20 million megawatt-hours for the Ohio PPA.","We are reaffirming our expectations that the Competitive business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018.","And finally, in Corporate, a higher consolidated income tax rate and other expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2015.","As Chuck said, we're off to a very solid start in 2016, and we're encouraged by the developments in Ohio and remain committed to providing customer-focused growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders.","Now, I'd like to open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning guys.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could you give us a sense of what the drivers for the rate increase \u2013 the rate request in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are? I hear the comment that your rates are going to be \u2013 and it'll bring rates up to the average. But just what the big drivers are? And then maybe a sense of where the ROEs are tracking in the \u2013 to its various jurisdictions as you make these filings?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Jonathan, this is Jim. Let me take a shot at it and then I'll let Leila get into more detail if we need. First off, we're going to have an increase in our rate base. So, that will be part of it. We also have increased depreciation expense associated with our investments. We're also rolling in the DISC rider as part of this increase. We have smart meters and also there has been a decrease in sales, so that's going to be part of the driver there.","So, those are primarily the major drivers. As I would say that there was not a defined ROE last year in the Pennsylvania case. So, it's hard to say if we're tracking to that. But, overall, I'd say our earnings in Pennsylvania are doing well, but because of these significant investments as well as the decrease in sales and the DISC rider, that is leading to the increase. And Leila, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Just one further point of clarification with respect to the \u2013 on the depreciation comment, and we're actually proposing a changed methodology in depreciation that's just driving some of that change.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is that just in Pennsylvania or in both?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Correct. Correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Is that a meaningful piece of it or just one of many?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","With regard to depreciation, it's roughly $31 million of the change.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. So it sounds like, in general, this is not about returns. It's more about investments and the other things you listed.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That's correct, Jonathan. Okay.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Jonathan I have said all along that as we continue to move this company more towards a regulated model and we prepare for growth in our T&D operations, you're going to see more and more rate increases or rate cases in order to accommodate that growth.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So fair enough. I think I had a 6% number mentioned for New Jersey. Did you provide a percentage on the Pennsylvania jurisdictions?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It's \u2013 I think that's included in the Appendix Jonathan and when we break down all four of the Pennsylvania companies you have that rate increase.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, we'll see that, and thank you. And then one final thing, you commented that you're going to wait until you have clarity from FERC on giving Q2 guidance. But more broadly if, let's say, FERC doesn't act ahead of the upcoming auction and maybe there's a longer delay there, how should we think about this in the context of when you might have an Analyst Day and a broader update to the outlook?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think that our game plan is to wait and see what FERC does. If it drags on too long, then my expectation is we'll give you a guidance for 2016 without the ESP baked into it. That would be our plan. I don't expect that this is going to drag on a long time.","There's a lot of speculation out there that they'll make a decision before the May RPM. That doesn't bother me so much if they don't because a lot of the opponent's cases suggesting that we're going to do something inappropriate in how we bid these units.","And once they see how we bid these units, then I think that would diffuse a lot of that argument. So if it waits until after the RPM, that wouldn't bother me too much. But beyond that, I think if it continues to go on and we are going to give you guidance for 2016 without the ESP.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So we should probably anticipate by early summer, you'll be doing that then in any event?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Paul.","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a sort of follow-up on Jonathan's question and your answer, should we \u2013 it seems to suggest that perhaps your bidding behavior would be the same with or without the PPA. Is that an accurate or that there wouldn't be that big of a difference, how should we think about that?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're not going to talk about our bidding behavior. But I think it is something that FERC can look at. If they just look at how we bid our West Virginia plants in the last RFP or actually in \u2013 since capacity performance, they could see a very good indication of how we bid units on the regulated side. We haven't disclosed that bidding behavior and we don't plan to.","But my point is this. I don't think that \u2013 I think there's a lot of rhetoric going on about how these PPAs might affect the capacity market. It's nothing, but rhetoric. This PPA has no impact on the PJM market whatsoever.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, in terms of your expectation that they will probably take action before the auction, which is coming right up, is that with respect to all three cases or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 to the both cases for you, or one in particular?","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Hi, Paul, this is Leila. Given the high profile, I guess my view on this would be that they would be looking at both these cases before the Base Residual Auction.","Just to give clarity, from the way I view the world, if you think about the affiliate waiver case, if I'm the chairman, he looks at things from a legalistic standpoint. I kind of view things that same way. And so I have a case in front of me where there's strong precedence not to look behind the screen if you were to what the states are doing. He has \u2013 in the initial 2008 waiver, there was a claim by Nopak that non-bypassable charges should be looked at and should cause him to say that there're not \u2013 not all the customers \u2013 that there are captive customers. They chose not to make that finding. So to go against this and grant the complaint, he would have to go against legal precedent.","I don't see him doing that and I think he would want to get that out of the way and that's tied to Mon Power complaint because fundamentally they're kind of looking to address, call it the same issue. And if you look at the Mon Power complaint, there are a lot of parties with \u2013 that wait in with a lot of different potential remedies. And I don't think they're going to fall prey to the hyperbole, especially out there by Dynegy that there is a burning platform that there is imminent danger. If they're going to want to act and give clarity and take their time and look at this.","So from my standpoint, I think they're going to want to act on the waiver, I think they are going to deny the complaint because I think it's \u2013 to do otherwise would be inconsistent with past precedent. They can take care of the issues supposedly involved in that complaint, in the Mon Power complaint, but they can do so in a very thoughtful way by addressing it through the stakeholder process what they are used to dealing with it and taking care of it in the next \u2013 for the next BRA auction in 2017.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","I just wanted to give clarity to the market in that regard.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That makes sense. And then just finally, I apologize if I missed this. The $0.09 charge \u2013 regarding the regulatory charge, what was that associated with?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","The regulatory charge, that was primarily the commitment we made under the ESP, and that's associated with some energy efficiency commitments, as well as some low income and some economic development.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And it's a one-timer?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It's a one-timer. Since we committed to make those payments, so we're required to recognize that at the time of the commitment. It is a liability to us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Thanks so much. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Could we just write-off just a couple of policy questions, here? Can we touch on what we're hearing a little bit on Chairman Porter's potential resignation? The timing is a little bit suspect and it's a crucial period. Could we get some clarity there?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I will give you my comments. I think that Chairman Porter showed outstanding leadership during the time he was at the Commission. You know, he got a very important docket moved forward. Hate to see him go, but as you know how it goes. When job opportunities present themselves, you don't get to pick the timing of them. So he called me the other day and we had a good conversation, and I don't think you should read anything into it other than what was said.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe a question directed to Leila. So the Supreme Court ruling in Maryland obviously net-net most saw it as a negative, but obviously some of the Justices gave some guidance around what would be from a legal standpoint possible. They clearly drew some distinctions between Maryland and New Jersey versus what you're proposing in Ohio. So I'd like to get maybe your opinion here on what you thought of the Supreme Court ruling.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","So net-net, I actually think it's quite positive. So you may recall the Maryland case was out there when we first constructed the PPA. So we knew we were kind of threading the needle with regard to that, and I think that the Supreme Court's decision confirms that we did a good job of that. The decision in and of itself does not negatively impact it. In fact, if you look at one of the footnotes, they go into a long detailed description of the traditional bilateral contract, which mirrors directly our PPA.","So from a structure standpoint, if you think about it, through that footnote, they signaled that the structure of the PPA is something that is out there in the market and that they feel comfortable with. So structurally, I think it meets the test.","And then if you go back to the EPSA case, albeit (33:57) they made a statement that insulating retail customers from price fluctuations is something that fell under state authority. So if what the Commission's purpose was was appropriate per EPSA and the structure is appropriate per the Hughes decision, I think again those two together present us a very strong case with regard to any Federal District Court case that might be brought our way.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. So it's just fair to say that if something if you get a negative outcome at FERC and this does gets taken up by the Supreme Court, it's a pretty good standing.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","I think it's an excellent standing. Thank you.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Okay good. And just one last question, Chuck, on, sort of, having had an update on the equity. But if FERC decides to take up this case, and this, sort of, gets drawn out a little bit, how should we, sort of, think about your equity needs?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think you should think about it the way I have been answering it for the last year-and-a-half. And that is we can't make a determination until we have all of these answers, and I don't expect that it's going to be a lengthy FERC process. So \u2013 and my position from the beginning has been \u2013 it's our obligation to structure this company and operate it in a way where we could get our credit issues behind us without having to use equity to do that.","We're talking to you about a lot of growth opportunities on the regulated distribution and transmission side. Assuming we get successfully done with MAIT, that opens up more transmission investment. And I'm not going to be embarrassed to tell you we want to use equity to help grow this company going forward. But the amount and the timing \u2013 I'm not ready to discuss.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Please proceed with your question.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I had a general question on the distribution strategy going forward. With lower sales growth, is the strategy to continue to file regular rate cases to compensate you for the increased spend or, in some jurisdictions are you looking to implement some sort of formula rate plans like you are with the DISC mechanism in Pennsylvania?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would answer that we have five different distribution strategies. We serve in five states. They all have different regulatory treatments. Under the Ohio ESP, we have an extension of the DCR through the term. We also have a new treatment for smart grid and smart meter type investments. So there is a different regulatory strategy in Ohio than in Pennsylvania.","In Pennsylvania, we've got the LTIP and the DISC. And, obviously, we're filing for rate cases there and in New Jersey. In West Virginia, we had a case last year where, if we get to a position where we need another case, we'll file it. And in Maryland, quite frankly, the growth in load has been commensurate with our investments. And there has been no need to file a case there.","So I think it's five different strategies. Overall, though, I would tell you the strategy is to start making the investments needed to improve the service to our customers beyond where we're at, to provide more security to the distribution network, and, basically, make investments to serve our customers better, and then do them in a way where we can communicate to you how we're going to get the returns.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then my second question was on the competitive generation side and the sensitivity to the open position. Can you remind us roughly how many terawatt hours or what percentage of your expected generation that you plan to keep open in any given year?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Yeah. This is Donny, Neel. Without the PPA, we have \u2013 our FactBook would show we have about 17 terawatt-hours open for 2016. I think Jim talked about the fact that a $3 move on that 17 terawatt-hours would be about a $50-million impact. With the PPA, if the PPA goes forward, we actually chew up some of that open position, as we look through the end of 2016.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just last point of clarification on Pennsylvania. You say you're going to implement the DISC structure with this rate case. Would that help basically lengthen out the period between rate cases? Or is that just for a small portion of the distribution spend going forward?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually the DISC \u2013 we have filed for the DISC effective July 1 to start treating the first investments in our Long Term Infrastructure Plan. And under this rate case, any DISC expenditures after that point would be rolled into the base rates, and then we have the option going forward to then use the DISC in real-time to recover investments in the Long Term Infrastructure Plan in the outyears. So, we file to invest $245 million over the next five years. So, we're going to use both.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning.","Charles E.

Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. Brian how are you doing?","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Very good. Very good. I just wanted to follow-up on the early equity issuance question just in a little bit more specific way. Can you provide your latest thoughts on timing or amount with regards to equity issuance just for Transmission purposes?","And particularly if FERC is going to be delaying its response to the PPA question, does it make sense to potentially separate your equity issuance for transmission and not make that contingent on timing for FERC?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, so I've talked about in my comments the fact that we're halfway through energizing the future; we've invested $2.4 billion in our Transmission over the last two years with no equity. And during a time that we were working to kind of strengthen our cash flows in order to improve our credit metrics. We've got two more years of that program at about $1 billion a year. I don't see any equity needed to fund that Transmission growth.","Going forward, if we plan to expand our Transmission investment program or expand significantly what we're doing in the distribution, then any equity needs would be associated with increased investment in T&D.","So, I answered the same way we're not prepared to say what that amount is, but I don't think you need to be worried about energizing the future being taken off-track in any case.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Very good. Thanks. That's all I've got.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Julien.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, following up perhaps where we started on the rate cases, can you remind us where we stand on earned ROEs in kind of a trailing basis for 2015? Just I suppose speaking to the rate case filing itself for whatever you have out there, both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.","And perhaps on a prospective basis, the purpose for the case, at least New Jersey, seems to be recovering O&M, and then separately Pennsylvania seems principally driven by the implementation of the DISC and spending investments there, is that kind of good (42:21) them respectively?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Julien, this is Jim. I would say that in Pennsylvania, it's primarily driven by somewhat the decrease in the load. It's part of the DISC filing that we have. There's also additional investments that we've made there. We've got a very large smart meter implementation program going on over there. So that's primarily what's driving that in Pennsylvania. You're also able to file on the forward-looking test year.","When I look at New Jersey, it's primarily driven by a significant amount of investment that we've made since the last test year in New Jersey, and that was 2011. And as we said in our remarks since July of 2012, we've had a significant amount of capital investment.","And why we say partway through 2012, because in the test year New Jersey you're allowed to claim in-service amounts for six months after the in-service date. So we've had a significant amount of investment in New Jersey, so that's what's driving that.","Again, as far as our overall return on equity within each of the states, I would say that we're probably tracking right around where we should, based on the last rate proceedings. However, as you know, in Pennsylvania, they did not publish what the ROE was in the settlement.","Leila L. Vespoli - Executive Vice President, Markets & Chief Legal Officer","Julien, this is Leila. The only thing that I would add when you're thinking about Pennsylvania, think about aggressive energy efficiency measures and no lost distribution recovery. So when Jim was talking about the lower revenue, those factors play into that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then, turning to the equity piece of the equation, just to be clear on setting expectations, we shouldn't expect to hear from you on equity until you get a definitive decision to either reject or accept the waiver \u2013 well, not the waiver, but the decision outright from FERC, and no action from the credit rating agencies correspondingly until that's well (44:46).","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct. I would say, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is actually Kevin. Other than the PPA, are there any other uncertainties or hurdles that would prevent you from giving guidance in the early summer?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And if the FERC was to uphold the contracts, but it ended up going to the Ohio Supreme Court, would you still plan to implement the contracts on June 1, or would it then be delayed?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We plan to implement them on June 1.","Kevin Prior - Evercore Group LLC","No matter what challenges there. Okay. That's all I have. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about the supply side of the business. And ex the PPA, if you just look at the performance over the past couple of quarters, I think specifically, excluding the change in capacity prices and excluding the change in the volume. You've had a pretty noticeable improvement there, despite decline in commodity prices. Maybe you could just flush that out a little bit more and give us a color there.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll start and then I'll let Donny add to it. During 2015, we talked with you about our cash flow improvement program. Much of that was focused on the Competitive business. And much of that was focused on getting our Competitive business to the point where it continues to be cash flow positive and it has no need for any cash from the parent through 2018 at current energy prices as we know them.","So part of that was also targeted at the FFO from the Generation business. So we reduced O&M expenditures, which contributed to some of what you're seeing there. So that's kind of from an operational perspective, the thing that Jim Lash and his Generation team have done to improve the competitiveness of that business. I will let Donny talk a little bit about the Commodity side.","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Yes, I'd just add, obviously we have taken a position starting after the polar vortex in 2014 to derisk the business and to move away from weather sensitive load. You'll recall in the first quarter of 2015 we had what's been referred to as the Siberian Express and while it was not nearly as significant of an impact to FES as the polar vortex, it's still have some impact. I'm happy to report this past quarter, although we had very mild weather, the fact that we have much less weather sensitive load, are results were pretty much in line with our expectations from a sales perspective.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Donny and his team are doing a fantastic job running the business too. Back in February when we had Mansfield off for two weeks, the entire plant off, there were several seller side notes that suggested that, meant that load was down and we're going to have a bad quarter. In reality, that's part of how we're dispatching is those units differently. So we don't run them when we can't make money with them. So I talked in my remarks about that save this fuel. So Donny is doing a great job at looking at every day, every hour, how do we maximize that business under some very difficult economic times.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I mean, to that point is there anything that we should think about historically that's forced you to run units that were uneconomic, such as mandatory take-or-pay coal contracts or something of that nature that would be rolling off this year or in the future, to kind of provided a tailwind for your numbers all else equal or I might barking up the wrong tree there?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead Donny.","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Yeah. I mean, we've had coal contracts in place for a lot of years. It gives us significant flexibility. This isn't really something new for us. I think the degree is much greater now, but you'll recall back in \u2013 I believe it was 2012 \u2013 around August 2012, we took the entire Sammis Plant down and kept it offline through December. So it's not really new. I think the difference is with the weak \u2013 incredibly weak forward day ahead market that we are seeing, it calls in more economic dispatch than perhaps what we had seen in the past.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then shifting gears to transmission again, the rejection by New Jersey of your utility status for that MAIT request would seem on the surface to be a significant setback. But your comments have indicated that you're going to continue to push forward, and you think it's very important. Could you maybe characterize how important the New Jersey part of MAIT program is to the overall transmission spend kind of levels going forward and growth going forward, and the timing now that you have had this setback, if it's been adjusted at all in New Jersey (50:18)?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, first I would say, I think MAIT is very important to our customers in New Jersey. And we have to do a better job of helping the BPU understand why it is important. We've done that in our latest filing and will continue to work with them to get it across the finish line. If we don't, then we'll look at options to implement MAIT in Pennsylvania potentially.","But as far as your real question in terms of how does it affect or transmission investment strategy, we've got two more years of energizing the future. We've got projects beyond that inside ATSI and TrAILCo that we can continue to move forward with.","I don't see MAIT been crucial at all to our transmission investment strategy. I see it as a way to implement that transmission investment strategy in a way where we can lower the cost of capital and do it in a way that's better for customers and create more transparency for our investors. That's how I see it.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to focus on the Pennsylvania revenue request. When I look at the Appendix, it looks like the customer bill impacts can be relatively significant. I think one of the jurisdictions, it's about 18%, if I'm reading the page correctly. Is there a way to phase that out in order to otherwise lessen the overall bill impact, and are there other precedents we can look to in Pennsylvania in terms of just how to think about that, that it looks like a fairly sizeable rate impact?","James F. Pearson - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Stephen, this is Jim. I would say that, as we said earlier in our comments and Chuck said, it is that this will bring the average residential bill in Pennsylvania up to \u2013 about what's average within the state. You'll recall we went a number of years without increasing our rates in the State of Pennsylvania. It's also being offset by a \u2013 from a customer perspective, it's being offset by a reduction in their overall energy component of the bill.","So, I don't view this as something it's going to be what would be described as a rate shock issue. As far as your earlier request, no I don't \u2013 we don't see any mechanism out there where we would phase this in. This is just a normal type of request that we would have. And again as Leila pointed out earlier, there is very stringent energy efficiency requirements in the State of Pennsylvania, which is decreasing the usage. So we're required to go in and file for these rates. So that's the way we're looking at it.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And in terms of the magnitude of the benefit from lower energy costs, is there a way for us to get a sense for the magnitude of that benefit?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think you could probably look at where wholesale power prices have gone over the last few years. And as Donny mentioned, wholesale power prices have fallen $3.00 already this year.","So I think there was a period of time when around-the-clock power prices were in the $50-plus range, and if you look at the forwards out there right now, over the next three years, they're probably closer to the $30 range.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashar Khan of Visium.

One thing I was just wanted to help in terms of trying to measure these rate cases in terms of earnings potential. Is there some way you could give us what the increase in kind of rate base would be from kind of like what you have in your numbers this year versus \u2013 because it's a forward test year next year, could you signify the increase in rate base for the two jurisdictions?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I will answer it at a high level, and if you want details, then I'll let Leila and Jim fill in. But as filed, in effect January of next year, the JCP&L case is about $0.20 a share and the Pennsylvania cases combined are about $0.40 a share.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay.

So when I look at the plans covered by the PPA, say, in 2016, can you tell us if the assets the plans have a positive EPS contribution without the PPA?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Angie, this is Donny. Let me make sure I understand your question. So you're asking if Sammis and Davis-Besse have a positive earnings contribution without the PPA?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. So basically, when you showed us the EBITDA and then a bridge to net income or EPS, for SES \u2013 or CES without the PPAs, can you tell us the assets of those three plans or two plans that are covered by PPAs, so without the PPA would they have a positive EPS impact?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","Yes. For 2016, Sammis and Davis-Besse would definitely both have positive earnings per share impact.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","How about 2017 or 2018 based on the current forwards on capacity payments?","Donald R. Schneider - President, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.","I don't think we're giving any guidance on forward years, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Because I mean, we are all struggling I think with the impact of your PPAs on your bottom line because we just don't know what's the offset from the current earnings power of these assets. That's why I am asking?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I understand you are struggling with it, and I understand that the estimates are all over the board for what this ESP means.

If we don't have an answer, then we're going to give you 2016 guidance without the ESP.

Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, we are a regulated utility. 90%-plus of our earnings today come from our regulated operations. What we're talking about is growth and investment inside that regulated utility. We filed our integrated resource plan with West Virginia. I think later this year, they'll start taking a look at it seriously, and it's up to the West Virginia Commission to decide would Pleasants be the appropriate solution. Obviously, we have a model in place already with Harrison, and we think that is something they ought to look at.","Anthony C.

Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Real quick, do you ever put or can you discuss what you think the scale of the MAIT investment could be over a multi-year time? I mean, should we think about it similar to the size and scale of what ATSI and TrAIL have been? Now, I know lots of TrAIL was just one big project, but ATSI was a series of projects. Is it something that could be significantly smaller or significantly bigger? Just trying to get arms around how you're \u2013 I don't know how you are thinking about the size, scale and scope of MAIT could be?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, first of all, let me clarify again. We've told you we have over $15 billion of Transmission projects that our teams already identified on our existing 24,000 miles of Transmission System. Those projects can be executed with or without MAIT. MAIT is a vehicle to improve the recovery mechanism from a transparency perspective for investors and lower the cost of capital to make those investments more efficient for customers. That's all MAIT is. It doesn't stop us from moving forward with the transmission investment program.","As far as the scale of the program, we'll talk to you about that once we know the base of the company that we're operating on after we get a resolution on this ESP, because it's more driven by our capability of raising the cash and likely some equity to fund it. So we'll tell you about that once we know those answers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around MAIT. The transmission in the Eastern part of your service territories seems like a huge opportunity in terms of the rate base growth there. And just trying to get my arms around kind of the magnitude of the impact over time.","One other question for you. O&M, where do you see the greatest opportunities across your businesses to manage O&M further down and you've done a really good job over the last year or so in doing so. Where do you see the incremental opportunities and where potentially are their headwinds?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't think of it necessarily as managing O&M down. I think about it as spending the appropriate amount of O&M to serve our customers the right way. And as we invest in new equipment, O&M is going to trend down. In the Transmission System, we're replacing 60-year and 70-year old equipment with brand new equipment, that as I've shared before we're basically buying with 30-year warranties from the manufacturer \u2013 full warranties where we don't have to do any O&M on them.","So we're going to spend the appropriate O&M as long as we're having rate cases and we're having timely recovery of our expenses, I think the shareholders are immune to how much O&M is involved. And so when you think about it, it's more about where do we spend it, how is it being recovered and is this the right amount for customers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks Chuck. Much appreciated.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Take care Michael.","Operator","Thank you. We're showing time for one additional question today. Our last question will be coming from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, Thank you. Most of...","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...my questions have been answered. Just quickly on strategic direction in M&A, I guess if the Ohio PPA goes one way or the other, does that change your view around how you think about M&A in general? There's clearly a lot of M&A that happened last year, it continues to be top of M&A this year. So, if you could just broadly \u2013 now that you're going more towards the regulated platform and clearly as you said, you are a regulated utility, how are you thinking about strategic direction in M&A in that context?","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Of all the things I've been thinking about a CEO the last 16 months, M&A is not high on that priority. That's how I would answer that. We're trying to strengthen the company that we know. We're a big company; we have 6 million customers to serve. We're going to do that the right way.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Before we leave, I have one final announcement that I'd like to make. Many of you know Rey Jimenez, Rey has been part of our IR team at FirstEnergy since 1997, and he has decided that he would rather spend his time in retirement than talking to all of you in the future.","So, he is going to be retiring after 39 years with the company. He will be in the office until early June and I'd encourage you \u2013 I know many of you have worked with him, to get a chance to wish him the best as we will for a healthy and happy retirement. So, just wanted to make that announcement.","Thank you all again for your support and confidence, and we'll be talking to you again as soon as we have an answer from FERC.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today's call, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corporation. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the PowerPoint presentation which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim Pearson.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Meghan, and good morning, everyone. We are changing up the order today. I'm going to lead off with a discussion of our first quarter financial results and then I'll turn it over to Chuck for a review of recent developments and strategic updates.","We are off to a very strong start in 2017 with solid first quarter results that exceeded our operating earnings guidance and were supported by excellent operational performance across the company. We continue to execute on our regulated growth initiatives and, as Chuck will discuss later, we are encouraged by recent energy policy discussions that could ultimately have a positive impact on the nation's electric system.","Last night, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share, which includes a $164 million pre-tax charge related to two coal contract disputes. Chuck will discuss this item later in the call.","First quarter operating earnings were $0.78 per share, reflecting strong results in all three business units. Before I walk through each segment, I'll remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which is posted on our website.","In our Distribution business first quarter earnings increased due to the impact of new rates that went into effect in January at eight of our 10 operating companies. As you'll recall, the Ohio distribution modernization rider and the new base rates in New Jersey became effective on January 1, while new base rates in Pennsylvania were put in place on January 27.","Weather was unseasonably mild across our service area, with heating degree days averaging 8% lower than the first quarter of 2016 and 16% below normal. This drove a 1% decrease in total distribution deliveries, with sales to residential and commercial customers down 3% and 1% respectively.","On a weather-adjusted basis, however, sales within both segments have improved slightly on both a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis, due primarily to growth in customer count. And we are very pleased to see a continued positive trend in our Industrial segment where deliveries were up for the third consecutive quarter as a result of higher usage in the shale, steel, and mining sectors.","Turning to our Transmission business, higher revenues related to our ongoing Energizing the Future program drove the improvement in first quarter earnings compared to the same period last year. In March, FERC accepted the formula transmission rates for both MAIT and JCP&L that will go into effect, subject to refund, on July 1 and June 1 respectively.","In the competitive business, commodity margin reflected the expected decrease in capacity revenues related to lower prices that began last June, partially offset by lower depreciation expense that resulted from the asset impairments recorded at the end of 2016. However, overall results for our competitive business exceeded our first quarter operating earnings forecast, primarily due to lower-than-expected planned outage and contractor cost.","The total customer count for the competitive business is now about 920,000, down from 1.6 million a year ago and 1.1 million in January, consistent with our expectations. As we mentioned in February, we expect contract sales totaling 40 million to 45 million megawatt hours this year, with the remainder sold into the spot market.","We are reaffirming 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $475 million for the competitive business and have increased 2018 adjusted EBITDA range to $130 million to $250 million. Again, we are pleased with the performance across our company and the positive start to 2017. We remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing the regulated growth strategy we have outlined.","Last night, we provided a second quarter GAAP earnings forecast of $0.54 to $0.64 per share, with operating earnings guidance of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. For the full year of 2017, we have updated our GAAP earnings forecast to $2.17 to $2.47 per share from the previous range of $2.47 to $2.77 per share, primarily to reflect the charge I mentioned earlier. On an operating earnings basis, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance of $2.70 to $3 per share.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim indicated, I'm going to focus some of the recent developments related to our transition to a regulated company and our goal of exiting commodity-exposed generation by mid-2018.","Overall, I am pleased with our progress on this effort and we're glad to have one of the significant open items resolved. On Wednesday, we announced the outcome of the arbitration decision in the first of two coal transportation contract disputes. In that case, our generation subsidiary reached a settlement in principle with CSX and BNSF for $109 million payable in three annual installments beginning next month and guaranteed by FirstEnergy. In addition to this settlement, we are in active settlement discussions with BNSF and NS on the remaining contract that is in litigation.","The potential settlements would put a significant risk to FES and FirstEnergy behind us. I'll also note that absent these settlements, under accounting rules, we would have been required to take a significant charge this quarter based on the probable outcome of the damage hearings, which would have impacted both FES and FirstEnergy.","We also continue to move forward with our other strategic alternatives for our competitive business. As we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we entered into an agreement in January to sell 1,572 megawatts of Allegheny Energy Supply's gas and hydroelectric generation for $925 million in an all-cash deal. We hope to close this transaction in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and consents from third parties.","We also entered into a $40 million agreement earlier this month to sell a portion of the real property and certain assets at the former Hatfield's Ferry Power Station in Masontown, Pennsylvania for the development of a 1,000 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas facility. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to various closing conditions. Allegheny Energy Supply will continue to own the remaining Hatfield plant facilities and property.","In West Virginia, following a competitive RFP process and recommendation from an independent consultant, our Mon Power utility entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the 1,300 megawatt Pleasants Power Station from Allegheny Energy Supply. At a cost of $195 million or $150 per kilowatt, this option was found to be the lowest cost solution to meet a steadily increasing capacity shortfall in our West Virginia service territory.","The transfer is subject to approval from both the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC. Hearings are scheduled at the Public Service Commission with an order from the Commission expected by year-end. FERC approval is also expected in the fourth quarter. You will recall that Mon Power has issued a second RFP seeking to sell its interest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Project, but we will not be moving forward with that proposed sale at this time.","In addition to these initiatives, we are closely monitoring two important new developments at the state and federal level. On the legislative front, bills were introduced in both the Ohio House and Senate this month that could help keep nuclear assets as part of Ohio's generation mix. The Zero Emission Nuclear Resource Program, or ZEN, is intended to recognize the critical energy security environmental attributes of nuclear power plants in Ohio by compensating them on a per-megawatt-hour basis. This is similar to the programs already in place in New York and Illinois, as well as legislation recently introduced in Connecticut.","The New York and Illinois programs have extended the benefits of four nuclear power plants that were once slated for premature closure. ZEN has the potential to do the same thing for Davis-Besse and Perry, while supporting Ohio jobs, economic growth, reliable and affordable generation, and environmental progress for years to come.","I had the opportunity to testify at the initial hearing on ZEN, which was held in the Ohio House earlier this week. Multiple hearings are expected in each chamber prior to summer recess, and we are working to get a bill on the governor's desk as quickly as possible.","Finally, we are very pleased that the Trump administration has launched an initiative to address the national, economic and security risks associated with the premature closure of baseload generation in our country. As you may know, on April 14, U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, ordered a study to examine the overall value that baseload generation, including coal and nuclear plants, provides to the nation and ensure electric customers continue to benefit from a secure, affordable and resilient grid.","Secretary Perry requested a plan by mid-June that evaluates the extent to which regulations, subsidies and tax policies have impacted the premature retirement of baseload power plants and whether energy markets adequately compensate the inherent benefits of existing baseload assets. We appreciate the administration's strong leadership in this area, and we are fully committed to supporting this effort.","In light of the potential positive impact that either of these developments could have in the near term, the FES board has informed me that it plans to see how the Ohio initiative and the 60-day study at the Department of Energy play out. I believe this approach is in the best interest of both FES and FirstEnergy.","Take a moment to review FES's situation. Based on the potential for the positive federal and state developments, FES will continue to have access to the unregulated money pool. As of March 31, FES and its subsidiaries and FENOC in aggregate were borrowing $50 million from the unregulated money pool. In addition, FES is forecasted to be free cash flow neutral through March of 2018. And this free cash flow neutral position is conservative as it reflects FES satisfying its June 1 bond maturity, lease and interest payments, as well as other obligations.","With continued access to the unregulated money pool and the $500 million secured credit facility from FirstEnergy, which is currently undrawn, we have not moved forward with a parental nuclear support agreement that we discussed last quarter, but may do so in the future if conditions change.","We remained focused on executing our plan to exit the commodity-exposed generation business. I'm encouraged by the possible developments and their potential impact. We should have a better indication of how these items will progress over the next several months.","As Jim said, we're off to a good start in 2017 with strong operating earnings, solid operational performance and progress on our regulated growth strategies. And we continue working to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth to benefit customers, employees and shareholders.","Now I'd like to open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Chuck, you mentioned that the FES board informed FirstEnergy that they'd like to wait for the Department of Energy review and for the Ohio process to play out. Maybe we could talk about Department of Energy just for a moment. I guess I'm thinking about what the range of possible support could be. And I guess I have some skepticism because DOE's authority is somewhat limited. It would require other agencies potentially to get involved. So, even after DOE comes back with a report, isn't there kind of a risk of either a significant amount of time for implementation, risk in implementation, and doesn't that have the potential to sort of drag out the process for exiting the business?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, Stephen, here's what I'm going to say about that DOE initiative, and obviously since it came out, we've had a lot of discussions and I've personally been down in D.C. and talked to people both at DOE and in the administration.","To put a 60-day time on completing this is very aggressive. I think they view it as something that needs to be very aggressive because there are more and more closures of these fuel-secure baseload assets being announced all the time. So I think the administration is serious about this. Our Washington team tells me that this is a very serious initiative.","I don't think we're in any position right now to handicap what they might do at the end of this study. But if their intention is to keep these fuel-secure baseload assets from closing, then they're going to have to do something to make sure that there's a financial incentive for these plants to not close. So I think it's prudent for us to let them do their work.","It's clear DOE is focused on this. The Secretary was speaking at a Bloomberg conference earlier this week and talked about it there and the importance of this. And I'm sure this also clearly ties in to one of the President's key initiatives, which is to protect our coal natural resource and the mining and jobs that go along with that. So I think it's just prudent for us to see where that goes.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understand. And then maybe I could just shift over to the upcoming debt refinancing requirement at FES. What is the current plan in terms of how that would be dealt with?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I cannot speak for FES anymore. As part of our process to move out of this commodity-exposed business, we have set up a separate governance process for FES. It has now an independent board. And while I may have the opportunity to answer their questions from time-to-time, the decisions are theirs.","But I would say that, since they've told me they plan to wait to see this DOE initiative and they're in the money pool, it's likely that they would satisfy those obligations that are coming due in June 1 out of the money pool.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. So they could avail themselves of the money pool presumably. That's an option that's fair to say is on the table?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Correct. But as I've said in my prepared remarks, they will be free cash flow neutral this year, even after satisfying those obligations. So we're not exposing FirstEnergy shareholders to any additional obligation by waiting to see the outcome of this study either.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. I'll let others ask questions. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, Chuck, but there seems to be a change in the timeline. And I understand that the DOE study came up, but I mean you have this June 1 maturity, there's been this discussion about the growing concern, question about FES. You've just extended an additional guarantee to the business.","Is this purely on the back of the DOE study? Or is it that you feel that there's more of a chance to get the Ohio events in support of the nuclear plants? I mean, there seems to be many questions and changes in the strategy around FES as of late.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I would just say this. As far as I see it, there is absolutely no change in the strategic direction that we want to take this company in. We do not want to be exposed to commodity-exposed generation any longer than we have to be.","So let's talk about, just for a minute, the steps we have taken to move towards that. We announced the sale of 1,500, almost 1,600 megawatts of Allegheny Energy Supply assets. We're working on Pleasants. If we complete both of those by the end of the year, which I expect to happen, that's almost 3,000 megawatts less exposure to the commodity markets than what we had.","We completed a major initiative with the banks at the end of last year to restructure our bank lines and position this company for this exit a little differently. We've engaged legal teams and restructuring teams and financial advisors on both sides of the company that have begun the process and are well along in the process to understand what may happen if a bankruptcy or restructuring is the only way for us to exit this business.","But that is a very complicated process and we're working our way through it. That means we have to understand what is the implication for FirstEnergy shareholders on the FirstEnergy side, and that means the FES board has to understand all the implications that they need to deal with on the FirstEnergy Solutions side. That work is ongoing and it is not going to stop.","I think many people assumed that the June 1 maturities would be a trigger. But given the position of FES this year with being free cash flow neutral, I'm not sure that was a good assumption that anybody was making in the first place because they need to be prepared and this company needs to be prepared before we take that step.","And then the last thing I would say is I'm not sure it even affects the timeline. The DOE study is ongoing. It's going to happen quick. When we see the results of that study, then we may say it could affect the timeline. But just the study itself I'm not sure affects the timeline.","So that leaves, I think, in the last piece of your question, Angie, was the guarantee that we gave...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","The guarantee.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. The guarantee that we gave on the rail settlement.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","The rail-centric \u2013 yes.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","And as I said in my remarks, that has been a huge issue hanging over our company since the day I became CEO. Every time I've met with investors, every time I met with the rating agencies, we have talked about it and it's had the potential to be a tremendous exposure.","We found out that, at least on the first case, the arbitration panel ruled against us. And based on that ruling, we were going to be required, under the accounting rules, to book a significant charge around a range of potential outcomes of that settlement. I'll ask Jon Taylor to walk you through the details a little bit, but that number would have had a significant hit to the equity of FirstEnergy, not just FES.","And so the decision to settle that for literally a fraction of that potential claim that would have had to be booked I think was a prudent decision for both FirstEnergy Solutions and FirstEnergy, and shouldn't be taken to mean anything but that, that we're trying to get a risk that's affected my decision-making, the FES board's decision-making, how the rating agencies look at our credit, and how you all look at our company off the table and quantifying it for you so you know what it is. That's all we were trying to do there.","So, Jon, why don't you just take a minute and walk them through the accounting.","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay. So, Angie, as you know, these were long-term contracts we had basically 11 years in dispute. And if you remember, we settled 2012, 2013, and 2014 for about $70 million per year. So, if you do the math, 11 years, $70 million, that's a big number. And that doesn't include escalations, changes in rates, and that type of thing.","So the range could have been anywhere from $600 million to about $1 billion of exposure on a net-present-value basis. So, to get this settlement in place, if you take the after-tax impact of what could have been $600 million to the $164 million, you're preserving $300 million or so of equity. And that's just based on where we thought it might settle out based on discussions with counsel and those types of things.","I mean, if it would have settled out on the high end, I mean you're looking at $600 million of equity that's preserved. So it was something that we thought was the right thing to do.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","And even if the FES board had decided to file to avoid the $109 million payments, that impact would have still occurred on the FirstEnergy books.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And so the last question, so assuming that nothing comes out from the other DOE study but Ohio does come in and support nuclear plants, what happens with the coal plants within FES?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, let me give a range of outcomes I guess. If let's just say nothing happens out of the DOE study, they say everything's (27:00) fine, we're really not that concerned about these baseload assets closing anymore and they move forward. And then let's say Ohio decides they don't want to move forward. I would tell you it's pretty clear, there's only one other alternative left for the FES board to consider at least from the way I see it. Should Ohio move forward with approving the ZEN at its current rate and the plants run very reliably, that's worth about $300 million a year that would flow to those two nuclear units.","That amount in and of itself I don't think is enough to necessarily avoid an FES bankruptcy either. It would be enough potentially for those assets to emerge from bankruptcy and for a reputable nuclear operator be willing to take them on and run them forward. And that is why the ZEN argument is most critical is to make sure those assets are available to the State of Ohio.","And the attributes that they bring in addition to 4,300 jobs that support them, the environmental attributes, the fuel security attributes, and so forth. That's the basis of the legislation. I just want to say, again, we have not made any change in our strategy to exit this commodity-exposed generation business and become a fully regulated company.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. It's Jerimiah Booream. That was a great explanation on the $109 million there. Just wanted to be sure, crystal clear, are there any future obligations that could be guaranteed at the FE level associated with FES at this point that we know of?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","There's the $500 million credit line that, as I mentioned, FES has not drawn down on at all. And beyond that, we've talked about the nuclear support agreement. But as long as they still have the $500 million credit facility, they don't need the nuclear support agreement at this time. So, as of now, nothing that I know of is being contemplated.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Makes sense. And then just a little bit longer-term. At what point should we expect a strategic update on kind of 2019-plus prospects more structurally going forward thinking about the company?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we've got a lot to figure out over the next 6 to 12 months that I think is going to have an impact on that. So I would say let us get through this transition period and then we'll talk to you about what the company looks like after that when we're done.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Just two questions. First, can you talk about the EBITDA guidance increase at the competitive business for 2018 and then about the other coal transportation contract you're in discussions around and whether you took an impairment related to that?","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Greg. It's Jon Taylor. So the 2018 EBITDA increased about $35 million to $40 million. Most of that is just around the fuel rate. We saw $1 lower fuel rate as we worked through 2018. A lot of it's coming from just what nuclear fuel we're going to burn, timing of outages and that type of thing. So it's really just around nuclear fuel and other fuel costs.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","And your second question is, in our 10-Q, we did state that we are booking $164 million total for rail settlement. We're in active discussions with BNSF and NS on the second contract. But, as you know, the second contract hasn't been litigated yet even in front of the arbitration panel. But I think, as I said, they're active discussions and we wouldn't have booked that amount if we didn't have some feel of certainty that we can get it done in that range.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kiani with Cove Key Management. Please proceed with your question.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, John.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Chuck, I have a few questions here. Could you remind me of the history behind the DMR? I guess, it was originally a PPA for FES and what happened? And how it now became the $600 million DMR that we're benefiting from today, please? Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","John, it's going to take the rest of this call for me to give you (32:47)","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Just high level, what the history was behind that? And how it was originally a PPA and then became this? So, just quickly.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. So, obviously we filed an Energy Security Plan that included a PPA as part of it. That was approved 5-0 votes by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission I believe on February 28 of last year. And then was reviewed by FERC. And about seven weeks later, FERC determined that the waiver that we used for that PPA was not valid.","And we went back to the commission in Ohio with an alternative plan. And they came back with the DMR, which is worth $200 million a year for sure three years and up to five years. And the rest of the ESP that we filed was basically approved and stayed in effect. The only thing that changed was the PPA got replaced with the DMR.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","So the way to think about it is that originally the benefit through the PPA would have accrued to FES. And then as it evolved, it became the DMR where that $600 million benefit accrues to the regulated utilities instead of FES. Is that the right way to think about it?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Correct.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Got it. Okay. My next question, please, is have you spoken with the NRC about the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust at FES? And obviously you're working hard to get a ZEN in Ohio and there's some effort going on in Pennsylvania as well. But in the event that you're not able to get that for those assets and, hypothetically, if those assets then are shut in a bankruptcy or some type of restructuring or whatnot, who's going to be on the hook for the liability at the NDT? Because obviously it's fully funded today, but those assets have to be shut early, would flip from being funded to being under-funded by a substantial amount based on our estimates.","So have you spoken with the NRC? And what are their thoughts, if you have, and your thoughts around an insolvent entity being the guarantor of such a liability, please? Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, no, I have not spoken to the NRC. But Sam Belcher, our Chief Nuclear Officer, has been in contact with the NRC and have had very transparent discussions with them about everything going on with regard to our competitive affiliate.","With regards, specifically, to the new Nuclear Decommissioning Trust, if the event arose that these units would be shut down immediately and needed to be placed in safe storage, there would likely be somewhere around $120 million shortfall in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust. The liability for that would be under the competitive affiliate.","Now, how that would ultimately then be adjudicated, I can't speak to that, but it would be about a $120 million shortfall. And that's what would be needed to allow the fuel to decay enough that it could be put in safe, permanent storage.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Would you as the parent consider guaranteeing that in the event that FES is insolvent and can't cover that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I do not see that as the responsibility of the parent.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","I see. Okay. And then the last question is, have you all evaluated, and are you confident \u2013 have you evaluated the potential for \u2013 if all your hard effort and work doesn't result in what you need for FES and if there is a restructuring at some point, have you all evaluated the risk of veil piercing or subcon at the parent company?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, we obviously, as I said, have a legal team, restructuring team, financial advisory team working on the FirstEnergy side of this transaction that is evaluating all those potentials. We are not going to discuss what that evaluation might show or even a range of outcomes of what it might show. But clearly that's a big piece of what we're trying to understand on the FirstEnergy side of things.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Got it. So veil piercing or subcon are just difficult, complicated, obviously, things for you to figure out, so you just don't know yet?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No. We think they're very simple and there shouldn't be any.","John Kiani - Cove Key Management","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Let's just assume that the DOE is going to find that coal and nuclear plants are important base of resources. I mean, FERC has pretty much already found that. You could say that the capacity performance products approval was based on this. I mean, we've certainly heard them verbally talk about it.","I guess what I'm wondering is let's just assume that the DOE study says these are important assets and we don't want them to close. How should we think about the federal government acting, assuming such a study finding? What would actually \u2013 how should we think about that actually \u2013 what they might actually do considering we've already sort of heard this from the federal government before?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, Paul, as I said, I'm not going to try to predict what might happen at the end of this study, but there is a lot of discussion going on in a lot of fronts with regard to what's happening in our country with fuel-secure baseload assets. And it's clear to me, may not be clear to everybody, but it is clear to me that capacity performance hasn't solved this problem.","Our competitive affiliate is on the verge of bankruptcy. It's got 8,000 megawatts of fuel-secure assets in PJM that are not getting paid enough money to keep them open. So I don't think it's working. FERC held a technical conference. They're starting to understand that maybe that it's not working. I think even PJM is now talking about the impact on the resiliency of the grid of these assets closing. And so I think there's a lot of concern being developed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Chuck, I completely agree. I'm not saying that it's working. I guess what I'm wondering is whether or not they'd actually take steps to come to the conclusion that maybe something other than another form of capacity performance or whatever I mean, in other words, should we think about them basically going down the same sort of like market-based approach, which simply hasn't worked, or is there something else in which they \u2013 something more direct and effective might happen than some sort of additional stakeholder process for them to figure out some sort of market-based mechanism to fix it? Do you see what I'm sort of thinking here? I mean we've sort of been down this road where they say there's an issue, they're going to come up with a solution, and the solution doesn't work.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I think that what they do if they decide there's a problem here that they need to fix has to be fast, it has to be clear, and it has to be transparent to those asset owners that it's going to be secure enough for them to keep those assets running. And how they do that? I can't tell you how they're going to do that. We are obviously working fast and furious inside FirstEnergy to develop our own ideas as to how that could happen that hopefully we'll get a chance to inject into the process at some point in time. I know that our industry group, EEI, is also working to see how they can get involved in this issue.","But the real issue for me is I've gotten into it and that you have to read between the lines a little bit. But the Secretary has been very outspoken about the national security implications of allowing these fuel-secure assets to continue to close. And that's a big concern for me too, because we are moving to a place where the bulk electric system in our country, which is tremendously redundant, very sophisticated, is being placed on top of a bulk gas transmission network that is not robust, does not have redundancy, is congested. And any exposure to that bulk gas system then will expose the electric system also.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And just quickly, on the FENOC guarantee, you mentioned that you don't see in the near-term parental support. Can you give us just a little more color as to how the parent guarantee for FENOC might be employed?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, FENOC's operating license with the NRC requires them to at all times have enough liquidity to ensure that in the event that all four of those reactors were to have an issue and need to be placed in safe storage, that they have enough liquidity to do that. That was the whole point behind the nuclear support agreement. As long as they are in the money pool and they have this $500 million secure credit facility that is undrawn, there's no reason for a nuclear support agreement to be in place.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But if there was no nuclear \u2013 if nothing works on the state level or the federal level, what have you, and FES goes into Chapter 11 or whatever, should we think of that FENOC money as basically being potentially an avenue for creditors to get money?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would think not. I mean, that nuclear support agreement has \u2013 we would not agree to a nuclear support agreement that was there for any purpose but what it's intended to be, provide the liquidity in the event that all four units have issues that force them to have to be put in safe storage on an emergency basis.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I see. So economic retirement would not be one of them?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Chuck. Just on the decision to settle the rail case, you mentioned the scenario where if you hadn't settled, you would have had to take this potentially large write-off at FE, which I assume would have been non-cash. Is there a reason that that would have mattered if it was non-cash? Would it have been like a covenant issue or rating agency issue? Because it would seem like, otherwise, I'm not sure why that would have been a concern.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Steve. This is Jim. It would not have tripped any covenant. It probably would have impacted our covenant by about 2%. But, ultimately, it could have been a cash issue, depending on what the arbiters decided. In fact, there's scenarios where the decision could have made a payment demanded in full this year.","So, from our standpoint, a settlement that is in the $50 million range on a cash basis each year for three years and not having to record that large equity hit, we thought that was the prudent thing to do.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Does that mean...","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think that \u2013 go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","It makes sense on the surface if you look at the cost to settle versus that potential liability. I guess, the one thing I wonder though is to the degree that FES is clearly separate and distinct from FE, that's really an FES cost, not an FE cost. So I guess my question would be why would FE commit the money to settle, if it's really an FES cost?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Again, the railroads wouldn't settle without it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. And then just on the kind of comment you made about wanting to get through the DOE and Ohio potential legislation that the FES board also wanted to kind of see this play out, can you just maybe end that sentence by saying, like, play out before what?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I'm just going to be very direct here. I think there was an assumption made that we created this separate governance for FES with a sole purpose of moving towards bankruptcy. That is not why we did it. We did it with the understanding that a bankruptcy or restructuring may at some point become inevitable.","That FES board is sitting there looking at a whole lot of things but I think, clearly, if there is something in the near-term that can make the picture for creditors better, it's prudent for them to look at that too. We didn't go into this with the idea of figuring out how to not pay creditors back what they loaned us in good faith.","And I sit here doing the same thing. I look out for all of you as investors. I'm looking out for our employees and communities, but also sitting here saying if there's a way that we can do better by these creditors, I get paid to do that as a CEO, too.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","That makes sense. Yeah. One last question, just going back to the utilities. Just if we go back to the utility plan that you laid out at EEI, is everything pretty much on track with what you laid out there?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think we're right on track.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Before we take our next question, there are several callers in the queue. In order to address all callers, we ask that you please limit to one question per caller. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dylan Campbell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Morning.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","For the inter-company credit facility between FE Corp. and FES, does the arbitration settlement trigger an event of default? We're just looking at the $50 million limit spelled out in your December 8-K filing.","Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.","Dylan, it's Steve. It does not.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then on your regulated business in New Jersey, do you anticipate filing to get infrastructure trackers and to facilitate more investment and energy efficiency in solar?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I wouldn't say anticipate. I think the outcome of our rig case last year in New Jersey, I think, puts us in a position to have that type of dialogue with the BPU, and we intend to have that dialogue with the BPU about their appetite for an investment program for New Jersey that will drive improved service and reliability for customers. And we'll see if we can do that. But I don't think anticipate would be the right way to say it. We plan to have those discussions.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Two quick items; one is since now FES is going to wait for the DOE, does that maybe lessen the urgency in the Ohio legislature to get a ZEN approved? Because wouldn't it benefit the Ohio legislature to wait also for the DOE?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't think it should lessen any urgency on the part of the Ohio legislature. The whole point of the ZEN is you have two very important assets in Ohio that you need to protect for your state. If they're going to sit around and wait for the federal government, I'm not sure that's prudent on their part. The bills have been introduced. The hearings have started. I think they need to move forward with that.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And just last, I think Beaver Valley, one of the units was previously owned by one of the Ohio utilities or took the output. Does the ZEN cover Beaver Valley or some of the output from Beaver Valley?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","The ZEN does not limit it to Ohio assets. Assets from outside of Ohio are eligible to apply, and then it would ultimately be, if the legislation's approved the way it is, up to the Public Utilities Commission as to whether or not they qualify.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. I don't mean to beat a dead horse and come back to Steve's question, but it troubles me a little that what would have been an executory contract that could have become an unsecured claim and a bankruptcy filing is now being guaranteed by the FE parent because that's incremental liability for the equity holder of FE.","And how much more of that is going to happen as we think about the time vector between now and when a decision on bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy is made, which really goes also to the question John Kiani asked in that, like, what other hidden liabilities are going to move up to the parent balance sheet as we move through time here before we get to a decision point where you say we're not going to guarantee any more of these liabilities?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, Greg, as we were contemplating whether or not to do this parental guarantee, I completely understood that some of you were going to like it and some of you weren't. But that's pretty much what goes along with every single decision that I've made as CEO since I took this job.","I thought it was the right thing to do for FirstEnergy to move forward with this and offer that guarantee. I said earlier, I don't know of anything else that's of this magnitude for sure or anything else at all that would require us to provide further support to our competitive business. It's free cash flow neutral throughout the rest of this year, doesn't need any support.","And essentially, since the day I became CEO, we really have provided nothing to support that business. It's been running on its own and, conversely, when we initiated the CFIP program, much of the improvement in cash flow for this company came from that business and put them in that position where they didn't need any parental support.","Now, we talked about the fact we've got a second contract that's not yet settled but, as I said, we booked $164 million total for the combination of both contracts.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. I appreciate the answer. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christina Ren with Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.","Christina (Ren) Van Het Hoen - Capital Group","Hi. Good morning. I just have a question about the $109 million settlement payments. Is that going to be paid in an equal installment over the three years? And then I know it says there agreed in principle. When will this be, I guess, finalized and what's the risk of it not being finalized?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I wouldn't say it's going to be paid in equal installments, but essentially equal installments. There was some rounding to make it simpler. All three parties have signed a term sheet. So it's a matter of getting a definitive agreement in place. But I don't see any risk to that happening. It just takes a little bit longer to do that. But all three parties have signed the term sheet.","Christina (Ren) Van Het Hoen - Capital Group","Okay. Thank you.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey. This is Jim. I want to say we have a hard stop at 11 o'clock and there's still a number of people on the call. So, if we don't get to you, the IR team will reach out to you to get your questions taken care of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, John.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sort of slightly different topic but also on FES. We noticed in the 2018 drivers that you're talking about nuclear fuel costs of $5 a megawatt hour and I think last quarter you were showing those as $7. What would account for what seemed like quite a big change?","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Jonathan, It's Jon. It just was the timing of when some of the lower cost nuclear fuel was going to be burned. Previously, we thought it was going to be burned 2019 and beyond. But given some of the outages and the like, some of that will be burned in the second half of 2018.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So there's a fuel inventory and timing of burn kind of thing.","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's right. That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And may I just, Chuck, one quick thing on timing. When you committed to 18 months, you didn't know that we were going to have this DOE study and other things that the FES board now wants to wait for. So how do we reconcile that? Or is it \u2013 and how do you feel about that overall timing issue, given now some of these what look like delays?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I need to clarify the difference between a goal and a commitment. Because what I've said is it's our goal to exit by middle of next year. I would never make a commitment because as we began down this path, all of the decisions to complete this exit from commodity-exposed generation are not in my control. But that remains the goal.","And as I said earlier, I'm not sure the DOE study itself is going to take that off track. Now if the DOE study says, hey, we're going to do something and make these assets stay around, then I think we need to wait to see what that solution is before we make any final decision.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like you are endorsing the idea that achieving that goal might be slightly less likely.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I'm not endorsing that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for clarifying.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","If the DOE study does what I believe it should do, then we will take a pause and see how that evaluates. But I'm not sure they're going to agree with me, but I clearly believe we are making a mistake as a country if we continue to let these fuel-secure assets close as rapidly as they are, both nuclear and fossil.","And that's why the states are having to step up to solve this problem because the markets are not taking care of it. They don't reward the security and a lot of the other attributes that these assets bring. So we need to get this fixed as a country. And I applaud the Trump administration and Secretary Perry for getting this process going.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Morning, everyone. Looking at the DMR, I think stuff may have indicated that essentially to support the parent balance sheet and the overall utility balance sheet, it's a transfer of value from rate payers. How do you view the potential for $300 million in ZEN payments that the rate payers would take on? And what type of value are they receiving? Is there a implied value that you guys have estimated from keeping the nuclear plants open?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, that's up to the legislature to determine. The value is 4,300 jobs. The value is fuel security. The value is the zero-emissions environmental attributes that these assets bring. The value is the tax base that it brings to Ohio. The value is $510 million a year of impact on Ohio's gross domestic product that these plants bring.","And Brattle just did a study that would indicate that it will also save customers $1.3 billion in their electric rates over the next 10 years if these assets are there versus if these assets are gone. So, that's the value that they have to quantify. The legislation has a cap of about a $5 increase on customer bills. So, that's the decision that the legislature's going to have to make.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay. Well, we're at the end of our time and, as Jim said, there's a couple more in the queue. Feel free to call Irene and her team, or they'll reach out to you. We'll make sure we get your questions answered.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Irene Prezelj","Thanks, Brenda. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session.","Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Jones","Thanks Irene. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us.","Last night we reported solid second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share, along with operating earnings of $0.61 per share, which is above the midpoint of the guidance range, which we provided on our last call.","While the mild spring weather across our service territory contributed to lower distribution sales this quarter, our results benefited from continued transmission rate base growth related to our Energizing the Future program, as well as lower expenses.","We are executing on our plans to focus on customer service oriented growth, as we strengthen our distribution and transmission systems and prepare them for the grid of the future. As promised, these strategies are producing solid and consistent earnings growth that is in line with our guidance. The only downside I see, as you may start to find our calls a little boring, but seriously, I'm very excited about where we are at, at FirstEnergy, but more importantly, where we are going.","Let's start with a review of some of the recent developments in our business over the last few months, then Steve will walk you through the results and as always, we will have ample time for your questions.","In our transmission business, we remain on pace to implement $1.2 billion in Energizing the Future investments this year with 600 to 700 projects on track to come into service during 2019.","Last week we participated in a transmission summit hosted by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Our team brief the commission and staff on the key areas of investment addressed by our Energizing the Future program, the need for this work and the benefits to customers as well as our process for project selection.","When we began our Energizing the Future initiative, a large portion of the work, supported projects required by regulators, which included changes taking place in the electric generation sector and supporting local load growth.","Today our transmission system is expected to withstand cyber-attacks and extreme weather events, help predict when maintenance is needed and limit the impact of outages when they occur. Reflecting the shift, our investments are focused on utilizing technology to modernize the grid, enhance security and create greater operational flexibility, while also upgrading aging infrastructure.","As we discussed last quarter, these investments are designed to significantly reduce the impact of transmission outages on our electric customers. For example, where work has been completed in our ATSI service areas since 2014, we've recognized nearly 50% reduction in the duration of customer interruptions caused by transmission outages and a 52% reduction in the number of customers affected by such outages.","I would like to remind you that one transmission outage can impact tens of thousands of customers, saw 50% reduction in outage events is providing tremendous reliability benefits. To manage the hundreds of transmission projects in various stages of planning, development and construction each year, we are implementing our new performance management process called achieving performance excellence or ApEx. The goal is to refine our transmission project management processes into a more structured, consistent and efficient method of delivering projects as designed on time and on budget.","Turning to our distribution business. On May 23rd, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our modified long-term infrastructure investment plans or LTIIPs, the plans increase the spending in each of our four Pennsylvania operating companies in 2019 by total of about $85 million.","This includes accelerating capital that was planned for 2020 as well as additional capital to support enhancing reliability in the state. We are currently recovering these investments through the DISC Rider at all four utilities.","Next month, we plan to file new LTIIPs that will outline our Pennsylvania operating companies incremental reliability spending plan for the 2020 through 2024 period. Before we move from Pennsylvania, I will mention that we have signed a non-binding term sheet to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2.","This would transfer the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the responsibility for decommissioning to a subsidiary of Energy Solutions, LLC., an industry leader in the nuclear decommissioning business.","As background TMI-2 is currently license to do GPU Nuclear and owned by Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L. We acquired in 2001 as part of the GPU merger, since it was not an operating plan, it was never part of FES or FENOC.","While we are still to beginning of the process, which requires numerous regulatory approvals, this agreement would transfer future nuclear obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus.","Turning to New Jersey. The BPU approved our JCP&L Reliability Plus plan in early May and we've begun to implement this infrastructure investment plan with projects designed to enhance the safety, reliability and resiliency of our New Jersey distribution system.","One of the first projects is installation of 1700 new TripSaver automated reclosing devices on local neighborhood powerlines. These devices help limit the frequency and duration of service interruptions by automatically detecting issues, isolating outages and pinpointing the location of problems to help speed restoration.","Now let's turn to Ohio, where there has been quite a bit of activity over the last several weeks. Last week, we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for our grid modernization program. With investments of $516 million over three years.","The stipulation was approved unanimously by all five commissioners and the commissioners complemented the parties on reaching a global settlement that resolved many issues with a broad base of support. This order also fully resolves the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Ohio, with our customers receiving 100% of the tax savings. We expect related refunds to begin this quarter.","In addition, we will begin the work to further modernize our Ohio electric distribution system. The program is designed to reduce the number and duration of outages and help our customers make inform decisions about their energy usage with advanced metering and communications.","On July 15th, we filed our 2018 Significantly Excessive Earnings Test or SEET results with PUCO for each of our three Ohio utilities. Each utilities individual 2018 return on equity was well below our calculated SEET threshold and the consolidated ROE for our Ohio companies was 8.8% also well below calculated threshold.","The Ohio operating budget approved last week included an amendment allows us to combine our Ohio results under a single SEET review. This change will not increase our customers rates, it preserves an important consumer protection and maintains the ability of the PUCO and other interested stakeholders to assess our annual earnings. At the same time, it allows us to implement our rate plan in a manner that best serves customers across our entire Ohio footprint.","In other developments, House Bill 6 was approved by the Ohio legislature and signed by Governor DeWine yesterday. As you know, the key issue of House Bill 6 is a support it provides to nuclear assets in the state, while we no longer own this generation, we believe this legislation is good for our customers, because it will contribute to the state's economic success and the security and resiliency of the regional electric grid, while mitigating the potential impact of uncertain electric markets on our customers' electric bills now and in the future.","House Bill 6 also includes provisions that allow electric utilities to implement a decoupling mechanism, which further supports energy efficiency initiatives that benefit Ohio customers, while providing revenue certainty to utilities. It was set residential and commercial base distribution related revenues at the levels collected in 2018, breaking the link between revenue and the amount of electricity consumed. We are reviewing the potential impacts to our customers and the companies and could seek approval for this mechanism later in the year.","Finally, I know many of you are interested in the status of our Distribution Modernization Rider, as a bit of background this rider was approved by the PUCO in 2016. It initially allowed the collection of $204 million in revenues each year for three years and that was adjusted to $168 million in 2018 after tax reform. 2019 is the last year of the initial rider, although we filed earlier this year to extend the DMR for two more years.","In June, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a 4-3 decision calling for removal of rider DMR from our Ohio Company's current rates. But the court recognized that the funds already recovered under the rider are not subject to refund. Earlier this month, our Ohio utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the court.","We firmly believe the DMR was benefiting our customers by jumpstarting our investments and grid modernization and we believe we have a solid legal argument to support our position. However, along with the motion for reconsideration, we proactively filed with the PUCO to make the DMR charges billed during the reconsideration period, which began July 1st subject to refund, if the court ultimately orders the rider DMR must be removed from our rate plan.","Given our performance year-to-date, we are affirming our 2019 operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per share. If we do not ultimately recover the approximately $0.12 per share contribution from the DMR for the second half of the year, we would expect results in the lower half of this range.","We are also introducing a third quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.68 to $0.80 per share including the DMR of $0.06 per share. Finally, we are affirming our long-term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 6% to 8% from 2018 through 2021. You'll recall that the DMR has never been included in our growth projections.","Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the second quarter and the first half of the year.","Steve Strah","Good morning, everyone. It's good to speak with you today.","As always, I'll begin with a couple of housekeeping items. First, reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document.","Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis, this provides the best comparative view of our performance. As of July 22nd, there are currently 181,520 preferred shares outstanding, with conversions expected to be completed by January of 2020","Now let's look at our results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share. Operating earnings were $0.61 per share, as Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In our distribution business, our results were primarily impacted by very mild spring weather, which contrasted with a very hot spring in 2018.","This drove lower load across all three of our customer classes. Results also reflect the absence of last year's benefit from a court ruling on cost incurred for renewable energy credits in Ohio. These factors were slightly offset by the impact of lower expenses and income taxes.","Total distribution deliveries decreased compared to the second quarter of 2018 both in actual and weather-adjusted basis. Heating degree days were 20% below normal for the second quarter and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2018, while cooling degree days were about 4% below normal and 28% below the same period in 2018.","Residential sales decreased 9.7% on an actual basis compared to the second quarter of 2018% and 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis. Overall, our weather-adjusted residential sales have grown modestly over the last 12-month period.","Second quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 5.6% on an actual basis and about 3.2%, when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load decreased 1.7% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel and automotive manufacturers.","If you look back at the second quarter of 2018, steel sector usage was about the highest we've seen over the last four-year period and our automotive sector still included the now closed GM Lordstown plant. These changes contributed to the tough year-over-year comparison.","Moving to our transmission business. Earnings increased as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative. And at our corporate segment, second quarter results reflect lower operating expenses, which offset higher net financing costs.","Before I open the call to your questions, I'll review a few items within recent ratings activity. We are pleased that Moody's upgraded the credit ratings yesterday of several of our utilities. Ohio Edison and Penn Power were both upgraded from Baa1 to A3. CEI was upgraded from Baa3 to Baa2 and Toledo Edison was upgraded 2 notches from Baa3 to be Baa1. The ratings outlook is positive for Ohio Edison and Penn Power and stable for CEI and Toledo Edison.","We believe these upgrades in addition of those earlier this year by Moody's for ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L demonstrate the underlying strength and positive momentum of our regulated platform. In addition, as you may know, S&P recently revised its group rating methodology, which is used to determine issuer credit ratings for entities that are part of corporate groups.","As a result, we expect to see positive actions for several of our operating companies that have a stronger credit ratings profile than the consolidated group. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and through the first half of this year, we remain focused on meeting our commitments to the investment community and executing our plans.","Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumolin-Smith","So want to go back over this and I acknowledge at the outset that this is still early days in implementing this, but can you elaborate a little bit on the mechanics of this decoupling element. I know there is a 90-day element to file for it, but how exactly, would it be implemented with respect to full year 2019. And then secondly, in addition of the mechanics of filing for it and applying it to the 2019 year, how should we think about establishing 2018 rates that might be the trickier piece here.","But how do we understand 2018 versus 2019 and I appreciate the nuance that you have these other tracker mechanism in place that make it a little bit apples and oranges at least from our side to see it comparably. So if you don't mind, because I get at the end of the day this is a decoupling mechanism, but there is a few nuances here?","Chuck Jones","Well, let me try to tackle it at a high level first and I don't think we're going to be prepared to speak to the exact nuances and how it's going to affect either 2018 and 2019 till we get a chance to fully analyze it. But the bill was our clean energy bill at its heart the decoupling is included in the bill to support Ohio\u2019s clean energy goals. It allows all of the utilities to continue to work with customers to drive further energy efficiencies without a concern for the impact on the revenues with the companies.","In Ohio, we have a shared mechanism for lost distribution revenue that this now eliminates the need for us to worry about that. And it's ultimately going to - it will help reduce customer bills because that energy efficiency mandates on our bills, we're going to grow significantly over the next several years. AEP, Duke and DPL already had some type of decoupling mechanisms in place. And I\u2019ll point out this applies to the base rates only and as you already said Julien, it's a 90-day period before it goes into effect and then 30 days.","So we're looking at November 20th would be the earliest date that we could file for being included under this new decoupling mechanism. And the commission would ultimately has 60 days to make a decision. So that pushes it till January 19th. For me, as I look at it, I think if you combine the decoupling opportunity with the seat provisions that were combined - that were included in the budget bill with our ESP that's already in place through 2024. It puts us in a position for our Ohio companies where the base distribution revenues can be very predictable and very strong.","And the growth in our Ohio utilities is going to come from continued investments in the DCR rider and the 516 million that was just approved for the grid modernization rider. So I think it's going to ultimately provide a very clear and transparent story for our three Ohio companies, but I just can't give you the specifics on the details of how it affects 2018 and 2019 just yet. We've got to get into it.","Julien Dumolin-Smith","Maybe let me make this simpler, just to help frame this. Because I suppose, if you look at year-over-year comps, like you just did. I mean how much are you down year-over-year on weather as you think about it and if you were to think about it specifically for our Ohio if that might be an easier way to just frame it, just year-to-date. Can you tell me if that's appropriate to?","Chuck Jones","Yes, Steve is going to answer the weather issue.","Steve Strah","Yes, maybe I can tackle the weather at a high level issue Julien as we try to compare two very different quarters when you look at 2019 versus 2018. 2018 was very hot weather, it makes the quarter-over-quarter comparison challenging weather adjustment for us is art part science. And this is just one quarter, so it's kind of dangerous to compare them year-over-year.","When you look at our trailing 12-month average, I think I'm more comfortable, looking at that and really on an overall basis total loads are about 0.2% to the positive. So we view that as the broader indicator. And I think Ohio tracks along very well with that comparison. Hopefully that helps.","Julien Dumolin-Smith","And just again to clarify the last question there. Since, you would file potentially on November 20th earliest that could still apply to 2019, even if you don't get a decision until June 2019. Just to clarify that last piece of the process?","Steve Strah","Yes.","Julien Dumolin-Smith","Excellent, well, thank you all very much.","Chuck Jones","And on this topic, I just want to take a moment to say how great it is in the State of Ohio to have leadership in Columbus, who actually looks at issues and is willing to lead. I want to complement our Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Senate President, Speaker of the House, numerous members of the legislature and Senate, and the Chairman of the Commission because they all work together on a very complex bill here.","With a goal I think of providing stable and transparent rates for customers going forward and keeping their Ohio utilities strong at the same time. I think they came up with an approach that was very strong in terms of looking out for this industry and our customers in the State of Ohio.","Operator","Our next questions are from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research.","Charles Fishman","Chuck I either had a bad assumption or - a memory here. I always thought the plan on TMI was to wait until unit one retires and then do both of them together. I guess my first question is, am I wrong about that. And then related to that is, I realize you're just at a term sheet, but what we've seen with other nuclear owners that have retired plants. And I'm assuming this is what's going to happen with energy solutions they take over the trust fund in exchange for all the responsibilities of the decommissioning and decontamination.","And then what you would do once you have a signed contract is or the two of you acting together since they can accelerate this decommissioning. You would go ahead and derisk the trust fund and certainly there is a good time to be doing that. So there'll be plenty of money in that is. Do I have this correct right?","Chuck Jones","Well, let me kind of take it from the beginning. First, I don't believe there was ever any plan to decommission both units together. One unit is owned by Exelon, one unit is owned by FirstEnergy through GPU nuclear and the utilities as I said. And I think both Exelon and us are going to make our own decisions about how to move forward with our assets. Our decision was up until now we've been relying on Exelon for some support with TMI-2. And there is ongoing monitoring and things you have to do that now that they have made the decision to close TMI-1 that caused us to start looking more seriously at what we needed to do with TMI-2.","And I think that basically what I'm trying to say is the term sheet outlines an approach whereby all of the liability for decommissioning along with the decommissioning fund the license, the property, the assets, will all be transferred to Energy Solutions and it will get FirstEnergy out of the nuclear business entirely.","Charles Fishman","And there's plenty of money in the trust fund.","Chuck Jones","Well, I think that's the thesis from Energy Solutions perspective is, that they\u2019re good at this. There is plenty of money in the trust fund and they believe they can execute and decommission it for less than what's in the trust fund with whatever is left over being their margin so to speak on the decommissioning.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho.","Paul Fremont","I guess first question would be, I noticed on the pension that the slide is unchanged from the fourth quarter but interest rates, I think are substantially lower than they were in the fourth quarter. Can you provide any type of an update on what the unfunded pension liability would be at the end of this year versus sort of the 1.6 billion that you were indicating, I think in that slide?","Chuck Jones","I'll turn it over to Steve, but I'll point out that it's July and while the returns on our pension have been doing really well. Last year December was a horrible month and caught everybody by surprise. So we can't really predict in July, what we think is going to happen, but we can give you. And Steve will give you a kind of a year-to-date outlook on where we're at.","Paul Fremont","Great.","Steve Strah","Paul, it's Steve Starh. So Chuck -- it's only July, we've really won't have a clear picture until we get to the end of the year. Specifically on what the asset performances as well as the impact of the full yield, yield curve. But right now based on what we know our funded status is right around 82%.","Paul Fremont","So that actually that's consistent with where, what the slide would show it to be right?","Steve Strah","Yes. So we ended 2018 right around 77% and keep in mind, we made a $500 million contribution earlier this year, so that benefited us and so the impacts that we have related to our return on assets are basically offset by the change in the full yield curve to date. So that washes and so the $500 million contribution really improved our funded status from 77% to 82%.","Chuck Jones","And I would just round it off by saying, we don't see a need for an additional contribution through our planning period through 2021.","Paul Fremont","And then any update on when you might provide an indication of growth beyond 2021.","Steve Strah","Not before EEI this year at their earliest.","Paul Fremont","And then sort of last question on the CapEx guidance that you're providing particularly for Ohio and New Jersey, does that reflect the settlement because you're still providing sort of a fairly wide range is in both of those jurisdictions. And is there -- and if it doesn't, you sort of, provide an update as to where you would see yourself in the ranges for both for both Ohio and New Jersey?","Steve Strah","It does reflect a settlements and we provide the ranges. Just to give us some flexibility as the years unfold to move some money around from state to state transmission to distribution et cetera for things that come up that are unforeseen and that's the only reason the ranges are there. I think you can expect us to be total capital and that $2.8 billion to $3 billion range each of the next several years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Two questions. First of all on the distribution business, how are you thinking about the outlook for O&M and O&M growth over the next year or so?","Chuck Jones","I would say we're look -- thinking about it being flat.","Michael Lapides","So keeping O&M growth relatively flat versus what a 2018 ongoing O&M level at 2019 level or I'm just trying to think about what the baseline is?","Chuck Jones","I would say the baselines been where the baseline spend but we just, we just went through our FE Tomorrow program which reduced some of our obviously corporate O&M and exceeded our original targets by $50 million.","So that's all been baked in to our current numbers going forward as we make these investments in transmission and distribution. What we're trying to do is make investments that have offsetting reductions in O&M that can allow us to kind of keep our O&M flat as things like wages and the cost of material and supplies go up incrementally each year.","Michael Lapides","One other and a little bit of an unrelated question, you've tracked pretty well in kind of weather normalized especially industrial demand in West Virginia. At what point does this create a need for new infrastructure for you guys to build out and how do you think about kind of the timing of when that's needed, and whether its generation or significant transmission or even substation build out and B, how do you go about getting recovery on that?","Chuck Jones","Well, of new businesses part of what we deal with every single year inside both our distribution and transmission budgets. In transmission there have been several fairly substantial projects in recent years, dealing with the shale gas development in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in particular, so we cover all of that within those existing capital budgets.","We plan for a certain amount, it moves around each year, but new business as part of what we plan for every single year and there is no need to really I think contemplate anything exceptional there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil.","Andrew Weisel","I\u2019ve got a question on the treatment of writers, particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania. So obviously the DMR court decision was an unfavorable one. My question is the money that you were planning to spend for that program, will you continue to spend it and just seek recovery through a more traditional Avenue notwithstanding, in the rate freeze in Ohio, but should I think of that CapEx money as still going to be spent or is it going to be maybe downsize or postponed and I understand you work within very wide range of the guidance. That's very clear. I'm just wondering about the outlook for the actual spending?","Chuck Jones","I think you should think of it this way, I mean first of all, we're very disappointed, as I said in the court ruling. And we think we've made a rehearing application that has strong legal basis, but the cash that came from that rider it was factored into our capital plan, which I already said is going to be $2.8 billion to $3 billion each year for the next several years across the whole footprint. It's not going to affect what we spend on capital. It's not going to affect our growth rate over the period. In fact, nobody ever gave us credit for it anyway. And now, it's a big deal when it's not going to be there for two quarters, it's cash and we've worked hard to strengthen our balance sheet.","Steve articulated, particularly the recent credit rating agency actions on our Ohio utilities with upgrades at all of them in a double upgrade at one of them. So the impact of the cash is we don't like it, but it's not going to take us off track from the story that we're telling you, which is 6% to 8% growth and solid movement in Ohio with the CR and the grid mod writers.","Andrew Weisel","And then a similar parallel questions for Pennsylvania, you have the upcoming LTIIP filing for 2020 to 2024, should we, when you give the CapEx guidance for Pennsylvania you split it into stated in formula, should we think of maybe how can you give us a little sneak preview as to the size of what that filing might look like. Maybe I'll ask it that way.","Chuck Jones","I don't think we can and we're still formulating it and until we know exactly which projects and which -- what our goals are going to be, we can't. But, but the range of capital that we give you is a range. That's large enough that if we decide to expand LTIIP it would take us to the top end of that range if we decide to keep it where it's at we may hang at the bottom of that range, but I think you can expect, as I've said somewhere on the order of $2.8 billion to $3 billion of capital invested in our companies over the next several years every year.","Andrew Weisel","So if the outcome of that process is lower end of the reign type of number, would that just mean that you'll have to recover the capital through traditional rate case maybe a little sooner than if the LTIIP were larger, its that the way to think about it?","Chuck Jones","No, I think what we file and LTIIP. We have the ability to recover through the desk and then ultimately, when we get to the point where it's 5% of revenues for our company, then we'll have to have a base rate case to continue, but I don't think you should expect us to tell you anything unless, unless that capital range that we've given you would change for some reason other than that we have that range to allow flexibility for us to manage the different things that come out throughout the year at all these companies.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Chuck Jones","All right. Well, it will be I think our shortest earnings call. I hope you weren't too bored. But it feels good to be where we're at. And thank you for your support. Look forward to talking to you with the third quarter call","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj. You may begin.","Irene Prezelj","Thank you, Latonya, and good afternoon. During this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects, and other aspects of the business of FirstEnergy Corp. are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.","Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which was released earlier today and is also available on our website under the Earnings Release link. Reconciliations to GAAP for the non-GAAP earnings measures we will be referring to today are also contained in that report as well as on the Investor Information section on our website at www.FirstEnergyCorp.com\/ir.","Participating in today\u2019s call are Tony Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Clark, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer; and Harvey Wagner, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Alexander","Thanks Irene and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, I\u2019ll provide an update on our plant and retail operations, regulatory matters and the impact of recent storms. I\u2019ll finish with a discussion of our non-GAAP earnings guidance, and then Mark will talk about our earnings drivers and provide the detail on our second quarter results.","Let\u2019s get started with an update on our generating units. As mentioned on previous occasions, we\u2019ve been rigorously evaluating the environmental controls that will be needed to meet the new environmental regulations including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule or MATS that is scheduled to go into effect in 2015.","As a result of this analysis, we have significantly reduced our projected capital investment related to MATS compliance. We now estimate investment of about $975 million across our Fossil Fleet. This is down from the $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion estimate we provided in February and well below our initial projections of $2 billion to $3 billion. While we still have work to do to confirm and refine our current estimate, we\u2019re clearly moving in the right direction.","At the same time, we\u2019re moving forward with our previously announced plan to deactivate units at seven of our older coal-fired plants by September 1st of this year. Again, as a result of the MATS and other environmental rules, the effective units are Eastlake 4 and 5, Bay Shore 2, 3 and 4 and the Armstrong or R. Paul Smith, Albright, Willow Island and Rivesville plants. We expect to continue operating Eastlake 1 through 3, Lakeshore and Ashtabula until early 2015 coinciding with the conclusion of reliability must run or RMR arrangements with the PJM interconnection. We filed with FERC regarding RMR compensation for these units in July.","As you recall, we also proposed to construct four gas-fired simple cycle peaking units totaling 832 megawatts at the Eastlake plant. This proposal was contingent on the capacity clearing the PJM capacity auction which was held in May. However, these units did not clear and as a result we will not proceed with their construction at this time.","As we make changes in our generating fleet, we are moving forward with a number of transmission projects that have been approved by PJM and will be implemented over the next several years in practically all of our service territories Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey and Maryland. A number of these projects are specifically designed to help address potential issues related to plant deactivations in the ATSI zone in northern Ohio.","One of those projects includes converting the Eastlake and Lake Shore units to synchronous condensers. We are currently projecting a capital spend of $700 million to $900 million through 2016 for these transmission related projects across the five state region, and we expect these transmission investments to be an important part of our growth going forward.","Now, let\u2019s move now to a review of current regulatory activity. In New Jersey, the Board of Public Utilities agreed with the rate counsel\u2019s request for a base rate case for our JCP&L utility. We continue to believe that there is no basis for the rate counsel\u2019s claims, in fact JCP&L\u2019s rates have decreased by approximately 10% since 2008 and are the lowest electric rates among the four New Jersey electric distribution companies regulated by the BPU.","We\u2019re preparing for our case and plan to file by November 1st as requested by the commission. Looking at our Ohio operations, last month the Public Utilities Commission approved our utility\u2019s proposed electric security plan, which is essentially a two-year extension of our current ESP. The new ESP will be effective from June 2014 through May of 2016 and allows Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and Toledo Edison to conduct power auctions to secure generation supply for a longer period of time for customers who do not shop.","This should help shield customers from potential price volatility by blending energy and capacity prices over the term of the plan. Also in Ohio on July 2nd, the PUCO issued an order in the AEP Ohio capacity case that will require AEP to charge competitive suppliers the RPM market price for capacity. This eliminates the pricing capacity proposed by AEP that would have limited customer choice and increased prices.","We are cautiously optimistic that these actions will restore meaningful savings for all AEP Ohio customers who would like to receive service from a competitive supplier and will enhance the market available for FES. But that decision will not be clear or entirely clear until the PUCO rules on the AEP\u2019s modified electric security plan, which is expected later this week.","Market based capacity pricing will give businesses and customers access to electric generation prices that are at historic lows. FirstEnergy Solutions strongly advocated for customers\u2019 right to shop and we believe that these changes if implemented in the right way will result in lower electric bills for customers, an improved business climate in Ohio.","FirstEnergy Solutions continues to prove that competitive markets work. For example, FES increased its customer base by nearly 17% since the second quarter of 2011, producing a 16% increase in retail sales. And while Mark will talk more about FES including an update on our hedged position for the remainder of 2012 and 2013, the continued success of our retail strategy is clear.","It is better positioning our company. Even so we are facing very depressed prices. And at the same time, we\u2019re addressing increased environmental costs and government mandates and policies that impact both the supply and demand of electricity. We will work through these issues and I remain committed to further developing our retail operations and positioning the company to take advantage of improving economic conditions over time.","Finally, let me spend a few minutes on the storms that cut through our utility service territories in late June and early July. During the last weekend in June, a straight-line windstorm, called a Derecho, something I never heard about, tore across central Ohio, Southwestern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia service territories, causing outages for 566,000 of our customers. This windstorm with winds of up to 90 miles per hour caused the most significant damage our company has ever experienced on our transmission grid.","West Virginia was the hardest hit area with more than two-thirds of the 380,000 customers in our Mon Power service territory affected. Restoring service proved very labor-intensive. For example in one remote location, crews had to replace 19 damaged poles to restore power to only a handful of customers. While we were cleaning up from the Derecho, another wave of thunderstorms brought on by the extreme heat caused major outrages in our Toledo, Edison and Jersey Central service territories. These outrages were resolved in a matter of days. Total restoration costs are estimated to be in excess of $130 million, substantiate all of those costs will be incurred in the third quarter. Approximately 70% of the total cost of capital, most of the remainder is expected to be deferred for future recovery. We have deferral mechanisms in place in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and we expect to file for approval to defer the cost in West Virginia later this quarter.","As we announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share. While we remain confident in our long-term strategies, we will continue to assess our operations particularly at our Fossil Fleet in light of the continued sluggish economy and its effect on power prices.","Now I\u2019ll turn over to Mark for an in-depth look at the second quarter. Mark?","Mark Clark","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon everyone. As Tony mentioned, I\u2019ll start with the review of second quarter results then I\u2019ll provide an update on the continued success of our retail strategy and finally I\u2019ll conclude with several comments on next year\u2019s forecast.","Before I move on to the details of our second quarter results, I\u2019ll take this opportunity to remind you of several housekeeping items. First, this is the first quarter we\u2019re presenting our total company results in a combined year-over-year format, fully reflecting our merger with Allegheny Energy. Second, as we did last quarter, we are normalizing the revenues, expenses and output related to the deactivation of our older coal-fired units. And finally, with the integration of Allegheny into our automated financial reporting systems in the second quarter, we\u2019ve modified our regulated reporting segments to isolate all federally regulated transmission operations and state regulated distribution operations as separate segments.","Looking now at second quarter results excluding special items, non-GAAP earnings were $0.60 per share compared to $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2011. On a GAAP basis, this quarter\u2019s earnings were $0.45 per share compared to $0.48 per share in the same period last year.","As we move to the detailed review of second quarter 2012 drivers, it may be helpful for you to refer to the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community that was posted on our website this morning. Special items for the second quarter are detailed on page four of the report. These items have a net impact of decreasing GAAP earnings by $0.15 per share. By comparison, in the second quarter of 2011, special items reduced GAAP earnings by $0.22 per share.","Looking at the special items for the second quarter of 2012, a gain of $0.01 per share related to the impact of non-core asset sales, was offset by the following six items. A charge of $0.07 per share related to plant closing costs, which includes revenues, expenses, and activities to prepare our older coal-fired units for deactivation as a result of environmental regulations; a $0.03 per share decrease in earnings related to merger accounting for commodity contracts; a $0.02 per share decrease related to tax legislative changes; an additional $0.02 per share decrease for mark-to-market adjustments; a $0.01 per share decrease for regulatory charges and finally a $0.01 per share decrease from the impairment of nuclear decommissioning trust securities.","Moving now to distribution deliveries. While the earnings impact of distribution sales was flat compared to the second quarter of 2011, total deliveries increased slightly; however, distribution deliveries have not recovered to the levels we saw in 2007 before the impact of the recession. Industrial deliveries were up 3% and commercial deliveries also increased slightly. In Ohio, we continue to see improving industrial activity, particularly in the steel and automotive industry. In our other states, sales are essentially flat.","These increases and any earnings impact were offset by a 1% decrease in residential deliveries. We attribute this in part to customer conservation efforts in the face of the continuing tough economy where underemployment and unemployment remain a significant factor. This trend seems to be consistent with what other utilities in our region are also reporting.","The impact of weather was slightly positive in the second quarter. The reason for the negligible impact is that temperatures were comparable to those we experienced in the second quarter of 2011 \u2013 a relatively mild April and May followed by a very warm June. Perhaps, the best way to express this is by looking at second quarter 2012 cooling and heating degree days.","Heating degree days were 19% below normal and just 1% below last year, while cooling degree days were 33% above normal, but only 5% above 2011. This trend continued in July: while cooling degree days across our utility service territory were up 39% above normal, they were 3.5% below July of 2011.","Let\u2019s turn now to the items that are highlighted in the earnings variance box on page one of the Consolidated Report. There were three positive drivers. The first is lower operating costs: while we did have more days in nuclear refueling outages they were offset by decreased cost in our ongoing fossil operation as a result of fewer planned outages in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period last year and the benefit of merger synergies and reduced storm costs in our energy delivery business compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Another earnings benefit was lower general taxes, primarily due to lower gross receipts. And finally, we had lower interest expense as a result of recent financing activity.","Moving now to items that reduced second quarter results, first, depreciation costs increased and second, we saw a reduction in other income, which includes lower investment income from the nuclear decommissioning trust and the absence of revenue in the second quarter of 2012 from the sale of pole attachment lease rights in June of 2011.","I\u2019ll conclude our earnings discussion with a review of commodity margin, which is detailed on pages two and three of the consolidated report. In that report, you\u2019ll also find additional information on megawatt hour volumes. To start, actual generation output from our ongoing competitive fleet increased by 1.2 million megawatt hours compared to the second quarter of 2011. Both nuclear and fossil plant utilization increased resulting from fewer refueling outage days across our entire fleet in this quarter compared to the same period last year.","Fuel expense was down for the quarter while purchase power was up essentially offsetting each other for the quarter. While commodity margin had a net negative impact of $0.09 per share, this reflects the interplay of various positive and negative components and overall, we remain very pleased with the performance of our competitive business FirstEnergy Solutions.","You will note that contract sales increased 6% over the second quarter of 2011. Achievements in the quarter included further expansion into the competitive markets in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Maryland as well as growth in both the large and medium commercial and industrial account segments.","Looking more closely at the industrial sales channel, we achieved a 16% increase in direct sales, a 3.5 fold increase in mass market sales and structured sales that increased slightly as new load acquired outsider traditional utility footprint offset the expiration of some municipal and co-op contracts. I think I said industrial sales channels, but I meant to say individual previously I apologize. While government aggregation megawatt hours sales decreased slightly, we began delivering power to 25 additional communities in central and southern Ohio during the second quarter.","One important point to make is that during the second half of the year, we will begin to deliver power under newly signed aggregation contracts with another 48 communities in Ohio and six new communities in Illinois. And POLR sales continued to decrease consistent with the realignment of our sales portfolio as part of our overall retail strategy.","I\u2019ll mention here that FirstEnergy Solutions\u2019 hedged position for the balance of 2012 is 95%, while we are currently at 70% for 2013. Commodity margin for the second quarter of 2012 also benefited from lower congestion, network, transmission, line loss expense. On the other side of the equation, negative drivers of commodity margin were lower capacity revenues primarily as a result of the lower capacity price in the ATSI zone that became effective in June 2012.","The RTO price in June 2012 was $16 per megawatt day compared to $110 per megawatt day in June 2011. Reduced Renewable Energy Credit or REC sales were $0.02 per share, and capacity increase expense increased as a result of FES serving more retail load. Although there are myriad of the factors affecting the net reduction in commodity margin, FES continues to benefit from its strategy of moving megawatt hours sales between channels.","A retail volume increase of 16% helped to partially offset lower prices of approximately $4 per megawatt hour. In the $4 per megawatt hour decrease in overall retail rates, when adjusted for transmission cost changes for Ohio customers and changes in capacity prices is actually a $1 decrease. When you compare this to the dramatic decline of $10 in the wholesale market prices year-over-year, it points to the solid success of our retail program.","While we were challenged by market conditions during the quarter, we strongly believe in our strategy and our business model, and we will continue to take actions we deem necessary to ensure we are well positioned for the eventual economic recovery.","As Tony mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share. Look to next year, we remain confident that the regulated side of the house, which includes our utility and transmission operations will continue to provide a strong foundation and fully support the dividend. We see no change in their strategic role nor in their ability to deliver.","On the competitive side of our business, we\u2019ve seen a significant number of changes, some negative, some positive and some yet unknown that were not anticipated in our earlier forecast. Some of these changes relate to the regulatory side that will have an impact on the competitive side. Just to name three examples that were not included in our prior forecast.","The new ESP 3 in Ohio, the October and January Ohio auctions, and the AEP ESP, and of course the economy, which remains more depressed than we anticipated as well as continued regulatory and political uncertainty will impact our estimates. A simple example was CSAPR.","We expected to be in a position to excel CSAPR allowances given our fleet\u2019s compliance position, yet we still don\u2019t have any answer from the courts as to when or whether CSAPR will become effective. Once we have better clarity around the issues that require updating as well as incorporating changes from our normal fall budgeting process, we will update next year\u2019s earnings forecast.","Thank you very much for listening and now I\u2019d like to open up to calls and your questions. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey good afternoon guys.","Tony Alexander","Hi Dan.","Mark Clark","Hello Dan.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, just on the 2013 number, Mark, I take it as you guys are withdrawing the 2013 guidance number or is this the number you\u2019re keeping but there is you have certainly a number of issues at play that could affect it that we will have to kind of wait and see how they play out for the rest of the year?","Mark Clark","That\u2019s a good question Dan. I think the answer to next year\u2019s forecast is both simple and straightforward. There\u2019ve been a number of substantial changes that will affect next year\u2019s forecast. As I said, some are going to be positive, some are negative, and some we just don\u2019t know yet.","What I do know is that I\u2019m working with a pretty long list of changes, I mentioned the Ohio \u2013 approving the Ohio ESP, extending October-January auctions, storm costs, the New Jersey case, coal transportation, power prices, transmission whether we can accelerate, of course, the big gorilla in the room being the general economy, but let me just address two to give a little bit better flavor.","Our earlier forecast assumed a one-year auction in October and January, while we believe the changes Tony mentioned the three years will help the consumer it will also help FES. Another example was the AEP ESP and as Tony again said we think that\u2019s very positive for the consumer depending on how the commission rules that could be very positive for FES.","And, as you just said the point we\u2019re making is that we need to update a long list of items, which we plan to do along with our normal fall budgeting process. I apologize if that\u2019s a long answer, but it\u2019s a long list of changes that we have to get updated and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, I think I got it. Thank you. And then Tony I guess just, can you share some thoughts kind of out of the RPM auction results and kind of where the pricing went with the big demand, response, consumption in ATSI. How important do you think it is to get a more of a physical resource in that market in the future and your kind of your comfort around reliability in the region as we look forward?","Tony Alexander","Sure Dan, I think demand response when it comes in across a broad region and is not clearly identified in a particular area has some benefit, but it\u2019s not the real type of benefit that you\u2019re looking for in what otherwise are fairly constrained areas.","My sense is we\u2019re going to have to get a better handle on that to determine whether or not it\u2019s usable or it\u2019s just an interesting thing to have, but it will not improve reliability in and around the area. My own sense is that many of the transmission projects including the conversion of the generating units in the \u2013 in and around Cleveland to synchronous condensers will put us in a position to deliver reliable electric service in that area.","It\u2019s going to take some time to put all that in place and that\u2019s why we have the RMR arrangements being contemplated, but we intend to work as aggressively as we can to meet the schedule and to be able to stay within the guide post that we\u2019ve kind of laid out for ourselves and that is basically to not be in a position to be running any of our power plants beyond March of 2015 that we\u2019ve otherwise scheduled to shut down.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And I guess just one last one. As you look at kind of the mix and the retail business or kind of the gain in customer count relative to where your projections were at the Analyst Day, it looks like there might be a little behind on some of the share gains and LCI, MCI maybe relative to plan. Where do you guys think you are in capturing the new customers over the course of the schedule and it was always kind of an assumption that you have an acceleration in the second half of more the government ag activities?","Tony Alexander","Well I think we knew that once our retail group went the government aggregation it was just going to be a question of how fast you can get them transitioned over which as you said was mostly in the second half. I think we\u2019ve had great success in the large commercial, medium-sized commercial, I think we are a little behind in the mass market, but I know they\u2019ve got some good plans to catch back up there. So, Dan I get a weekly report in terms of what we win and what we lose and we\u2019re up for the year across all the different segments particularly in southern Ohio.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Mark Clark","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So first kind of following up on Dan\u2019s first question there. If you could provide a sense of priorities or rather impacts if you will, you listed out those few items, which of those are most impactful and it seems as if a lot of those are actually positive items to 2013 EPS as you think about the update. So, if you were to kind of ballpark it, is this actually a revision downwards or upwards? I apologize if that\u2019s an obvious question.","Mark Clark","I think it\u2019s an obvious question but we don\u2019t have an obvious answer. We just have to get through a long list. I think as we said earlier, the retail group is 70% closed right now for 2013, so power prices are going to impact them. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with the economy, the election, taxes, budget, things like that. Power prices are not a positive, depends on whether the commission rules favorably this week, that could be a positive. One big positive potentially is we\u2019ve reduced the amount of spend on MATS from $1 billion to \u2013 down $1 billion to $2 billion.","We\u2019ve got transmission spend, how much transmission spend can we accelerate into 2012 that\u2019ll affect 2013. So I don\u2019t know if I would characterize any one weighing more than the other. I think we\u2019ve got to get our book closed for 2013. We\u2019ve got to see what power prices are doing, how much more channel switching Donny\u2019s group in retail can do. So as I said, there are some really strong positives.","Power prices are not going to necessarily be a positive and we\u2019ve got to wait for some regulatory outcome and of course a big potential positive would be the auction, since they are now into three years. So good question, I just have a long list of things that we have to get updated, plus as I said before, this is really the time of the year we are doing our normal budgeting process. So we\u2019ve got to get just the normal budgeting updates incorporated.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","All right. Thank you. Maybe a follow-up again kind of to Dan\u2019s original set of questions here on ATSI, as we look forward and as we\u2019ve seen your transmission spend announced in the quarter, how are you guys thinking about, not to jump the gun here, but the 2016, 2017 auction in the ATSI zone and any kind of commentary I imagine, or at least I understand that the transmission is set to go into service prior to the next auction date?","Tony Alexander","Well, Julien, some of it will, some of it will be perhaps beyond that. The real issue I see in terms of being able to get many of those transmission facilities in place, will not necessarily be driven by the construction schedule, but will be more affected by our ability to acquire rights of way, abilities to get outside crews in to support it, and doing that and getting the permits necessary to complete that amount of work in the timeframe that we\u2019ve laid out in front of us.","So, we have some work to do, there\u2019s a lot involved in the process, we\u2019re in the early stages now, we\u2019re preparing environmental impact statements and all of the other parts, pieces and parts that will require regulatory approval, primarily from siting organizations, and as we move in that timeframe, we\u2019ll be better able to predict when we will have the particular parts of those projects in place. Because this is not just one project, there are a number of things that are going to be done. Substations are going to be enhanced, additional ones are going to be built, new lines are going to be brought in to serve those. The synchronous condensers will be put in place. We\u2019ll have to see how all of those impact the schedule that we have now as well as what the loads do in the Cleveland area between now and 2016 and 2017.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you for the clarity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays","Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Ohio ESP approval and the provision where they changed the POLR auctions to three years versus one and just whether you feel that is more attractive from a FirstEnergy Solutions standpoint? And if you\u2019d be more interested in participating in those auctions?","Tony Alexander","Let me address that one first. The primary purpose of this is providing a more gradual glide path for our customers, so that we could take out the volatility that we otherwise would have anticipated happening between today\u2019s pricing, which are based on very low capacity costs in the main, and what we are seeing in the 2014, 2015, 2016 kind of timeframe.","We thought smoothing which is kind of consistent with what our utilities have tried to do for as long as I\u2019ve been actively involved in trying to work through what otherwise are potential spikes in pricing, try to blend that out. From an FES strategy standpoint, whatever that auction is \u2013 it is, our strategy continues to be focused on direct sales to individual customers pulling away from POLR obligations and POLR sales, because we believe that\u2019s the greatest opportunity for this company to be successful over the long term.","We will likely participate in auctions and we do in multiple regions and will likely also participate in these auctions, but again, much of that will depend on where is the status of our retail book of direct sales and how much we have available or do we want to place in that kind of call auction associated with a POLR transaction.","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Good afternoon.","Tony Alexander","Hi, Ashar.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Can I just ask when should we hear back on the new guidance? Is it end of the year? Next year? Or could you give us a timeframe?","Mark Clark","That\u2019s a good question. No, not really. I think we got to get through the whole process as it\u2019s a long list, got to get through our normal budget process. I think our Investor Relations folks told us that there is an Analyst Meeting early in 2013, so it can\u2019t be any later than that and if we get it done sooner we\u2019ll get it done sooner. So, it\u2019s just a lot of work we\u2019ve got to get done between now and then.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay, okay. And then could you just again, I\u2019m sorry to apologize for getting it repeated could you just go over the factors again the changing factors? Could you just repeat them if you don\u2019t mind?","Mark Clark","Well these are just some of the ones off the top of my head that I put down, it\u2019s the approval of the Ohio ESP.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.","Mark Clark","The auction that\u2019s been extended from one year to three years in Ohio for both October and January.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. So that\u2019s a positive, right?","Mark Clark","Right. The storm costs and the request to defer those that Tony mentioned in his text in West Virginia. We\u2019ve got the New Jersey rate case. All the plant deactivations that\u2019s going to affect our coal and transportation costs and those are all being negotiated by FES right now. Our power prices are going to affect the open position, where FES is 70% closed. I think the last time we spoke was somewhere around 50%, 55% something in that range. So they\u2019re right on their glide path and right where they need to be.","I spoke about transmission reliability investments, the fact that we don\u2019t have some of these big capital cost related to MATS, related to the peakers, the $500 million there. How much our transmission group can get accelerated on the transmission side both into 2012 into 2013. Then the big gorilla in the room is the economy, where the economy is going, what\u2019s going to happen with the tax cliff, are they going to extend it, not extend it. So, those are just some of the things that I wrote down really quickly off the top of my head, but I can assure you that the list is three to four times that length.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. And then can I just Mark, just from our purposes, I have not forget I don\u2019t have the presentation in front of me. What had you assumed for the economy for 2013 in terms of growth?","Mark Clark","I think in the distribution side, Jim do you know that \u2013 probably like 1.5%?","James Pearson","About 1% to 1.5%.","Mark Clark","1% to 1.5% on the distribution side, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily affect what the retail group is doing. They\u2019re targeting a set number of megawatt hours at the highest possible margin. So, if the economy is going backwards or forwards, doesn\u2019t really matter to us because at the retail side, they\u2019re targeting a set number of megawatt hours which I think in 2013 is 112 as opposed to 104 in 2012. So, they target megawatt hours, the distribution models and forecasts around the economy, which is I said is somewhere between 1% and 1.5%.","Tony Alexander","But the economy impacts \u2013 the amount available to go after in the market. So, they are integrally tied as to whether or not this economy is going to get back in growing or whether or not we\u2019re going to stay stagnant in 2007 levels. When in fact at the end of the day, we had assumed that this economy was going to get a little bit back on track, it clearly has not yet, and it is impacting the estimates.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you so much","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon.","Mark Clark","Hi, Steven.","Tony Alexander","Hi, Steven.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Wonder if you could talk a bit about the trends you\u2019re seeing in competition levels on the retail side. Mark, you mentioned margins they were down just a fairly modest $1 megawatt hour whereas wholesale prices fell significantly more, is this in line with your expectations, are you seeing certain emerging trends with respect to the degree of competition?","Mark Clark","Actually, I have Donny Schneider he\u2019s the President of the Retail Group. So, I\u2019m just going to let Donny speak for his group.","Donald Schneider","Stephen, clearly the competition is out there. I think we\u2019re doing a great job. One of the things that we monitor very closely is what we call our attrition rates and so these are customers that we\u2019ve traditionally held and whether or not we\u2019re able to retain those.","And in our residential space, when you look across our EDCs we\u2019re 3% to 4% year-to-date attrition in our FE Ohio, that\u2019s more like 1%. So we\u2019re doing very well at being able to retain those customers. In other EDCs where we call them our close to home EDCs, where we go after customers, we\u2019re doing quite well across the board in being able to secure market share that we\u2019d anticipated.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you. And just as shifting gears over to PJM, there have been a number of conversations about the minimum offer price rule and that there is continued discussions about potential modification for that. I was just curious from your perspective how that process has been unfolding, anything just out of the ordinary as you\u2019ve been going though that, is it proceeding as you would hope. How do you see that shaping up in terms of potential changes to the MOPR?","Donald Schneider","Stephen, this is Donny again. Yeah my folks are involved with that. As you know PJM has a very elongated process when it comes to these things. So they\u2019re actively involved. I think it\u2019s a little soon to tell, to speculate on how that might come out. So we\u2019re just going to have to watch it. Obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019re very interested in and we\u2019re paying close attention to that, but a little soon in the process to speculate.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thanks Donny.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Tony Alexander","Good morning Paul.","Mark Clark","Hey Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","I\u2019m sorry. The AEP ESP it sounds like you guys thought that that might turn out positively for you. Is that I mean just wondering what you\u2019re thinking is in terms of what\u2019s going to be coming out there? And whether or not this capacity ruling was \u2013 how that figures in your thinking and also I guess remarks by Duke that they might be looking at this \u2013 the face that they\u2019re an FR entity and therefore they might be able to get a capacity cost. They\u2019re at least looking into that sort of issue. Any thoughts there you want to just elaborate a little bit on?","Leila Vespoli",", this is Leila Vespoli. I think the capacity order that came out was very favorable. They did defer one issue to AEP\u2019s ESP and that was how they were going to handle the deferral between the 188 and RPM. So, we\u2019re still looking to see and I guess that would be tomorrow when the commission issues its order in the APKs and hopefully we\u2019ll get that result positively, and then and kind of have a complete picture with respect to that. With respect to...","Mark Clark","Duke.","Leila Vespoli","Duke, yeah. I apologize, I forgot the second part of the question. With respect to Duke, yes, they have raised issues with respect to that. If you think about how AEP presented their case, they presented a cost-based case and that\u2019s what the commission was looking at. So, in setting AEP\u2019s state based FRR mechanism, they looked at cost. So, if Duke is thinking of trying to implement something like that, from our standpoint they have an ESP that\u2019s in place that incorporated RPM pricing.","Mark Clark","Duke, per day, DPL Go ahead, keep going.","Leila Vespoli","And so with respect to that I think that they would have a huge hurdle to clear with respect to that.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then with respect to peak demand just in the third quarter here we\u2019ve seen a lot of hot weather in the Midwest and we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 and in the East Coast, and we haven\u2019t really seen much in terms of high peaks at PJM, and I was just wondering if you could maybe sort of give us an indication as to what you\u2019re seeing on the demand response side, are you seeing demand response in the energy market which has been sort of a tariff that PJM has put in here, or any sort of comments you\u2019d like to make on that?","Donald Schneider","This is Donny. I think Mark touched on the residential space being down a little bit, what we\u2019re seeing is that for a given number of residential customers, if you assume an EDC where the residential customer count has not changed, the actual consumption is down a little bit, with what we\u2019d normally expect to see with these hot conditions. So, it looks like the economy, the energy efficiency, et cetera is starting to have a bit of a dampening effect on residential consumption.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just finally on, Ashar asked about economic forecast, and as opposed to sort of a sales growth, I was just wondering sort of a GDP forecast, what have you guys been assuming for 2013 just in terms of the economic rebound?","Mark Clark","2.5%, but that really could get changed depending on what happens with the tax cliff. Paul, I don\u2019t know what that number is, but I have seen numbers like 3% to 5%, if they don\u2019t extend it. You subtract that from anything and it\u2019s not pretty \u2013 so but we assumed about 2.5%.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","With regards to your CapEx around environmental, it\u2019s come down pretty considerably. Where have you found that opportunity?","Mark Clark","I think pretty much across the board, I think Tony challenged the folks to come up with creative solutions and they\u2019ve done that. I think coal firing with gas is going to help if the power prices stay low. There is some things we can put off, moving some of the outages around, it\u2019s pretty much across the board. We\u2019re pretty pleased with where they are, but we keep pushing them to lower that number too. So Tony you want to...","Tony Alexander","No, I think it\u2019s just a comprehensive look at each and every unit and each and every plant. And looking more holistically at the plant and its capabilities and what you can do with existing equipment to enhance it and improve it, for example the prove performance of precipitators or tightening up so that you don\u2019t have as many air leaks, a whole series of things unit by unit specific to eliminate kind of the large, bigger ticket items that would otherwise be kind of hung on the back end of the plant because you\u2019re not making the rest of the facility as efficient and as effective as it can be.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","One of the items you mentioned, Mark, around the uncertainty over the 2013 power prices, but you took your open position from 45% to 30% and as you close that 15% how is that pricing relative to what your view was when you did have guidance out there?","Mark Clark","It\u2019s lower. I don\u2019t know, Donny, you want to speak to...","Donald Schneider","Yeah I think, in the first quarter of this year, first and second quarter we saw a dropoff of about $10 a megawatt hour in wholesale prices.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","You all have talked about the offsetting impacts of rising contract sale volumes against the decline in capacity prices and energy prices. There has also been a material mix shift in the composition of your contract sales from POLR to large C&I. And I was wondering if you could comment year-over-year whether the mix-shift has been positive or negative to your commodity margin, or broadly neutral?","Donald Schneider","Hi, Hugh. This is Donny. I would say it\u2019s been very positive. And I\u2019ll just use FE Ohio as my example. If you think about when FE Ohio first opened up, and I\u2019m using FE Ohio as an example; I could use any one of the EDCs as they progress from the beginning to where they are sometime later.","FE Ohio opened up in the spring of 2009. When it first opened up, there was very little shopping and so as you went in there and procured tranches, if you were a participant in POLR, you were receiving a nice margin and a nice volume. As time has went on though, that volume has absolutely crept away from those POLR providers.","Today in FE Ohio, you\u2019re probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 80% of the customers have now shopped. So, if you had only participated in that POLR procurement, not only looking now at 2012 \u2013 not only would your rate have dropped off substantially but more importantly your volume would have been completely or, not completely but 86%, 80% erased from where you were just three short years ago.","So our move from POLR to the LCI, MCI, Gov Agg, et cetera has allowed us to secure that volume.","Mark Clark","Hugh, this is Mark. I would add one additional caveat to what Donny just said, one of the things that we\u2019re working very diligently on and have a lot of algorithms on is, suppose you can move a customer megawatt hours between channels or inside a channel, you\u2019ve got an LCI customer that\u2019s served by one EDC, can you move those megawatt hours over to another EDC in the same channel, but a higher margin or even within the EDC? And one of the big issues that comes up in the large industrial market is can we take those megawatt hours and move them to any of the other channels like mass market or something else? So they spend a lot of time trying to move either within channels or out of channels to increase the margin.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Right, okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up question regarding the radical reduction in your MATS CapEx, is the coal firing with gas likely to be accompanied by a reduction in the variable cost of running the units that coal fire, or given forward prices for coal and gas an increase in variable cost? And I guess if it\u2019s the latter, is it material?","Tony Alexander","Yeah, a lot of that is going \u2013 Hugh, this is Tony. A lot of that is going to depend on the price of natural gas obviously and the relative price nat and coal. We\u2019re looking at it more from an operational standpoint. It\u2019s not going to have some flexibility, but you also have to include all the back-end costs where you are not going to dispose of as much material so and you are not going to need as much material going in to your scrubber systems because you are not having to deal with as much of the effluent. If the coal kind of a relative balance, my sense is it is going to be about neutral. With respect to the overall cost, it could be sometimes plus, it could be sometimes a little negative.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well, hats off to your engineers, that\u2019s a pretty impressive savings.","Tony Alexander","Thanks a lot.","Mark Clark","Thanks. Operator, how about we take one more question?","Operator","Okay. Our last question will be from Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Hi guys, how are you?","Mark Clark","Great, Andy.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Just want to try to clarify something. Obviously, you guys know what you\u2019re doing as far as 2013 and you\u2019ve articulated very clearly that there are numerous moving parts. At the same time obviously by kind of talking the way that you guys have, it has caused some angst in your stock today. And so I just want to give you kind of one more chance to kind of come out and just try to make a little bit clearer whether we should be concerned that there could be a significant revision down to 2013 estimate?","I mean although it seems that a lot of the things are on the positive side, obviously the big gorilla in the room as you\u2019ve mentioned is the economy but I just kind of want to give you one more chance to try to articulate that as your stock is down almost 4% right now?","Mark Clark","Well I can\u2019t articulate why our stock is up or down, there are a lot of factors other than just whatever our forecast is going to be, but at the end of the day we\u2019re trying to say we have an awful lot of changes to make in our forecast and we\u2019re just trying to be honest and upfront about it. Some of those changes are going to be positive as we closed the book on the 20%, 15%, 20% that has to be closed. Chances are it\u2019s going to be at lower prices, chances are we\u2019re going to accelerate some transmission. I couldn\u2019t tell you specifically today what our forecast is going to be so, I don\u2019t know how anybody else is going to be. It is what it is. We\u2019re just trying to be upfront and honest that there is going to be a tremendous number of changes in our forecast from the last time we did it. It\u2019s a simple and straightforward statement.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Right. Thank you very much.","Tony Alexander","Thanks Andy.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments at this time.","Mark Clark","Certainly, we like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and as always we certainly appreciate your support and interest in FirstEnergy. Thanks a lot.","Tony Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time.

First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Irene Prezelj","Thanks, Brenda. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website, along with the presentation which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session.","Before I turn the call over to Chuck, I\u2019ll note that we updated our investor materials with the goal of making it easier for you to find the information you need on our website. Our former consolidated report has been merged into our quarterly earnings package with additional materials provided in our fact book. As always, we welcome your feedback on these changes. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Jones","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We're off to a very good start in 2019. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share along with operating earnings of $0.67 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. Steve will discuss later our results reflect the continued success of our regulated growth strategies.","Let's begin with an update on our progress so far this year. In our transmission business, we're on pace to implement a plan to $1.2 billion investment in our Energizing the Future program in 2019. With most of that work in our ATSI and MAIT service territories in Ohio and Pennsylvania.","Just a reminder, energizing the future is a multi-year program to improve the reliability, resiliency and security of FirstEnergy\u2019s portion of the bulk electric system that is shared by our entire nation. It\u2019s working. Just one example is that we have reduced transmission outages due to equipment failures on our ATSI system during the first four years of the program by 37%. And while we are still finalizing year 5 [ph] results, it looks like that will increase to eliminating more than half of the equipment related outages in ATSI. We expect similar results in May as we move forward. We currently have about 1000 projects underway in stages ranging from engineering and project development to project management and construction.","Many of these are multi-year endeavors and we expect to bring 600 to 700 projects in service in 2019, which is consistent with our pace during the last several years of this customer focused initiative. To support our Energizing the Future initiative, this month we opened our center for advanced energy technology or Kate in Akron. This 88,000 square foot facility is one of the most comprehensive grid technology testing and training centers of its kind in the country. We designed it to be a centralized hands-on environment where our engineers and technicians can develop and evaluate new technologies and grid solutions and simulate a variety of real world conditions.","It also includes classroom space where we can train our workforce to safely use new equipment and processes as we upgrade, maintain and ensure the security of the grid. In addition to supporting our grid modernization program, Kate also creates opportunities for us to advance best practices across the industry. We hope to collaborate with peer utilities research institutes, research institutes and key stakeholders such as device manufacturers, who could potentially utilize our state of the art facility.","Turning to our distribution business, as we mentioned last quarter, our Ohio Utilities filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission in early February for a two-year extension to the distribution modernization rider.","Again, while we believe, we have a strong case to continue this rider I will remind you that it is not factored into our current earnings growth projections. Also in Ohio, our supplemental settlement regarding tax reform and grid modernization is pending with the PUCO. This proposed settlement addresses how customers will benefit from savings associated with federal tax reform and seeks approval for the initial phase of our grid modernization program with investments of $516 million over three years.","In New Jersey, we were very pleased to reach a settlement yesterday with the staff of the Board of Public Utilities, the division of Rate Council and the New Jersey large energy user\u2019s coalition for our infrastructure investment program.","Our JCP&L Reliability Plus program builds on the service enhancements we have made in our New Jersey footprint in recent years with an additional $97 million investment. Through this program, we plan to implement more than 1400 targeted projects to enhance the reliability and resiliency of overhead power lines, replace existing equipment with smart technology devices and expand the vegetation management program to reduce tree related outages.","On final approval from the BPU, the work will take place between June 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Once the projects are complete, customers will experience fewer sustained outages under normal conditions as well as a reduction in outage duration.","While there was a difference between our original IIP request and the settlement amount, we have plenty of opportunities to make those capital investments in other parts of our system, both in distribution and transmission. We will also contemplate filing a subsequent IIP in New Jersey, to continue our investments there beyond 2020.","In Maryland, the Public Service Commission issued a final order in our Potomac Edison rate case on March 22nd. The order fully resolved tax reform in Maryland, calls for a final bill credit to customers to return prior period tax savings and allows Potomac Edison to increase based distribution rates by $6.2 million net of tax reform, to invest in safety and reliability enhancements.","In addition, the Public Service Commission approved a four year Electric Distribution and infrastructure surcharge rider. That program will be used to recover incremental costs related to three reliability programs, which include installing more distribution, automation equipment, accelerating an underground cable replacement program, and utilizing new substation rate closers that can minimize the number of customers impacted by service interruptions.","Potomac Edison is required to file another distribution rate case at the end of the surcharge period. In January, the Public Service Commission also approved Potomac Edison\u2019s five year $12 million pilot program to install electrical vehicle charging stations in Maryland and offer rebates for charger installations.","As part of the program, Potomac Edison plans to install 59 public charging stations at locations across our Maryland service territory, including nine fast chargers, residential customers will be eligible for rebates for the installation of EV charging stations at their home and rebates will also -- will be available for charging stations installed at multi-family properties.","We're proud to support Maryland's efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, which is an important step for a cleaner, healthier, environment. We see projects like this as a natural fit for First Energy as we fulfill our mission to become a forward looking utility committed to making our customers lives brighter, the environment better, and our communities stronger.","Our environmental and social on government strategy is built on the pillars of our mission statement. In 2019, we are continuing our efforts to offer greater transparency and engagement with our ESG goals.","Late this year, we will produce a new corporate responsibility report to examine our efforts on issues as wide ranging as diversity inclusion, our environmental footprint, corporate governance and community support. This will complement our first climate report, which we published earlier this month.","The Climate Report looks at how our strategies as a fully regulated utility are aligned with the emerging technology trends that support a lower carbon future and examines the business risks associated with a carbon constrained economy.","It also reviews our significant progress towards the carbon dioxide reduction goal we announced in 2015. We pledged to reduce CO2 emissions from our generating fleet by at least 90% below 2005 levels by the year 2045.","At the end of 2018, we had already achieved a reduction of 62% with about three quarters of that reduction related to plant retirements. We expect to reach a CO2 reduction of 80% later this year well on our way to achieving our goal.","I want to express our experience with plant decommissioning activities. Over the past 12 years, we safely and responsibly retired and remediated seven coal plants, and successfully anticipated the economic and environmental concerns for each site. This is just one of the ways in which we have demonstrated our commitment to corporate responsibility. It is a core value that we stand by at all times and that includes during the FES bankruptcy.","That is why a key component of our settlement agreement was our substantial support for FES to both emerge from bankruptcy and meet any legacy and future obligations. This includes all environmental responsibilities that could occur when the plants are eventually retired.","Following the judge's decision on the FES bankruptcy earlier this month, FES committed to engage with the Department of Justice and other concerned parties. In light of the commitment by FES, our previous assessment of the obligations and the surety and funding that are already in place. We see no increase risk to removing the broad third party releases from the comprehensive settlement.","While these releases would have served to bring finality to First Energy's involvement with these legacy assets, removing their releases does not in our assessment and experience increase liabilities or obligations to our company. We are pleased that FES has submitted a revised disclosure statement and believe they will continue to work constructively with all parties to ensure both timely approval of their plan and their bankruptcy exit.","At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our 6 million customers with a commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility and implemented our regulated growth strategy.","We are affirming our 2019 full year operating earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.75 per fully diluted share including this year's DMR. In addition, we are introducing a second quarter operating earnings guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share and affirming our long term compound annual operating earnings growth projection of 68% from 2018 through 2021.","Thank you. Now turn the call over to Steve for a review of the first quarter and other financial developments.","Steve Strah","Good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today. As usual, I'll begin with a couple of reminders. First, reconciliations and others detailed information about the quarter are available on our Website in the strategic and financial highlights documents. Also, we continue to present operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis. This provides the best comparative view of our performance.","With that, let's take a look at our results. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.59 per share. Operating earnings were $0.67 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this is above the midpoint of our guidance.","In our distribution business, our results benefited from higher weather adjusted residential load, and lower interest expense related to debt refinancing. I'll spend more time on that topic in just a few minutes.","These factors were offset by higher depreciation expense related to our rate base. Total distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 with a slight increase on a weather adjusted basis. Heating degree days were close to normal for the quarter and comparable to the first quarter of 2018.","Residential sales were a bright spot for us this quarter. Sales increased about 1% on a natural basis when adjusted for weather, the increase was almost 3% with growth in both customer counts and average usage. The upturn in weather adjusted residential sales over the past 12 months is an encouraging sign.","In the commercial customer class, sales increased about 1.5% on national basis and about 1% when adjusted for weather. In our industrial class, load was flat, marking the end to a long 10 quarter run of growth in that segment. The results reflect lower demand from steel and automotive manufacturers, which offset growth, continued growth in the shale and chemical industries.","Turning to our transmission business, earnings increased as a result of higher rate base, which reflects our continued investment in the Energizing the Future initiative. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses at our stated rate transmission companies.","And finally, in our corporate segment, first quarter results reflected higher net financing costs in the absence of commodity margin from the Pleasants Power Station.","As a reminder, we began to exclude Pleasants from our operating earnings in mid-2018 due to the court approved settlement that transfers economic interests of the plan to FES. These factors were partially offset by a lower, effective tax rate.","Touching on underlying strengths of our distribution and transmission companies, we have recently seen positive, credit ratings actions for several of our subsidiaries. Near the end of March, Moody's issued one notch upgrades to ATSI, MAIT and JCP&L.","And last week, Fitch issued one notch upgrades to JCP&L, Manpower, Potomac Edison and Allegheny Energy generated company. We believe these positive actions are a testament to our overall improved risk profile and we expect to see continued positive momentum.","Before I close, I'll take a moment to review our financing activities this year. At our utilities, we refinanced $300 million of maturing debt at both JCP&L and MAIT during the quarter. We issued new senior notes totaling $900 million to re page or return borrowings and fund capital expenditures at these utilities. We also issued $500 million of new debt at First Energy Transmission and $100 million at ATSI, primarily to repay short term borrowings and fund continued investments in our Energizing the Future program.","Lastly, from a liquidity perspective, as of Friday April 19, we had approximately $3.7 billion of liquidity of which $200 million was cash.","Thank you for your time. We had a very solid quarter, and we're off to a great start this year. Now let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Q - Greg Gordon","Hey good morning guys. Good quarter. Thank you.","A - Chuck Jones","Hi Greg.","Q - Greg Gordon","Can you talk a little bit about the -- the settlement in New Jersey, I think, you guys had asked for approximately $400 million of Electric Infrastructure investment over four years. I think you settled on $100 million over two years. How did we get -- ask to the to the deal, and do you think that's adequate to provide the safe and reliable power to those customers and how does that proceed after that?","A - Chuck Jones","So first of all from our perspective, Greg we're very happy with this settlement. It's now the second time, we've been able to reach a settlement in New Jersey with the main parties that influence our ability to do our business over there. Very happy with the settlement. To put it in perspective, it's $97 million over an 18-month period, which begins in June of this year and ends at the end of 2020.","So just to give you a little perspective, where we talk in Ohio about $516 million over three years, let's double the number of customers. So if you have that, it's $258 million and it's double the number of years, three, versus one and a half. So if you have it again, it's $129 million. So we're spending $97 million in New Jersey versus $129 million in Ohio on an apples-to-apples basis. It's a good start, and we're very happy with it. And I believe if we execute to perfection, and we deliver the results that we intend to deliver in New Jersey, we won't have any problem negotiating an addition to this that goes beyond 2020.","Q - Greg Gordon","Great. Thanks for the perspective. Second question. When I -- when we look at the -- when we look at the new agreement that you've made to move forward with the get the disclosure statement that FES bankruptcy approved and get this thing done. What's the critical path now for the FES bankruptcy to be fully and completely resolved voted on, and for them to exit? Is it -- that we're waiting for the nuclear license transfers and -- or is it some other issue. And what's your best guess as to sort of the window of timing on when this is wrapped up?","A - Chuck Jones","Well with the caveat that I am not the CEO of FES and FEG, I would suggest that I think the nuclear license transfer is probably on the critical path. Now that we've kind of moved forward beyond the court ruling I believe, with regard to these nonconsensual third party releases. Let me just comment on that a little bit more. I would say that, that caught us by surprise with the focus of the court being solely on the releases and not on the actual settlement, because we believed in the actual settlement that we have provided substantial value to make sure that FES can emerge, operate these assets and deal with any retirement obligations when those come down the road.","So we felt like the nonconsensual releases weren't a big deal, because of the substantial settlement that was on the table. But since the focus is on those, we decided to remove those and move forward. So now the next step in the process is for the court to move or to approve the disclosure statements and allow the process to continue moving forward. We're hopeful that will happen on May 20th, and then and then they will continue to make their case for emergence and we expect that to happen sometime later this summer. And then the license transfers would be on the critical path if it -- if it all flows that way.","Q - Greg Gordon","Okay. So later this summer would be great, August or September. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","A - Chuck Jones","I think it's later in the year than that Greg. It\u2019s probably November, October November with the transfer.","Q - Greg Gordon","Got you. October, November. Thank you for being clear. Have a great day.","A - Chuck Jones","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumolin Smith with Bank of America.","Q - Julien Dumolin Smith","Hey good morning.","A - Chuck Jones","Hi, Julien","Q - Julien Dumolin Smith","Hey. Thank you for taking the question. So maybe just a start where Greg just left off. Might be a tad detailed, but just if you give us a little bit of sense, obviously you've posted a surety bond already specifically against some of the assets here and one of the larger collage assets. Can you talk about where that number came from just the firm it up in terms of. I know you said in your prepared remarks, this doesn't change the metrics as far as you see it. How did you come up with that surety bond number, and you how do you think about that relative to the obligation of that? Because obviously that came from somewhere. So I just want to try to be a little bit more confident out there.","A - Chuck Jones","Well. First of all those -- the surety bonds have been in place for quite a while now, all the way, way back to the beginning of our negotiations with FES and they arrived at given we have already begun the process for example, with Little Blue Run at the Mansfield plant of closing it in steps part by part every year. So we've got a good track record of what the cost to do that are, and the surety bond is was put in place to ensure that that their surety for those costs, should we at some point not decide to do it, but we're not going to do that. And I want to -- I want to say very clearly, what I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to stand behind any environmental commitment that we have if we sell a power plant. We're still in that chain of ownership at some point if the new owners would default.","But the other thing I want to say very clearly is we're not afraid of that, because we've shut down, retired, remediated, tore down and turned over sites in some cases for seven coal fired power plants already. The cost, the benefit that you get out of the scrap, steel, iron, copper, aluminum, the property value","For aluminum the property value et cetera, this is not any big deal for FirstEnergy. And so, we\u2019re to move forward fine. But as I said before I want to repeat, we provided substantial benefits to FES that they're going to have the ability to take care of this on their own.","Q - Julien Dumolin Smith","Excellent. Thanks for the clarity there. If I can briefly here on credit overall, obviously that\u2019s little bit tied to this process. How you think about that continued added latitude new metrics as it stands today given the timeline you just talked to Greg about as well if you don\u2019t mind?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, I think if you\u2019ve been watching we\u2019ve seen nothing but positive action out of the credit rating agencies, positive action in particular down at some of our utility levels. But I don't expect that that\u2019s going to change going forward. I think we were in constant communication with the rating agencies. They know we\u2019re at in this process. When we had the little speed bump with the bankruptcy court, we communicated with them and I don't see anything that\u2019s going to affect it on the downside. As we emerge and as we get this process completely behind us, I think we can make a case that we\u2019re a much less risky company and that \u2013 we got to be able to move forward all in a very positive direction.","Q - Julien Dumolin Smith","Do you think it\u2019s more than a percent or so versus the debt latitude as it stands today?","A - Steve Staub","Yes. Julien, and this is Steve. At the end of day the rating agencies are viewing this year as a year of the transition for us, okay? So upon emergence for FES will be responsible for putting forward the $225 million payment and issuing the tax note of $628 million for 2022. So, I think they understand it\u2019s transitional. Once again, we believe that the beyond that we\u2019ll be at our 12% FFO to debt ratio going forward and as the expectation we have going forward. We don\u2019t see those base line expectations changing.","As Chuck said, we\u2019re working very closely with all three agencies to ensure, they\u2019re fully aware of where we\u2019re at. All the positive movements have been great so far. We want them to do their jobs and further consider. And I know they are cognizant that our risk profile is lowering at every point in this processes as FES gets through their bankruptcy.","Q - Julien Dumolin Smith","Excellent. I\u2019ll leave there. Thank you very much.","A - Steve Staub","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Q - Jonathan Arnold","Good morning. And I think couple of my questions were just asked, but I\u2019d like just on the FES and the release change. Is there any accounting implication of that? Any AROs that you\u2019d have to recognize that you wouldn't have had to recognize with the releases, just wanted to just tie up any loose end there?","A - Chuck Jones","I\u2019m sitting here watching my chief accountant said \u2013 say, no.","Q - Jonathan Arnold","It\u2019s good to hear, Chuck. Thank you. That was it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Q - Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","A - Chuck Jones","Good morning.","Q - Praful Mehta","So, unfortunately I will also ask a little bit on this FES and the environmental side. If you could \u2013 could you dimension for us and given all the experience you\u2019ve had and clearly the risk seems low here and you clearly help FES kind of stand on their own in terms of the remediation, but just to understand what is the risk, like if there is a look back period on the environmental side, how -- what are the factors that could kind of increase the liability from an FES perspective that could slow-up to FE, if you had to kind of look at worst-case scenarios, what are the scenarios that we should be thinking about in that case?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, I think it\u2019s pretty simple actually, Praful. FES would have to go bankrupt the second time without having dealt with these environmental legacy issues that would then if they fall to FirstEnergy we will deal with them. But as I said earlier, we\u2019ve got already experienced with what that means from an economic perspective and from an environmental perspective to take these plants down, return the land to a greenfield status and move forward and get it certified that way by the State EPAs that have jurisdiction over these sites. So there's just not that much risk.","The value of the scrap and the value of the property offset and there's a cottage industry that has developed as a result of the number of power plants closing around this country to take these plans off their hands. They\u2019re actually offer to pay you in some cases for the opportunity to deal with this legacy issue on your behalf, so it's just not something we\u2019re concerned about.","Q - Praful Mehta","Got you. Again, very helpful color. But just to clarify, how good can that environmental cost be, like \u2013 is there coal ash? If they were like what can that number be before you get to the remediation and then obviously this scrap benefits. But is there a ballpark number that we can think about as a potential liability if FES does go bankrupt the second time?","A - Chuck Jones","With regard to any coal ash liabilities, the surety bonds that are in place already protect us on that front. So there aren\u2019t any beyond that they we\u2019re worried about. And as I said, the economics are such that there\u2019s nothing there that I\u2019m worried about in terms of ongoing financial obligations to our company that of what you get out of the scrap and the property.","Q - Praful Mehta","Got you. Again, super helpful color. Maybe a final question just on the DMR. In terms of timing of a decision is there any clarity on when a decision will come on the potential extension of the DMR?","A - Chuck Jones","No timing. We\u2019ve ask for them to get moving and potentially you have hearings as early as August. Obviously, the existing DMR expires at the end of this year. So we would push hard for any answer sometime this year. So, we know what the impacts going to be next year.","Q - Praful Mehta","Understood. Again thank you so much.","A - Chuck Jones","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s actually James on behalf of Shar.","A - Chuck Jones","Okay. Hi, James, how are you?","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Good. I just had a quick follow-on question to Greg\u2019s question regarding New Jersey. I know you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you\u2019ve had conversations regarding EVM's restructure? And then we also just saw one of your neighbors propose a very large EE program. And I was wondering if we did see anything on either of these fronts in the near term? And then, would that be an addition to a 2021 IIP or is the bandwidth kind of limited there?","A - Chuck Jones","I don\u2019t think there's anything ongoing there right now, James. We were focused on getting a settlement on the IIP through 2020. And what we plan to spend that $97 million on does not include anything to do with EV or it's what I said in my remarks. It\u2019s improving the real-time reliability to customers. And beyond that what we plan, what we would look at beyond 2020 we haven't even started to focus on that yet.","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So, no conversations really on the EV at this point?","A - Chuck Jones","Not really.","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Q - Chris Turnure","Good morning. I had another follow up on the New Jersey settlement. Could you give us a sense as to your regulatory strategy going forward there? You mentioned filing another IIP in a year or two. Why would you maybe choose that route versus going in for a full general rate case, given I think you are under earning in the state?","A - Chuck Jones","Let me just summarize our regulatory strategy overall, because I think it's the same everywhere. When we believe it's time for another base rate case, we will have a base rate case and that's whether it's New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, our rates are frozen for at least five more years. So \u2013 but we would have base rate case whenever that makes more sense than using the IIP or using the DISC in Pennsylvania. We\u2019re going to look at that and evaluate it at all times. I don't see any meaningful base rate cases in 2019. And then, we\u2019ll evaluate and we\u2019ll let you know what we see is the plan for 2020 when we get out to 2020.","Q - Chris Turnure","Okay. But for now the kind of earned ROE trajectory there, plus your earnings from this settlement and the investment that comes from that are sufficient in your view?","A - Chuck Jones","Yes.","Q - Chris Turnure","Okay. And then my second question is on holdco financing strategy. I think on the last call you said the holding company would be around 35% to 37% of consolidated debt this year. Can you just give us some flavor as to that amount? How much of it is kind of long-term debt, short-term debt, term loans? And how much of that separately might be variable rates?","A - Chuck Jones","Yes. I'll let Steve Staub to answer that in detail. But I would just say, it's -- that's the level we're going to be at for the foreseeable future. And I continue to believe that as we get more financial flexibility as a company we're better off investing and serving our customers better and indirectly creating growth for our shareholders as opposed to retiring this debt. It's better and makes more economic sense I think for everyone involved. But I'll let Steve take you through the details of what constitutes that corporate debt.","A - Steve Staub","Sure. So, in terms of the composition of our holding company debt at FE Corp., we have 1.750 billion [ph] in term loans. That's our most cost effective debt on an after tax basis that's right around 2.5%. Then we have 5.35 billion in bonds that on an after tax basis is anywhere from 3% to 3.5%. And then, we have the $628 million tax note yet to be issued once FES emerges we will issue that note and that will be outstanding until the end of 2022.","In terms of financing activity, I suspect that at some point in time over the next 12 months we will most likely go out into the bond markets and refinance the term loan position and potentially do some liability management on some of the bonds mature in 2022 and 2023. So you could see a sizable bond deal at some point in time with FE Corp over the next let's say 12 months. And as Chuck said, our holding company debt is going to be around the mid 30s, 35% to 37% for the foreseeable future and that's where we're going to be.","Q - Chris Turnure","Okay. That's helpful. And fixed versus variable rate is kind of embedded within that answer with the term loans being the variable component?","A - Steve Staub","That is correct. The term loans are the only variable debt that we have.","Q - Chris Turnure","Okay. Thank you, guys for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Q - Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Thanks for the taking my question. And congrats on a good start to the year. I have two, both a little bit on the regulatory side, obviously at the distribution business. First of all West Virginia, how are you thinking, Chuck, about a multi-year goal in terms of potential rate base growth reemerging or reigniting in West Virginia in the coming years? Meaning, how do you think about what the opportunity set for investment in that state is? That's my first question.","My second question is about Pennsylvania. If I look at the data on your slide 31 in the fact book you guys put out last night. Some of the subsidiaries earnings, I don't know, trailing 12 months 2018, south of 8% or 7.5% earned ROEs. Just curious why -- I think three of them were below that. Why that wouldn't stimulate potential rate case filings in the coming months there?","A - Chuck Jones","All right. Well, first of all, thank you for asking regulated questions. It's nice to be able to answer those instead of FES questions. But with West Virginia, here's what I say, we don't have any long term strategy for West Virginia. We had in place a tree trimming strategy in particular because we had a number of storms dating back to the derecho back in 2013. I think that was -- that that show that we had some exposure there. But beyond that West Virginia is kind of a state that we're in a business as usual mode. We\u2019re we're spending money every year.","We're seeing some growth in West Virginia as a result of being a fully regulated state. Industrial growth in the shale and chemical sector and as well as in the north eastern part of West Virginia and our Potomac Edison West Virginia territory, we're seeing some growth. That's offsetting our costs. When we get to the point there where we think we need to have a rate case, we'll have a rate case. But right now, we just don't see any need to and I don't have any long term strategy because I think we're performing okay and there's nothing that needs immediate attention in West Virginia.","With regard to Pennsylvania, we've made a concerted effort to improve our disclosures and I think that means you all are going to be talking to Irene quite a bit. But I don't think we want to get into details about rates of return and so forth on this call. So I'm just going to encourage you to talk with her off line about it. But I will point out that in Pennsylvania as of the first of this year the DISC is turned on in all four of our operating companies in Pennsylvania. We cannot turn that DISC on unless we're underneath the threshold for allowed rate of return as the commission looks at it. So I think we're in good shape. We're using the DISC at all four companies and I think we ought to take it off line to talk about the details, because as we get more and more transparent it's going to create a lot of questions that we just don't have time for on an earnings call.","Q - Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Chuck.","A - Chuck Jones","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil.","Q - Andrew Weisel","Good morning everyone. Chuck, [Indiscernible] I was going to congratulate you guys and the IRR team in particular for the new slide deck. I like the look of it. Two questions for you guys though both regulated, so don't worry about that. First one is, I know you haven't updated the CapEx outlook in a little while, but given the DPM and JCP&L Reliability Plus settlements, should we expect results to trend towards the higher end of the ranges? Or is it more a function of improved visibility into recovery with less or no lag?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, I think in what we\u2019ve said as far as our going forward 6% to 8% growth plan, we've said that the CapEx program in general is going to be in the $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion range combined T&D throughout that planning period and I expect it continues to keep it in that range. That range contemplated. The IIP in New Jersey had contemplated where we were at with the grid mod in Ohio. And we provided a range there to allow for some movement in all of what we do. You can't plan down to the dollar -- $2.9 billion of capital spend. But I think you can count on it being in that range throughout the planning period and probably likely beyond the planning period.","Q - Andrew Weisel","Should I take that as a no comment on high end versus middle versus low end?","A - Chuck Jones","There's so much that moves around that it's going to be what it will be. We have capital costs related to storms that we expect to be able to cover within that range. If we have a heavy storm here, I'll move us to the high end. And if we have a light storm here it will -- there's just so much that moves around that I'm not trying to dodge your question. I just don't know the answer to your question and that's why we\u2019ll provide a range.","Q - Andrew Weisel","Okay. Understood and fair enough. Next one I have is a little bit different direction than some of these other questions. Three of your largest states are at least contemplating some sort of ZEC programs for nukes. I know you don't have any plans for rate cases in the near term as you talked about. But do you worry about affordability impacts on rates on these programs? And how do you balance the tradeoff of reliability versus cost especially now that you're out of the generation business?","A - Chuck Jones","I don't worry about it at all because I think these states that are stepping up to protect their nuclear plants are ensuring long term rate stability for their residence and their customers in those states, and it's providing a hedge against the most high beta fuel that we've ever had in this industry which is natural gas. It's providing a surety that they have ample supplies of electricity during the most strained times of year in frigid climates where natural gas cannot meet all of its obligations.","So, I think it's providing and just take for example, the bill that's pending here in Ohio. It's $2.50 per month on a residential customer bill. To provide that security we all buy insurance for our homes, our cars and a lot of other things. It's a very cost effective insurance policy that these states are taking out and it provides long term economic benefit and clean air benefits too. So, I think these states are smart and I'm on record and I'll continue to say as long as I have. I have this role.","These states are making up for failed market policies that are not working correctly. When you form a market on nothing but a lease cost, marginal cost, it's not going to ever take care of the fixed costs of these important assets. So I think the states are all doing the right things.","Q - Andrew Weisel","That's very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Agnie Storozynski with Macquarie Group.","Q - Agnie Storozynski","Thank you. I will go back to FES. So just taking a step back, I understand whole of the explanation about the limited \u2013 as any liabilities, but you did try to have this release included in the FES Settlement. So there must have been a reason why you wanted to have it there. So, if you'd never thought that there is a risk why did you have it in the settlement?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, Angie, I said in my prepared remarks, it was in there to try to create some finality which is I think important in everybody's minds as FES exits that is much finality as we could create we created. And that's why it was in there. Never expecting it to be the focus that it became during the bankruptcy process and the focus it became with the Justice Department. So, we believed that it could be in there because the substantial settlement that we've worked out with FES provides for taking care of these obligations over the long term and provides for their ability to exit, operate and then eventually deal with any plant closure costs that come their way. So we just didn't see it as a big deal one way or another, but it was in there to try to provide finality. And -- but once it became a speed bump we have no issue with removing it.","Q - Agnie Storozynski","Okay. And then on Ohio DMR, so, I mean is there -- are you engaged in negotiations? Is there any range of possibilities that you would consider. I mean, what is the pitch at this point in the sense, are you're trying to say that your investment level in Ohio will increase commensurate, so that\u2019s basically humping 33 million in extended DMR. I mean, what can you give us here? What\u2019s the bid and ask spread is currently?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, as I've said, we have nothing built into our forecast going forward for DMR. We've asked for the current level to be extended for two years which is what the original filing gave us the ability to do the bid ask and I guess its anywhere from zero to the current levels. Our approach is that it has driven what the commission was trying to do, which is stimulated investment in our Ohio utilities in grid modernization efforts that will hopefully then be built upon with approval of our grid modernization program once the commission gets back to a full business schedule. Unfortunately, we had a change in chairs and it's taking a while for them to get the train back on the tracks and moving forward there. But I expect we'll get approval of the grid mod program and build upon it. So the basic premise for why we are saying it should be extended is to continue to stimulate the things that the commission was trying to do in the first place.","Q - Agnie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","A - Chuck Jones","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research.","Q - Charles Fishman","Good morning. Transmission; memory serves me that MAIT and ATSI, a few years back you agreed to a lower ROE in exchange for going forward rate making framework because of the hundreds of small projects you had and then obviously in hindsight appears to be the right decision based on the earnings growth there. But with all that -- with the discussion going on in FERC, the ROE review. Because you're already at a lower ROE relative to some other systems around the country, is that something that really we shouldn't even be concerned about that just not going to impact you?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, first, we agreed to make that change with ATSI, ATSI was at a higher rate of return on a lagging formula rate which as you said meant that a project they got done in January of 2019, we wouldn't start earning on until June of 2020 under that old. So now when that project goes in a forward looking formula rate, return to cash and earnings to the business much quicker. So the lower rate of return made sense for ATSI. When we founded MAIT, we founded MAIT from the beginning on a forward looking formula rate with a 10.38% return and MAIT it\u2019s not that old. So I think it was set very recently.","I don't think there\u2019s anything that we\u2019re worried about with regard to earned rate of returns in our transmission businesses. So I don't think there should be anything that you are worried about. And my read of the [Indiscernible] or what it's worth at the FERC is while they\u2019re looking at rates of return they\u2019re looking at in ways to continue to incent investment in this grid across this entire country, not ways to disincent. So I just don't think it's something that we should be concerned about.","Q - Charles Fishman","I realize your CapEx goes out to just 2021, are you even thinking about an energizing the Future Phase 3?","A - Chuck Jones","Well, I think I\u2019ve said before, we have $20 billion of transmission projects that our team has already identified that they believe need to be done. And so given that need, I would expect it it's going to continue to be something we focus on for the foreseeable future. So, while I\u2019m not telling you what our CapEx plan is. I think my expectations it\u2019s going to be in that range for quite some time.","Q - Charles Fishman","Okay. Like your new slide deck. Thank you. That\u2019s it.","A - Chuck Jones","Okay. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Chuck Jones","All right. Well, I don\u2019t see any more questions in the queue here. So, I want to thank you all for your time today. And thank you for your continued support of FirstEnergy, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Beringer","Thank you, and good afternoon. During this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the business of FirstEnergy Corp. are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Please read the Safe Harbor statement contained in the consolidated report to the financial community, which was released earlier today and is also available on our website under the Earnings Release link.","Reconciliations to GAAP for the non-GAAP earnings measures we will be referring to today are also contained in that report, as well as on the Investor Information section on our website at www.firstenergycorp.com\/ir.","Participating in today's call are Tony Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Jim Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Donny Schneider, President of FirstEnergy Solutions; Harvey Wagner, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","I'll now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony J. Alexander","Thanks, Meghan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide a general overview of last year's results and accomplishments before moving to some of our key areas of focus for 2013. Leila will join us for a brief regulatory overview. And finally, Jim will join the call for the first time in his new capacity as CFO. Jim will take a look back at the fourth quarter and full year 2012 and provide a preview of our 2013 financial objectives. I'm sure most of you already know Jim from his tenure as Treasurer, so expect this transition to be quite smooth. And of course, Mark Clark remains involved in key company projects in his new role as Executive Vice President of Finance and Strategy.","I would also like to take a moment here to thank Harvey Wagner for his exceptional guidance and oversight as our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. And I wish him best in his upcoming retirement.","Okay. Let's get started. Today, we announced full year non-GAAP earnings of $3.34 per share, in line with our guidance. Despite the absence of a meaningful rebound in the regional economy and energy markets, we accomplished much in 2012, and I'll start by walking through some of the highlights.","First, we maintained our dividend, which is supported by the solid and stable returns from our regulated distribution and transmission business segments, and we maintained our credit ratings through very challenging economic conditions. Our competitive strategy at FirstEnergy Solutions continues to produce significant growth. FES now serves 2.6 million retail customers, which is an increase of 42% compared to the end of 2011. And FES grew direct retail sales by 18% during the year.","Our nuclear fleet achieved strong safety and operational performance. This includes the industry's lowest worker dose exposure at our Beaver Valley units and our best-ever fleet forced loss rates. Forced loss rates were industry top decile at Beaver Valley Unit 1 and top quartile at Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Davis-Besse.","At our fossil fleet, we deactivated units at 7 of our older coal-fired plants in response to MATS and other environmental regulations that made these plants even less likely to be dispatched. We also plan to deactivate several additional units in early 2015 at the conclusion of Reliability Must Run arrangements. At our remaining fossil units, we have taken an aggressive look at the capital investment required to comply with these environmental standards. After a rigorous analysis of the necessary environmental controls, we have reduced our projected spend to $200 -- to $975 million, down from an original estimate of $2 billion to $3 billion. We also took proactive measures to implement more efficient fuel and dispatch strategies, trim maintenance costs, enhance operational flexibility and reorganize certain areas of business to ensure more appropriate staffing levels and reduced costs in light of the economy.","On the regulatory front, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved our electric security plan. This new ESP, which takes us through May 31, 2016, is essentially an extension of our existing plan. Our ESP has been widely considered a success in terms of its ability to produce competitively priced electricity for customers who remain with the utility for generation service, as well as creating a level playing field among suppliers competing to serve customers who choose to shop.","On the financial side, we made a $600 million contribution to the pension plan in early 2012 and pursued an early buyout of the Bruce Mansfield sale leasebacks taking future obligations off the table.","And finally, today marks the 2 years since we closed our merger with Allegheny. We remain very pleased with this combination. It has produced cost savings and increased our operating flexibility while also expanding our pool of leadership talent. I'm very proud of these achievements. Our focus on our 3 core business segments, generation, distribution and transmission, offers greater flexibility and more growth opportunities and financial stability than any one business could provide on a stand-alone basis. And our strategy remains unchanged. We are prepared to meet the economic and regulatory challenges of 2013 while positioning our company for long-term growth. Our plan includes a focus on controlling costs, continuing to improve our operational performance and exploring opportunities to grow our regulated and competitive businesses.","I'll discuss these opportunities in more detail starting with utilities where we are working to promote growth on several fronts. For example, we have joined an industry electrification effort that is offering electric power at truck stops as an alternative to running diesel engines overnight. This is a particularly attractive alternatives in areas that are not meeting Clean Air Act quality standards.","We are also very active in economic development efforts related to the Utica and Marcellus Shale boom in and near our Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio service territories. This includes initiatives like building a new Black River Substation that is about to go on online in Lorain, Ohio. Our facility will support a major steel manufacturer that is expanding in response to the growth of the natural gas industry.","In our transmission business, we expect our investments within the FirstEnergy footprint to continue providing growth and stable returns. In 2012, we consolidated ATSI and TrAIL under a large stand-alone transmission subsidiary holding company and put in place $1 billion credit facility. We also formulated a long-term plan for the ATSI region that includes a significant number of projects designed to support reliability in the Northern Ohio area primarily in response to the plant deactivations brought on by MATS and other environmental regulations.","On a related note, we continue moving forward with American Municipal Power on the potential project announced in November to develop peaking capacity at our Eastlake plant near Cleveland. This project, which is subject to, among other things, regulatory approval, could reduce our need for some of the previously announced transmission projects and extend the time frame for others.","Finally, we're also building a new transmission control center in the Akron area that will include advanced technology to enhance service reliability across our entire footprint.","Turning now to FirstEnergy Solutions, our focus remains on expanding our retail business and strengthening our brand among customers in both new and existing targeted markets. Governmental aggregation is an area where we've had tremendous success, and it will remain a priority in 2013. Last year, FirstEnergy Solutions signed contracts with 160 communities, including more than 100 in Illinois. Today, FES serves this sales channel with more than 17-million-megawatt hours, a 10% increase over 2011, and we continue to see potential for more growth in both Ohio -- in both in Southern Ohio and Illinois. We project annual FES sales growth of about 3% to 5% over the next few years. In 2013, we expect continued benefits from our strategy of first mover advantage and shifting megawatt hours between sales channels, as we remain focused on both volume and margin.","As you've heard us say over the years, we operate in many ways like a traditional utility but without the geographic restrictions. By design, our customer portfolio continues to look a lot like that of a Midwestern utility. That's the type of load our plants were originally built to serve, and we continue to leverage our generation assets selling the power that we produce to our end-use retail customers.","But our approach is much different from others in the electric retail market space. We have fully implemented a multi-channel sales approach, which means we go deep and wide in the territories we target. We strongly believe that this approach is far less risky and more profitable than simply focusing on one segment of the market, and it's allowing us to significantly grow our customer base in a cost-effective fashion, while also taking advantage of opportunities to increase our profitability. In addition, our balanced portfolio provides greater stability over the long term and diversifies our risk, and our integrated asset-backed strategy offers flexibility, as we work to reduce costs and maximize margins.","Finally, as our competitive sales continue to grow over time and markets begin to improve, we plan to reinvest or revisit our fleet investment strategy that we call \"mining our assets\". This approach focuses on improving efficiencies, lowering forced loss rates and upgrading equipment at existing plants as markets justify instead of making investments in costly new generation. In the past, this successful strategy allowed us to add more than 600 megawatts of capacity with far less risk and at a fraction of the cost of building a new plant.","The \"mining our asset\" approach provides an incremental platform for our generation capabilities to support sales growth. We will take a very competitive-minded approach to these investments, spending capital on improvements only after sales have been committed to support them. In doing so, we expect the timing of these investments to be linked closely to the growth of our retail business.","These plans represent short- and long-term examples of how we are managing our business for the current market conditions while preparing for the eventual economic improvement. As more generating units are deactivated due to environmental regulations and natural gas and power prices rise, we would expect an improved supply-demand balance, and at that point, the groundwork we are laying today should help accelerate our growth.","We have a strong track record of delivering on our plans, and that is how we are approaching 2013. We expect this to be a year of executing on our strategies and implementing the plans we have described. And we believe this approach will result in an even stronger company that is well positioned for the future.","Now I'll turn it over to Leila for a look at our regulatory priorities for 2013. Leila?","Leila L. Vespoli","Thanks, Tony. We have a full plate of regulatory and legislative issues before us this year with significant activity in 4 states. I'll go through the agenda state by state starting with Pennsylvania.","In December, we filed a smart meter deployment plan with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or PUC. Hearings have been scheduled for May, and I would anticipate final approval by September. The plan calls for deployment over the period 2013 through 2019 with an estimated cost of the completion of about $1.25 billion. Cost recovery is expected to occur through the existing smart meter technology surcharge. We also filed a change to our default service supply plan in Pennsylvania, which shifted procurement to 2 auctions per year from 4. The second 2013 auction was completed on February 12. FirstEnergy Solutions participated and won 24 out of 75 tranches. In response to the PUC's guidance in its retail market investigation, last year, we adopted elements of the PUC's earlier recommendations in our default service plan for the period June 2013 through May 2015. We will continue working with the PUC and other stakeholders to promote a fair and robust competitive market.","A retail market investigation has also been launched by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. While we do not anticipate significant changes to the Ohio market rule, we share the commission's objective to expand retail competition throughout Ohio. Currently, 77% of our Ohio utility load has selected an alternative supplier, and Ohio competitive markets have developed well despite being hindered by some lingering subsidies. A 3-year auction for generation supply for our Ohio utility customers was conducted on January 22, resulting in a price of $59.17 per megawatt hour. FirstEnergy Solutions participated and won 5 of the 17 tranches available for bid, very much consistent with FES' business plan. The next auction is scheduled for October 2013.","Also in Ohio, we have an active case with respect to an audit of the alternative energy rider, which recovers costs associated with procurement of renewable energy credit. As you recall, our Ohio utilities purchased these RECs at market prices in 2009 through 2010 to comply with the state's alternative energy law. Now certain parties have suggested that we should have rejected available RECs and instead either paid a penalty or otherwise petitioned the commission for relief. However, Ohio law does not give the commission the authority to relieve us from our statutory requirement when RECs are available. We will continue to participate in these proceedings, which include a public hearing that commenced on February 19 with a decision expected late second or early third quarter. As of July 31, 2013, we will have collected all but $4.9 million of the costs at issue.","I'll take a moment here to discuss Hurricane Sandy, which affected practically our entire service area. The total costs associated with restoring service and rebuilding damaged part of our system in 5 states is approximately $860 million. A state-by-state breakdown of the capital, expense and cost deferral is available on the consolidated report to the financial community, which was posted to our website this morning.","In New Jersey, where the damage from Hurricane Sandy was the most devastating, our costs were about $630 million. As you know, we filed a base rate case for JCP&L in November as required by the New Jersey Board of Public Utility. On February 22, we amended the case to include $603 million of the distribution costs relating to Hurricane Sandy, including approximately $345 million for capital expenditures incurred while restoring service, as well as $258 million in deferred expenses that we propose to recover over a 6-year period. Despite the massive damage and spending on restoring power to JCP&L customers after this historic storm, the impact on our customer rates is still in the single digit. And JCP&L's rates remained the lowest among New Jersey utilities regulated by the BPU.","Let's look now at West Virginia. The proposed transaction to transfer full ownership of the Harrison plant to our Mon Power subsidiary is important both for the state and the company. We discussed last quarter this transfer is a part of a resource plan to address the capacity shortfall related to the deactivation of more than 600 megawatts of older regulated generating capacity due to environmental regulation. It is expected to help ensure reliable power for our Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia for many years to come. The Harrison facility is equipped with modern emission control, and it produces electricity with coal mined in the state. We believe that this transaction is very positive for the economy of West Virginia. Under the proposed terms, Mon Power would acquire the remaining 80% of the Harrison plant, giving the utility sole ownership of the 1,984-megawatt facility. In addition, Mon Power would sell its 8% minority interest or about 100 megawatts in the Pleasants Power Station to Allegheny Energy Supply. The proposed asset transfer requires approval of the West Virginia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We are well along on the discovery process, and the West Virginia Coal Association and the IBEW have gone on record with the PUC in support of the transaction. Earlier this month, we received  the procedural schedule to set hearings in the case from May 29 through May 31.","Finally, we have announced that the temporary surcharge that will be used to recover transaction-related expenses once the transfer is approved will have a price tag of less than $1 per month for typical residential customers compared to the prices they were paying in 2012. Mon Power and Potomac Edison have also agreed to fund the base rate case no later than 6 months after the transaction closes to help define the end of that surcharge. We would expect that rate case proceeding to take about 12 months to complete.","Thank you for your time. Now I will hand the call over to Jim for a review of the fourth quarter results and our 2013 financial objectives.","James F. Pearson","Thank you, Leila. I'm pleased to be here today. I have enjoyed getting to know many of you over the past several years, and I look forward to meeting many of you on my new role. Today, I will review the fourth quarter and full year 2012 results, then close with a discussion of our 2013 financial plan. Before I move on to our 2012 results, I want to reaffirm our non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2013 of $2.85 to $3.15 per share.","Let's turn now to the consolidated report, as I walk through our results. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2012, non-GAAP earnings were $0.80 per share, while GAAP results were a loss of $0.35 per share. As I would discuss in a moment, our fourth quarter and full year GAAP results were significantly impacted by pension accounting. In the fourth quarter of 2011, non-GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share, while GAAP earnings were $0.23 per share. For the year, our non-GAAP earnings are $3.34 per share. And as Tony said, that is in line with our 2012 guidance. Full year 2012 GAAP earnings are $1.85 per share. These results compare to 2011 non-GAAP earnings of $3.64 per share and GAAP earnings of $2.22 per share. On Pages 4 and 20 of the consolidated report, you can find the list of special items that make up the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP results.","As I mentioned, the largest of these special items is the mark-to-market adjustment for pension and OPEB accounting, which was a negative $0.91 per share in the fourth quarter primarily related to a reduction in the discount rate. As you may recall, last year, we adopted a change in accounting where we will annually recognize any adjustments from deviations in actuarial assumptions in year incurred versus amortizing them over a number of years. In 2011, this adjustment was $0.74 per share, but it was more than offset by a onetime gain from the sale of non-core assets.","Other special items for the fourth quarter 2012 include plant deactivation cost, which decreased GAAP earnings by $0.12 per share; a decrease of $0.04 per share from impacts of the sale or impairment of non-core assets; other mark-to-market gains of $0.03 per share; a decrease of $0.03 per share related to merger accounting for commodity contracts and $0.02 per share in merger-related cost; a decrease of $0.02 per share related to tax legislative changes, regulatory charges of $0.02 per share, trust securities impairment of a $0.01 per share and a charge of $0.01 per share for restructuring costs.","Moving now to the drivers of our ongoing results. Clearly, Hurricane Sandy had a significant impact on our company during the quarter. Approximately 10,000 employees from across the company were dedicated to storm restoration efforts from late October through mid-November, redeploying them to capital work instead of O&M. Regulated distribution O&M expense, net of storm deferrals, decreased in the quarter as a result of this mass redeployment of the workforce. O&M also benefited from lower expenses related to our fossil and nuclear plants, as well as the coal units we deactivated in the third quarter. These items, in total, increased earnings by $0.08 per share.","Let's turn now to distribution deliveries, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Overall deliveries increased 252,000 megawatt hours or about 1%. Commercial deliveries were essentially flat, while industrial deliveries were down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 largely due to reduced operations by many of our large steel, automotive and refinery customers. Residential deliveries increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter influenced by colder weather versus the same period in 2011.","With regard to economic recovery in our service territory, we still have a ways to go. Full year 2012 sales adjusted for weather show that residential volumes are now on par with the levels we experienced in 2007. However, commercial sales remain down 5% and industrial sales are still 8% below prerecession levels. Further, while industrial sales have improved versus their 2009 low point, they have been basically stagnant for the past 3 years.","Moving back to the fourth quarter drivers. 2012 earnings also benefited by a total of $0.04 per share primarily as a result of investment income as we rebalanced our nuclear decommissioning trust portfolio and general taxes. Commodity margin reduced earnings by $0.08 per share in the quarter. Looking at commodity margin from a high level, the execution of our retail strategy resulted in a sales gain of $0.11 per share, but this was offset by $0.19 per share decrease in capacity revenues due to lower capacity prices. It should be noted that capacity prices and PJM during the June 2012 through May 2013 and June 2013 through May 2014 planning years are at historic lows in the range of $16 to $28 per megawatt day primarily as a result of auctions in the 2009 and 2010 periods that were at the depths of our recession. Further, the June 2014 through May 2016 planning years, as a result of auctions conducted in 2011 and 2012, prices are substantially higher in the $100-plus per megawatt day range.","On a more granular scale, overall contract sales increased 10% or $0.07 per share. And once again, the volume gains in contract sales offset the impact of lower market prices. Governmental aggregation sales increased 29% in the quarter driven primarily by new contracts in Illinois. Mass market sales rose 72% with much of that growth in Pennsylvania. And sales to large commercial and industrial customers increased 6%, as new customers in Southern Ohio offset lower use by some of our large commercial customers in our Ohio and Pennsylvania utility service territory. Finally, POLR sales continue to decrease, consistent with our retail strategy to realign our sales portfolio.","I'll mention here that FirstEnergy Solution's hedge position for the balance of 2013 is currently at 96%. Commodity margin in the fourth quarter also benefited from lower capacity expense, lower fuel expense related to increased nuclear output in the generation mix and gains from net financial sales and purchases. These were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues as I mentioned earlier, a decrease in wholesale sales due to higher contract sales and lower generation output, higher purchased power costs mainly related to having Sammis temporarily offline and serving more customers, higher transmission expense and lower sales of renewable energy credits.","While 2012 commodity margin was negatively impacted by lower capacity revenues at a lower average rate of 56 per megawatt hour, we are pleased with the progress that FirstEnergy Solutions is making. We ended the year with 100 million megawatt hours in competitive sales, a 10% increase compared to 2011. And we grew our retail customer base by 42% through the continued success of our multi-channel strategy.","Respecting our 2012 financial plan, we funded the Bruce Mansfield sale leaseback repurchase and took out additional nuclear sale leasebacks. We also contributed $600 million to the pension fund, putting the pension plan in the position to be fully funded once the discount rate returns to more historic levels, for example, like those adopted by Congress for determining funding obligations. And while we remain generally on track to achieve our overall goals, the cash requirements from the ratio and Hurricane Sandy put some additional pressure on our balance sheet.","Looking now at 2013. Our financial plan is structured to improve the balance sheet, enhance liquidity and maintain investment-grade credit metrics. The plan initially focuses on reducing debt at our competitive companies, primarily FES and Allegheny Supply, by at least $1.5 billion. The proceeds of the Harrison-Pleasants transaction in West Virginia combined with asset sales are expected to be sufficient to fund the debt reduction. The assets we intend to sell are primarily our competitive hydro fleet, which includes nearly 1,180 megawatts that were initially in our plans to be sold in 2015.","We're expecting to retire a combination of both tax-exempts bonds and taxable debt to achieve these debt reductions. While we have not looked to target taxable debt in recent years, it is now on our list of potential actions, as we weigh the redemption costs against the benefits of future interest savings from the current low-interest environment.","On the liquidity front, we are also working to refinance short-term borrowings with long-term debt as appropriate at our utilities and possibly at the corporate level. This refinancing activity would term out some of our revolver borrowings and again, take advantage of today's historically low interest rates to position ourselves for the future. We're also working with our banks to extend the maturity of existing credit facilities totaling $5.5 billion for an additional year to 2018. We believe this is a comprehensive plan that moves us where we would like to be in terms of our credit metrics and once completed, would significantly improve the balance sheet, especially at our competitive operations.","As Tony outlined, we are focused on growth across each of our businesses, including investments in new transmission projects and growing our competitive business. As we address these opportunities, we believe a modest amount of equity, late this year of up to $300 million subject to market and other conditions, will help to further strengthen our balance sheet and investment-grade metrics and support our growth initiatives. We will explore auctions, which may include implementing a dribble program this -- late this year to effectively address these ongoing requirements. Importantly, this level of equity will not take us off course from the guidance we've reaffirmed for 2013.","Finally, while it is always subject to board approval, I will reiterate that we expect to maintain our dividend. Our regulated operations, distribution and transmission provide a strong foundation of earnings and cash, which support the dividend, and our competitive businesses further support the payout.","As we move forward, we will continue to assess our operations and look for additional opportunities to reduce our cost. Most importantly, we remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by expanded competitive markets and improved economic conditions.","Now I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, just kind of following on maybe on where you left off on your comments just with the fund-raising options between the Harrison transfer of that nearly 1,200 megawatts of hydro sale and then $300 million of equity. Even using pretty conservative assumptions, it seems like you'll get well past the $1.5 billion debt paydown target you guys talked about. How do we put that level of fundraising in context with -- kind of with the strategy of getting down to the $1.5 billion? What happens with the excess money?","James F. Pearson","Well, Dan, as Tony alluded to, we're in the midst of a growth program also. We're investing in our transmission facilities. In conjunction with the Harrison asset transfer, we're going to have an equity infusion down into the Mon Power level. We're also growing our competitive business. And as we said, we believe the finance plan we have laid out with the asset transfer, as well as the asset sales will more than cover the $1.5 billion. But with our focus on growth, we thought it would be prudent to add a bit of equity to the mix.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, if you look out to kind of '14 and beyond, do you see the need to continue raising equity at that kind of rate to support the growth program? Or is this just a rebalancing option in your mind?","James F. Pearson","At this point, Dan, I would consider a rebalancing, but as we go out into the future and continue to look at our growth opportunities, we'll always consider equity in the mix.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, if you have Donny on the phone, Donny, can you talk a little bit about kind of with 96% hedged for 2013, how the volume targets have matched off against what you guys provided at EEI? and if there's any customer segments that are doing better or worse than what you thought you're going to be doing?","Donald R. Schneider","Yes, sure, Dan. So our target hasn't changed. I think at the EEI we said 104 terawatt hours. I would tell that you I have a boss who continually challenges me to exceed that, so we'll see how the year progresses. The 94% is against that original target though.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And are you seeing kind of customer cost mix consistent with original expectations or there's been some movement?","Donald R. Schneider","No. It's still pretty much in line with -- we've really done well on our mass market sales. We've just recently launched our customer choice campaign, and we would see that bringing in additional mass market customers along with continuing to push on gov ag.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just following up on Dan's last question there, with respect to asset sales, et cetera, how does the $300 million kind of jive against expectations there if you could kind of just be a little bit more explicit?","Anthony J. Alexander","I'll just give you my perspective on it. I think  the transactions would otherwise have laid out for the asset sales in Harrison where we're more than adequate to carry out the game plan that we've laid out for debt reduction. The $300 million we talk in terms of equity is going to help support some of the growth initiatives that we have going on throughout the company, including the transmission expansion plans that we have, several plans to increase the capacity at some of our nuclear plants to renew turbines and things of that nature that are beginning to position the company for longer-term growth as this economy improves.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And could you speak to the timing of asset sales? Just is it a this year event? Or is this kind of over the next couple of years or what have you?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, I think the key one that we're talking about at this point, next -- there's always an opportunity for asset sales as you guys well know from our -- what we've done over the last several years. But the key one being the hydro sale, we would like to complete this year, and that's our -- that's what we are targeting to accomplish.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then perhaps going back broadly and tying retail back into this, as I heard your comments, you described growing retail broadly speaking. How does that jive with asset sales here? I mean, are we talking about potentially adding selective assets in markets where perhaps you might want to serve more from your generation, i.e., Eastern PJM or something?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, not at this point. I think at this point, what we're looking at is allowing sales to drive generation investment. And I have confidence in Donny and his team to drive retail sales to the levels beyond where we're at today such that beginning to reinvest in our power plants to reduce forced loss rates, make them more efficient so we can get more kilowatt hours out of the same machines will be where most of our investment is targeted. In the near term, much of that investment is being targeted towards the nuclear upgrades in the -- not only at Beaver Valley in 2012, but 2013, we have upgrades at both Perry and Beaver Valley 2 or Beaver Valley 1 for new turbines. But we have with some major investments in the nuclear fleet with respect to steam generator replacements, which will reduce our long-term O&M costs and give us -- in addition, give us shorter outages, which will create more kilowatt hours from those -- from that fleet to be used and deployed in the retail strategy. So there's a lot of activity going on, and there's a lot of opportunities yet inside the fleet to expand and become more effective with the machines we have before we look outside.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just a real quick clarification. Given pension, mark to market, et cetera, pension funding plans as it stands today, there are no contributions projected for '13 or beyond.","James F. Pearson","That's correct, Julien. Probably the first time that we would make a contribution would be 2016 for the 2015 plan year, and that's just based on current rates. So we don't have any expectation on making a contribution over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just get your general thoughts on low-growth outlook. I know there's a lot of unusual weather activity, and for the year, total low was up 70 basis points from last year. But as you mentioned in your sort of prepared remarks, there was certainly a lot of movement within the investment classes. Could you just talk a little bit further about the 3 customer classes and your general views on the outlook for low growth amongst those 3 classes?","James F. Pearson","Stephen, this is Jim. We're looking at load growth of about 0.5% to 0.6% next year. What we see the residential and commercial areas just growing ever so slightly, and the industrial sector has been sluggish over the last 3 years. It's remained fairly stagnant. Now we're seeing some positive signs such as Ford. They're opening up a new engine plant, and we expect ultimately that we'll start seeing industrial and commercial activity coming from the Marcellus and the Utica Shale that we have in our area. But I don't see that as active in 2013 as maybe it will be when we get out in '14 and beyond.","Anthony J. Alexander","I think that's right, Steve. I'm being a little cautious in terms of how fast this economy will turn around. I think this area is poised to grow and grow at rates that are potentially far greater than what we've seen in the past because of the economic development potential in -- for the Marcellus and Utica Shale. We're all looking -- if you take a look across the area, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, it basically sits on our -- sits under our service territory. There's a lot of expectations right now in terms of a manufacturing renaissance taking advantage of the locational advantage they would have for energy. And we'd hope to see this as a catalyst for a much more significant and much more sustained growth not only in the manufacturing and industrial segments but the fallout of that through the commercial and the residential markets. So, so much depends on what happens to the economy in general in terms of are we going to be growing or continuing to kind of stagnate and are we going to begin to use the resources we have as a country to really reposition the economic capability and potential, particularly of this region, to take advantage of it.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Now that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on, Jim, on the equity side of things. As you think about funding growth, you had mentioned up to $300 million to fund some of your growth objectives. Would you envision the dribble as being the primary method to achieve that?","James F. Pearson","There is various methods there, Stephen. At this point, the dribble method is one that we like.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just quickly on the asset sales, are you looking -- Tony, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly -- exclusively at the hydro Assets? Or are there other things you potentially on the table? Or should we just sort of be focused on that?","Anthony J. Alexander","I think that's the primary one, Jonathan. I mean there's always assets moving around in this company because of -- just because of our location. For example, we have lots of resources and lots of land in -- that sits above Marcellus and Utica Shale. So I mean I suspect there'll be some transactions like that. They'll typically be one-offs. I think the real game here is going to be played on the hydro assets.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And did you -- have you disclosed kind of what book value is on those assets or anything other than just the megawatts?","Anthony J. Alexander","I don't plan on telling anybody what the book value is.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I may, just sort of another front. There's obviously a lot of talk around EPA planning to regulate, have a move forward on regulating carbon. Can you just talk about how that's factoring into your thought process around investment in the coal fleet? What are you thinking comes out of that process? And what sort of time frame do you get enough clarity to sort of be certain that what you're doing on your existing plants will sort of survive future regulation on the CO2 front? Anything you can tell us there?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, I guess, Jonathan, if I had all those answers, I'd feel really good about it. All I can tell you is I think we're preparing ourselves to deal with these issues as best we can. If you take a look at our fleet and you compare, for example, going back in time to either 1990 or 2005, which are the kind of the dates that had been thrown around to measure, we will have reduced our carbon footprint in our fleet significantly beyond what any expectations were at either the Kyoto Protocol of 1990 or the 2005 baselines that were used before. So we've done a lot. A lot of the plants as they get shut down reposition. The investing in the nuclear fleet to produce more out of that side of the house has done -- has improved significantly the -- and reduced significantly the amount of CO2 that our fleet produces. So on balance, a lot of it depends on what the rules are and what the baseline is in terms of what the expectations are going forward. We all know that there's no technology today that's commercially available to address this issue in a major coal-fired facility. So there has to be a transition period. There has to be recognized -- somehow, we have to recognize the time frame associated with it. And quite frankly, I think our fleet's in pretty good position.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Neel Mitra from Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. Can you give us a rough sense of what your earned ROEs were in 2012 and just what opportunities or whether you'd be in the rate case arena besides in New Jersey in Mon Power for the asset swap in the coming years?","Leila L. Vespoli","This is Leila. We do provide information regarding our ROEs in an ongoing basis with our state utility commission, the majority of which is publicly available. And what we're going to be doing, we're going to be pulling together our latest filings and hope to make them available in our investor presentation materials at our conference next week. But I think the long and the short of it is we believe that our utilities are earning a fair return as permitted by state law.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question on the generation side, how willing are you to rely on the purchase power market to fund, I guess, the retail sales? I know now that you're running generation less, you rely more on the purchase power market. And how far are you willing to go on that just in terms of how risky that is?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, obviously, when we think those issues through, the risk is associated with the -- more with the creditworthiness of the person that you're buying from. We will close positions against the sales that we make and then essentially reclose those positions using our own assets once we determine that the sale is sustainable and if we can increase the margin associated with that sale by essentially producing it ourselves.","Operator","Our final question is coming from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","There'd been -- you mentioned the manufacturing that it's on and there'd been a bunch of new power plants that have been announced in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Some of them are merchant. I'm just wondering any thoughts about what that presents in terms of an opportunity to you. Or competitive threat? Or just what do you make of that?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, my own sense is that the market today has sufficient capacity in it, so investments in new generation of significant amounts is -- it could be a problem for the investors.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. The hydro asset, it doesn't sound like you guys are talking about the book value or anything. Can you give us a sense of what the capacity factor is on those plants?","Anthony J. Alexander","Well, we probably could. I don't think we have it with us. But you got to remember you can't look at capacity factor for some of these plants or pump storage because relatively meaningless because -- well, they really run during the day, and they're pumped up at night, then run a river kinds of facilities the rest of them are -- I mean, I don't -- I'm not sure capacity factor is particularly relevant.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean, I guess, you know where I'm coming from. I'm trying to figure the margin if you can tell us that, sort of a sense as to what might be going away as you sell those.","Anthony J. Alexander","We're not particularly concerned about it on our fleet, again, because of the other options we have.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then in terms of the Harrison plant, you guys mentioned the December letter, that if you didn't have 100% of the plant, you may not be able to offer it into the RPM auction at a price that would clear. Given now what the procedural schedule is, it looks like, I mean, the approval's going to happen after the auction. How should we think about that?","Donald R. Schneider","Paul, this is Donny. We'll bid the Harrison plant into the auction in May from FES' side of the equation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But we should expect it to clear?","Donald R. Schneider","Well, we'll treat it like we would any other generator that we bid in, Paul.","Anthony J. Alexander","Yes. The asset's going to bid and I guess, by 2 entities. One would be the utility. They'll choose what to bid. And the other will be FES on their other ownership, and they'll choose what the bid.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the POLR and the PUC in Pennsylvania. It seems like they've changed the rules, and I'm just wondering is that a lot more opportunity -- does that give you guys more opportunity on the retail side there?","Donald R. Schneider","Are you talking about where they are going with these shorter-term bids, Paul?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yes. Sounds like they want to create more volatility almost like they want to sort of force people to shop or encourage them to shop, I guess, is a better way to put it.","Donald R. Schneider","Well, clearly, that Pennsylvania has an objective. They would love to see 100% of the customers shop. And I think that those auctions are designed to do that. We've participated in those processes, and we're very comfortable competing both in the POLR auctions as well as the retail front.","James F. Pearson","Okay. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Tony, Leila and I will be in New York next week for a conference, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. As always, we appreciate your support and your interest in FirstEnergy. Thank you.","Anthony J. Alexander","Thank you, everyone.","Leila L. Vespoli","Thank you.","Anthony J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Beringer, Director, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Beringer. You may begin.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Welcome to FirstEnergy's fourth quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the PowerPoint presentation, which supports today's discussion.","Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Pearson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Leila Vespoli, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Regulatory Affairs and Chief Legal Officer; Jon Taylor, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Steve Staub, Vice President and Treasurer; and Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Jones.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2016 was a successful and transformative year for FirstEnergy. Our long list of significant accomplishments includes achieving the operating earnings targets that we outlined to the financial community, making strong progress on our growth strategy, and launching a plan that supports our transition to a fully-regulated company. During today's call, Jim and I will review our results and recent developments, and provide an update on the strategic review of our Competitive business. While we have a great deal to cover, we still expect to have plenty of time for your questions.","For the year, we reported GAAP loss of $14.49 per share as a result of impairments in our Competitive business, and I'll discuss those more in a few minutes. On an operating earnings basis, we achieved results of $2.63 per share for 2016, which is in line with the revised guidance we provided in November, and for the second year in a row, higher than our original operating earnings guidance for the year. We are proud of the track record we are building to consistently deliver on the commitments we've made.","Like to briefly outline some of our major accomplishments. First, we achieved outstanding operational performance across our company in 2016 with excellent results in distribution and transmission service reliability and plant operations. I'm particularly pleased with our very strong safety results. In 2016, our employees achieved the best safety performance in our company's history. This is the second straight year of setting a new record for safety performance, and I believe this reflects the strong safety culture across our entire organization.","On the financial front, we contributed $500 million worth of stock into our qualified pension plan in December. Coupled with cash contributions totaling $382 million earlier in the year, this more than satisfies our 2016 pension funding obligations, and took pension funding obligations off the table for 2017. We continued our focus on costs through our cash flow improvement plan, exceeding the original targets we laid out with incremental fuel and capital savings in our Competitive business.","In addition, we successfully restructured our credit facilities to provide the necessary financial flexibility to become a fully regulated company. FirstEnergy Corporation and our regulated subsidiaries entered into three new five-year syndicated credit facilities in December. These replace facilities that were set to expire in 2019 and increased the credit available to our 10 distribution companies.","We've also had very successful results from our regulated growth initiatives. In our Transmission business, we completed the transfer of Penelec and Met-Ed transmission assets into our new MAIT subsidiary late last month, following approval from both FERC and the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. While formula rates for both JCP&L and MAIT remain pending at FERC, we requested implementation effective January 1 and February 1 for JCPL (sic) [JCP&L] (5:38) and MAIT, respectively. We're on track for $1 billion in investments and are energizing the future growth initiative in 2017 with a majority of that spend taking place where we have formula rates.","This is the last year of our initial $4.2 billion investment. In November, we announced the continuation of the program with $3.2 billion to $4.8 billion in transmission investments planned in 2018 through 2021. We also announced our plan to issue up to $500 million of incremental equity annually in 2017 through 2019 to help fund these investments.","Turning to the Distribution business, we achieve resolution in several regulatory proceedings that will support continued investment in safe and reliable service for our customers. In Pennsylvania, we received approval of rates case settlements for our four operating companies with an expected Distribution revenue increase of approximately $290 million annually. In New Jersey, the approved settlement for JCP&L provides for an annual Distribution revenue increase of $80 million. And in Ohio, we will collect approximately $200 million annually for at least three years and up to five under the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider. The new rates and the Ohio Rider all went into effect last month.","The combination of successful outcomes in these state proceedings, coupled with our cost savings initiatives, has helped us begin improving our credit metrics. We achieved FFO to debt levels in 2016 which exceeded the minimum thresholds established by both Moody's and S&P. We also reengaged coverage with Fitch and they recently began rating all of our entities.","In December, Mon Power issued an RFP to address the generation shortfall identified in its Integrated Resource Plan, along with a second RFP to sell its interest in the Bath County Pumped Storage Project. RFP for the Integrated Resource Plan seeks a combination of approximately 1,300 megawatts of unforced capacity generation and up to 100 megawatts of demand response. Bids were due on February 3.","Then Charles River Associates in their role as RFP manager began assessing each proposal to determine the best combination of value and reliability for the customers of Mon Power. The assessment includes cost factors, such as the expected customer impact, capacity availability, environmental considerations, and acquisition costs; as well as non-cost factors, such as West Virginia's preference for in-state fuel sources, location and ease of integration. We expect Mon Power to announce the results of both RFPs when it submits its regulatory filing to the West Virginia Public Service Commission and FERC in March.","Finally, in late 2016, we launched a strategic review of our Competitive Generation business to support our exit from that business by mid-2018. This very complex process is on track and we're very pleased with the progress we have made in the short time since our announcement. In November, FES brought on two independent board members and three new employee board members, who reviewed and authorized FES's entry into a new two-year secured credit facility with FirstEnergy that provides liquidity support through 2018. FirstEnergy and FES have both engaged legal and financial advisors to help guide this transition.","We're working on separating FES from the unregulated money pool, and as of January 31, FES, its operating subsidiaries and FENOC, in aggregate, had a money pool investment of $2 million. At this time, FES hasn't drawn on the secured credit facility that is in place with FirstEnergy, but we would expect them to use that facility in the future.","The decision to assess strategic options and our intent to exit the Competitive business by mid-2018 made it necessary to reduce the carrying value of certain of our generating assets to their fair market value, which resulted in the non-cash free tax impairment charges of $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter. I'll note that we remain in compliance with financial covenants in our bank credit facilities as the majority of this after-tax charge is excluded from our covenant calculations of debt to total capitalization.","These impairments, together with second quarter asset impairment and plant exit costs, primarily associated with Bay Shore, Sammis Units 1 through 4, and the goodwill at our Competitive business totaled $16.67 per share. While these are not the kind of results anyone likes to report, writing down the majority of our Competitive Generation assets was a necessary step towards our exit of Competitive Generation, regardless of which path we ultimately take. And it's an important step to more clearly reflect our business in 2017 and beyond.","We continue to assess and evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our companies \u2013 for our Competitive business, including asset sales, legislative or regulatory initiatives for generation that recognizes environmental or energy security benefits, alternatives for our retail business and financial restructuring.","In January, we announced an agreement to sell 1,572 megawatts of gas and hydroelectric generation for $925 million in an all-cash deal, with net proceeds expected to exceed $300 million after we repay debt and associated make-whole call premiums. This includes the Springdale, Chambersburg, Gans and Hunlock gas units in Pennsylvania, as well as the competitive portion of our Bath Hydro unit in Virginia, which are all part of our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of a number of regulatory approvals and consents from third parties.","We continue to explore options for the sale of our West Lorain combined cycle facility and the Buchanan natural gas unit. Otherwise, while the potential of additional generating unit sales or deactivations remains on the table, we do not expect near-term developments in those areas.","In West Virginia, our Allegheny Energy Supply subsidiary offered its 1,300 megawatt Pleasants plant into the Mon Power RFP earlier this month for approximately $195 million or $150 per KW. As I mentioned earlier, Mon Power is expected to announce the results of that RFP next month.","In Ohio, we have had meaningful dialog with our fellow utilities and with legislators on solutions that can help ensure Ohio's future energy security. Our top priority is the preservation of our two nuclear plants in the state, and legislation for zero-emission nuclear program is expected to be introduced soon.","The ZEN program is intended to give state lawmakers greater control and flexibility to preserve valuable nuclear generation. We believe this legislation would preserve not only zero-emission assets, but jobs, economic growth, fuel diversity, price stability, and reliability and grid security for the region. We are advocating for Ohio's support for its two nuclear plants, even though the likely outcome is that FirstEnergy won't be the long-term owner of these assets. We are optimistic given these discussions we've had so far, and we'll keep you posted as this process unfolds.","On a related topic, as you may know, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission typically relies on parental support agreements to provide additional assurance that U.S. merchant nuclear plants have the financial resources to maintain safe operations, particularly in the event of an extraordinary situation.","In addition to the $500 million credit facility provided to FES by FirstEnergy that provides for ordinary operating liquidity needs, FirstEnergy is now working with FES to establish conditional credit support on terms and conditions to be agreed upon for the $400 million FES parental support agreement that is currently in place, benefiting FE Nuclear Generation. As always, the continued safe operation of these nuclear assets is of utmost importance and is consistent with our pursuit of environmental credits for the assets through a ZEN program.","Moving back to our review of the Competitive business, I'd like to add that we may also explore the possibility of engaging creditors to restructure debt at FES. And as we discussed, there remains the possibility that FES and potentially FENOC may seek bankruptcy protection, although no such decision has been made. This initial phase of our review has been productive and we will continue sharing updates with you as we move forward. We remain committed to implementing our exit from Competitive Generation by mid-2018 to complete our transformation into a regulated company.","While we're speaking of generation, we received numerous questions about Bruce Mansfield's operating status last week. So I wanted to clear up some confusion. First, the new dewatering facility is in place and it is working as designed. We have had some of the normal growing pains with obtaining the right consistency for the byproducts at the third-party disposal site; however, we are working with a contractor and believe we're on track to resolve that issue. All three units at Mansfield are operational, but they are currently on economic reserve due to low power prices, consistent with our normal dispatch strategy.","Before I turn it over to Jim, I'll spend a minute reviewing our expectations for 2017. As we announced yesterday, we're raising operating earnings guidance for the year. This primarily reflects improvements at our Competitive business related to the significant reduction in depreciation expense resulting from the fourth quarter impairment, somewhat offset by advisory costs and the commodity margin impact of the proposed asset sale.","Our GAAP earnings forecast is now $2.47 to $2.77 per share. Operating earnings guidance has been raised to $2.70 to $3.00 per share from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share that we announced at EEI. In our regulated businesses, we continue to anticipate a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 6% from our 2016 weather-adjusted base, or 7% to 9%, when including the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider through 2019. We will seek incremental opportunities for growth in our regulated businesses in the next few years.","Again, we have much to be proud of in 2016 from solid operating results to our operating performance, and the progress we are making towards our goals. In 2017, we'll remain fully focused on positioning the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report, which was posted to our website yesterday afternoon. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A session or following the call.","As Chuck explained, the impairment of our competitive assets resulted in a fourth quarter GAAP charge of $13.54, and this drove our GAAP loss of $13.44 per share in the fourth quarter, and $14.49 per share for the full year. A full list of special items can be found in the consolidated report.","Operating earnings were $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter and $2.63 per share for the year. As Chuck indicated, these results were stronger than our original estimates and in line with our revised operating earnings guidance.","In our Distribution business, fourth quarter deliveries increased 4% overall compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of higher weather-related usage and stronger commercial and industrial demand. While heating degree days were 26% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, they were 9% below normal, and this milder-than-normal weather impacted our fourth quarter results as compared to our guidance.","Fourth quarter 2016 residential deliveries increased 8% compared to last year and were flat on a weather-adjusted basis. Commercial deliveries were up 3% or 1% when adjusted for weather. In the industrial sector, deliveries increased 1.8%, driven primarily by higher usage in the shale and steel sectors. This follows a similar increase in the third quarter 2016, and we remain cautiously optimistic about these positive trends. We are forecasting a 3.5% increase in industrial deliveries in 2017.","Moving to our Transmission business, fourth quarter earnings increased by $0.02 per share due to higher revenues related to our Energizing the Future program. And in our corporate segment, results were primarily impacted by higher operating expenses and interest expenses.","In our Competitive business, operating earnings were slightly better than our expectations. Commodity margin decreased due to lower capacity revenues related to the capacity prices that went into effect in June as well as lower contract sales volume. This was partially offset by increased wholesale sales, lower capacity expense, and a lower fuel rate, as well as lower-than-anticipated operating expenses. The customer count for our Competitive business is currently about 1.1 million down from 1.6 million.","In 2016, our contract sales were 53 million megawatt hours with 15 million megawatt hours being sold in the wholesale spot market. On an annual basis, we currently have about 70 million to 75 million megawatt hours to sell, decreasing to 65 million to 70 million megawatt hours once we complete the gas and hydro asset sale.","As we carefully manage our collateral exposure at FES in light of its credit quality, we are closing out certain forward financial hedges we made for 2017 and 2018. This will reduce the committed sales we have and increase our open position for spot sales going forward. As a result, we expect contract sales to total 40 million megawatt hours in 2017 and 2018 with the remainder sold in the spot market.","Before I open the call to your questions, I'll spend a minute going over potential implications of some of the tax reform proposals that have been getting quite a bit of attention lately. We have been very engaged with others in our industry to work toward an outcome that would minimize any negative impacts. With ideas still percolating from the House, the Senate, and the President, it is too early to speculate on the details of an eventual tax reform proposal. But based on the blueprint that was released by the House last year, we can give you a sense of how that tax proposal might impact FirstEnergy.","Any decrease in the effective tax rate at the utilities could result in lower rates for customers, which would flow through to our FFO given that we aren't a federal cash taxpayer. In addition, since we have about $8 billion of holding company debt between FirstEnergy Corp. and FET, the loss of interest deductibility would disallow approximately $300 million of interest expense, which would negatively impact earnings by at least $0.20 per share.","Finally, with 100% bonus depreciation, we would not anticipate being a federal cash taxpayer in the near future. Again, we are working closely with others in our industry to educate Congressional leaders about the importance of interest deductibility for companies like ours. We do support sensible tax reforms which would ultimately benefit the overall economy and industries in our service territory, and we will remain focused on this important and evolving legislation.","As Chuck said, 2016 was a very productive year for FirstEnergy and we are pleased with our progress on our regulated growth strategy. We remain committed to positioning the company for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth to benefit customers, employees and shareholders.","Now, I'd like to open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to discuss the zero-emission approach in Ohio, and just wanted to think about that in the context of potentially seeking bankruptcy protection. Would a success in Ohio preclude the need for bankruptcy protection or would it more likely simply allow the nuclear units to continue operating, but might not impact your overall decision about seeking bankruptcy protection for FES?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, here's what I said in my prepared remarks, and I'll elaborate on it a little bit. I think that it is very important for the state of Ohio to look to the future and how they're going to provide for energy security, grid security, and not just from an electric perspective, the economic impact in terms of jobs and taxes and so forth that are associated with these two facilities. I've been very upfront with the legislators that I have met with personally to tell them don't do this for FirstEnergy because it's unlikely we're going to be the long-term owner operators of these assets.","So now, your second question on how that might enter into a bankruptcy? That decision is going to be ultimately made by the FES board. And the FES board's going to look at what impact that has at that point in time. I think, though, it's very unlikely. You saw what we did with the impairment on the assets. That leaves the book value of our FES business somewhere around $1.5 billion and we've already communicated what the secured and unsecured debt associated with that business is. I think it's highly unlikely we'll get the value of that business to a place where the book value is greater than the debt. So...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. That makes sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, first quick question here a little bit on the numbers. Just in terms of reconciling FFO from the Competitive segment relative to adjusted EBITDA, obviously, adjusted EBITDA going down. But the FFO numbers are a little bit higher net-net versus the adjusted EBITDA. What's the reconciliation there? And also can you discuss \u2013 I imagine the bulk of the FFO is at the FES side of the CES business. To what extent should we kind of consider that as kind of a proxy for the FES cash flows, minus perhaps a little bit for the remaining coal asset on the other side of Pleasants (27:22)?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Let me take a shot at that, Julien, a lot of questions out there. Let me talk about the Competitive segment free cash flow. Let me start with that. It's up a little over $400 million. And what's driving that is the asset sale generated about $815 million. But then when you get into some other components, increased advisory fees are reducing it by about $90 million. The commodity margin is down about $95 million. That's associated with the sale of the AES assets. And also the cash receipts at the Competitive segments are down about $180 million. This is associated with the gain on the sale. So when I take that to the FirstEnergy level, the FFO is down about $200 million from the original guidance. And that's primarily the advisory fees that we're paying of about $90 million, as well as the reduced commodity margin, about a $95 million.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just reconciling adjusted EBITDA versus FFO?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay. When you look at the adjusted EBITDA, again, it's impacted primarily by the lower commodity margin of about $95 million as well as the advisory fees that were $90 million. So, those are the primary drivers there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the 10-K references a February 24 decision here on the coal litigation. Do you expect to 8-K that and\/or (29:16) any further rollout of data points after that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't think it references a February 24 decision. It says that that's the end of the initial phase of the hearing on whether or not \u2013 or where the liability is going to fall. Following that, the arbitration panel has time yet to then make their decision on liability. And then following that, there would be additional time, if there is liability, to determine what that liability would be. So we're...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","...several months, at least, away from knowing any damages, if there are to be damages, and a while away from knowing what the arbitrators decide on liability.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Excellent. And just a last quick one, what was the earned ROE in Pennsylvania across the utilities in 2016? I know you disclosed it for 2015 here in the disclosures, but just to reconcile.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","As a result of our last rate case that settled, it was a black box, so there was no ROE.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Fair enough. I'll follow it offline. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. John Kiani with Cove Key Management (30:44). Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Morning.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","Morning.","Unknown Speaker","I'm trying to make sure I can reconcile the amount and add up the amount of support that FE Corp. is giving to FES, just wanted to see if I'm thinking about this correctly. Is the $400 million incremental \u2013 or additional credit support for the Nuclear Generation business that you disclosed in the K and on slide six of your deck, is that incremental to the $500 million secured revolver that you all put in place between the parent and FES and the $200 million additional credit support or LC facility as well? So, is the total $500 million plus $400 million plus $200 million, or how should I think about that, please?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, let's take the $400 off to the side here for a second. There is an obligation under our agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to maintain $400 million of liquidity. That can be accomplished by liquidity or by a parental guarantee that we would backstop that liquidity. That is what we're working on.","That would only ever be exercised in the event of an extraordinary set of conditions resulting in all four of our nuclear reactors being offline for an extended period of time. Other than that, it's an insurance policy to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but there's not an opportunity for FES to draw down on that. And we're talking about three nuclear plants that are excellent operating nuclear plants. Well, at least, two that are at the high end and one at \u2013 I mean, they have run very, very well. So, the likelihood of all three sites and all four units being off for an extended period of time is very, very unlikely. But there is a requirement that we ensure that there is liquidity available under our agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The $500 million you know about already. And then what was the \u2013 go ahead.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","The $200 million, that was a guarantee on the surety bonds.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes. So, those two are both additive.","Unknown Speaker","And that $200 million, is that where the LC is posted to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for Little Blue Run? Is that correct?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, John (33:24). Yeah, that makes up about $169 million of the $200 million. That's right.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then, along the same lines of the nuclear support, in the hypothetical event of a FES or nuclear generation bankruptcy, who is ultimately liable for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts or any shortfalls or topping off that would need to be done at the \u2013 for the NDT? Is it FES? Or is it possible that FE Corp. could be required to guarantee it, because some of the licenses sit at FENOC? How should we think about that, please?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, at the time that that would occur, the Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts would be funded at an appropriate level. And as long as those assets continue to run, would continue to get funded through the useful life of the plants. Ultimately, where that ends up, I believe, and I'm going to ask Leila to help me here, will be determined through a bankruptcy process, if there's a bankruptcy.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, just to add a little bit more detail, it's licensee owner that would be responsible. In our case, that's our nuclear gen-co. Right now, the NDTs, given the license duration, is fully-funded. So, FirstEnergy right now is not responsible; it is the license owner.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then, one more last question, please. How should we just think about or how would the board of FES or, just in general, how do you think about managing the liquidity of FES and the June 1 putable maturity that exists? I think the business generates a lot of its free cash flow typically towards the latter half of the year, but obviously that maturity is coming up sooner than that. So, how do you think about paying that maturity off or not in the context of how the free cash flow of the business is a little bit more back end of the year weighted, please?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, in the context of the environment that we are operating in, that's not a question for FirstEnergy to answer. We have begun the process of separating FES and FirstEnergy when we put in place a separate board for FES. And that's a decision that the FES board is going to have to wrestle with as that date approaches.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning, guys.","Meghan Geiger Beringer - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just wanted to follow-up on John's (36:21) questions here, and I apologize for me being a little dense, but what is the total amount \u2013 the $400 million, you were very clear on, what \u2013 that's associated with all the four nuclear reactors being shut down. But what is the amount absent that that we should think about as being the parent's commitment to FES?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yes, Paul, I would say the commitment to FES is a $500 million secured credit facility and that's secured by first mortgage bonds as well as a $200 million surety bond, which is also secured.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Now, we have stated that FirstEnergy Corp. guarantees the entire amount of the pension and executive deferred compensation benefit plans, which we consider that, and always have considered that, an FE Corp. responsibility.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How much is that again?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That would be in the range of about $1 billion and that will change as the discount rates change as well as we make future contributions to the pension plan. And as Chuck said, we do not have any requirements to make any pension contributions in 2017. However, the period 2018 through 2021, we have about $1.8 billion of required pension contributions and about $700 million years thereafter.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","And aside from that, Paul, I think we've been very clear that we do not intend to support that business from FirstEnergy any longer.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the $400 million associated with the NRC commitment, you guys are looking for ZECs, and I guess what I'm wondering is, what \u2013 that would suggest that some of these plants or some of these reactors are at economic risk for closure. Am I wrong? So, how should we think about the need for ZECs, and if that weren't forthcoming, the likelihood that these reactors might have to shut down?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, I can't speak for prospective new owners of these four nuclear units. But I can tell you this. Running nuclear reactors isn't something that just anybody can do. And there is a significant amount of capital risk associated with that business, depending on how these assets, if there's a restructuring or a bankruptcy, where they ultimately go, and who ultimately owns them. I'm not sure people are going to be willing to take on the risk of even the next refueling outage, which is very expensive. So, I don't think there's any guarantee, absent some other support for these units, that they're going to keep running far into the future.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much for the clarity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, on the nuclear point \u2013 Hi. So, on the nuclear point, just wanted to clarify, clearly, as you pointed out right, it's not \u2013 there's very few real buyers for nuclear assets in the market. And if there weren't ZECs, it's very unlikely that somebody steps up. Is that a fair way of understanding it that if there are no ZECs, what is the situation you're left with at that point? Because if there's no buyer for it, are you going to hold on \u2013 are you forced to hold on to the assets, or how should we think of that?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I think you should think about it this way. And I said earlier, these assets are now valued at somewhere around $1.5 billion. And that includes the nuclear fuel that they own. The debt is significantly higher than that. Absent something to raise the value of these units and make them attractive to a buyer, there's only one way for us to exit this business.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. Understood. And then secondly, I know that on the call you've mentioned some of the forward hedges of contracts that you had have been sold to minimize the support. Just want to understand, how is that treated? Like, is that treated as cash today? And is that flowing into EBITDA or cash flow? Where does that sit right now, the benefit of the sale of the forward contracts?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah. Any benefit of unwinding of those forward contracts would flow through. I think the key component is, is it reduces the amount of collateral that we were required to have outstanding. So, that impacts our cash. And from the end of the year until where we are right now, we've reduced our collateral requirements by about $70 million.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. No, I get the collateral requirement benefit. I'm just trying to figure out like just where does that sit, like, in your forecast or in your \u2013 is it in cash flow, free cash, but not in EBITDA, just so I understand where that does (41:45)?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's right. It would be in our cash flow. Any gains or losses associated with unwinding that would flow through to EBITDA, but that was not anything that would be material. Just the return of the cash would be part of our cash flow.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Hey, Jon.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a question on the tax reform slide. Firstly, I just want to make sure I understand the $0.20 number that you referenced in the second bullet. Is that discrete to eliminating interest expense deductions at the hold-co? And am I correct that there'd be maybe another dime or so of exposure just from the lower tax rate on the parent company drag, or am I thinking about that wrong?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","No, the way I would think about that, Jonathan, is we've got a little over $300 million in interest expense, and losing that 35% deductibility is about $100 million. And you divide it by your shares outstanding, that's how you get to the number we were talking about there. We did not try to quantify anything else at that point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, that was just the interest component of the parent company?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's purely the interest component associated with that. That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, you obviously are flagging the risk to your FFO. Can you talk at all about potential implications given where you are on credit metrics at certain scenarios and maybe frame that a little more for us? And maybe what your priority responses might be if you needed to address it?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, Jonathan, over the last couple of years, I have resisted trying to guess about what the future might be. And I think this whole tax reform issue is getting a lot of attention. Obviously, all of my other peers have commented on it. Whether or not it even happens in my mind is a question and what version happens. There's a different version that the President has than what the House has and what the Senate has, and we haven't even started to really run all those issues to ground.","I will tell you this. I've been attending EEI CEO meetings since 2001, and our industry coalesced around what the right answer for our industry is with regard to this, quicker on this issue than I have ever seen it happened. Several of my peers, who I have a tremendous amount of respect for, have already been to Washington DC to talk about the impact on our industry. And what they're trying to do with tax reform is inject money into the economy from a supply side to jumpstart this economy. Capital formation in our industry is not a problem. And this would actually have the inverse effect on our industry of what they're trying to accomplish.","So, I think our representatives felt like they had meaningful discussions. And so, I don't think there's any reason for us to be playing Doomsday at this point with regard to FirstEnergy or anyone else in this industry.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would your inclination be to step up capital spend, I guess? Really, my question is whether \u2013 because others have emphasized that as being an offset. I felt you're not really doing that. Is the balance sheet a constraint on going down that path, or do you think you would be playing that card, too?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","As I said, if you can tell me where it's going to end up, then we can tell you how we will react to it. But I'm not going to speculate about where it's going to end up or the impact it's going to have on what we do. I do think, obviously, if the House plan got accepted exactly as it's been promulgated so far, it would be a difficult issue for our industry to wrestle with.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Chuck.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Gregg Orrill with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about the taxes a little bit in terms of \u2013 you're not a cash taxpayer. Would it be possible to provide some guidance around how much of the benefits come from the NOL versus the taking of bonus depreciation, or at least, mechanically, give us a way to think about how both of those are impacting the cash flows?","K. Jon Taylor - FirstEnergy Corp.","Gregg, this is Jon. As you know, we're not a federal cash taxpayer today. The federal NOL as of the end of the year was $5 billion. So, we don't anticipate being a federal taxpayer for some time until (47:17) 2021, 2022. With respect to bonus, we've been dealing with some form of bonus depreciation for the last 5 to 10 years, and it's just something that we'll have to continue to look at.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ms. Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, just one follow-up. So, I'm look at your financial plan slide from the fourth quarter fact-book and compare it against the EEI financial plan slide, and there's a small change in the wording. You are skipping the word for FE Corp. from your commitment to investment-grade credit rating. Is that intentional?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","No.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","We are committed to investment-grade credit metrics at FE Corp.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just I'm trying to get a proxy in thinking about those core regulated businesses at FE. Could you talk a little bit about what you're kind of expecting for growth on the Distribution side after 2017 and kind of compare that to growth on the Regulated Transmission side after 2017?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, I would say, Michael, that what we're talking about is average annual growth for T&D of 4% to 6% per year. It would be ramped up a little bit in the earlier years because of the $200 million that we're receiving in Ohio. But obviously, that goes away at some point in time. And the way I think about it is this. We have numerous investment mechanisms through riders on the Distribution side of our company in Ohio and Pennsylvania, in particular. We have formula rates so far with ATSI and TrAILCo. And eventually, when we get another FERC Commissioner, we'll have one for MAIT and JCP&L.","So, we have the ability to move those funds around quite a bit between T&D and from state to state, et cetera, et cetera. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to address some of the reliability challenges that we see on our wire side of our company. And hopefully, at some point, some of the load growth that we're going to see on the wire side of our company. So, I think you should think about it in terms of the combination of the two, because we're going to move money around.","And I think, probably, in the very near future, we're going to start having dialog with the Ohio Commission on their grid modernization ideas. The extent we move forward there, that has the same return on equity as a transmission formula rate. So, that might move some money around there too. So there's just so many moving parts, I don't want to commit that it's going to be this for Transmission and this for Distribution. I'd rather just tell you, you can count on 4% to 6%. And as I said in my remarks, as we move a little bit farther down the tracks, we're going to look at ways to ramp that up over the next few years.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just curious on the Transmission \u2013 actually, before I ask that one, I want to come back to New Jersey, because you brought up JCP&L a little bit. Some of your peers in New Jersey have very different rate-making mechanisms than what JCP&L has. Just curious, where are you in the process, if anywhere, in talking with interveners and with the BPU about being able to adopt some of those same rate-making mechanisms for JCP&L?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Well, here's what I would say. We finally got a settlement on a rate case in New Jersey for the first time in the 15 years that we've owned JCP&L. That was a tremendous accomplishment on our part. We've had a lots of issues over there with four horrific storms, with some reliability issues early on in our ownership of JCP&L, with some union issues early on in our ownership of JCP&L. I think the settlement on this case was a big step forward for us in terms of our relationship in New Jersey. We would not have been able to get that accomplished if we didn't have solid relationships with our local elected officials that are much better than they ever were, with the BPU, and if we weren't performing over there. So, that's all a good place to be.","The paint isn't even dry on that settlement yet. It just went into effect last month. So, I think now is the time that over time we'll start having discussions with the BPU about what types of investments do they want to see and what mechanisms would they be interested in considering to do it. And more to come on that. But we're not having any right now.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Chuck. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, and sorry for getting disconnected earlier. Just had one quick follow-up on the pension obligation at the Competitive business. I think I saw in the appendix that the net impact was about $700 million rather than $1 billion. But I just wanted to check on the magnitude of the liability, essentially, that the parent company has for that pension?","Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.","Steve, it's Steve Staub. It also takes into consideration the OPEB, which actually has a positive balance, so it nets out to about $700 million with respect to the pension and OPEB. And then, there's some other guarantees that Jim had mentioned specific to the executive deferred comp as well as some other small guarantees that add up to about $1 billion.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just hopefully two quick questions. One, it appears that if a ZEC does get passed in Ohio, it's \u2013 I don't know if to use these words, unlikely that FE would be the owner of these assets, would that change FE's \u2013 would FE's intention \u2013 would you be inclined to own a nuclear plant if they were rate based?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I don't see any possibility that they're going to be rate based in the timeframe that I've committed to you that we're going to exit this Competitive Generation. So, I don't even think we should even be talking about that. We are going to work hard on this ZEN legislation, because I believe it's the right thing to do for the state of Ohio. I believe it's the right thing to do for these assets. I believe it's the right thing to do for our employees that work at these facilities. And I think it's the right thing to do for those communities that these big, huge manufacturing facilities are resident in. So, we're going to do it for all the right reasons, even though it's not going to, ultimately, I don't think, have any impact to the shareholder value of FirstEnergy over the long haul.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And just lastly, a more housekeeping. On the fourth quarter \u2013 in fourth quarter results, corporate and other took a charge, I guess, for legacy coal plants. Any reason that was not at the op-cos?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Now, that...","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Go ahead.","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Those are assets that were former GPU assets. They are those manufactured gas plants. So, they don't really pertain to any of the other segments. That's why we've decided to keep them there. In fact, last year, we had a similar charge, but it was not in the fourth quarter. So, we've just been recording it in that segment.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay, Stephen (sic) [Anthony] (56:04).","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Thank you. Just a quick one on Transmission. You have a pretty tight earnings guidance range; $360 million to $380 million, yet there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the timing and eventual outcome of some of these FERC-related cases and obviously with the vacancy on the FERC Commission. Does that range still take into account that uncertainty?","James F. Pearson - FirstEnergy Corp.","Charles, no, this is Jim. No, that range was based on having those rates go into effect January 1. At a time that we find out that something may be different than that, then we'll update that guidance. But what you're looking at is assuming that both MAIT and JCP&L go into effect at the beginning of the year.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Go ahead.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I would add on to that, though, that inside a company that's as big as ours, with 10 regulated distribution companies and the transmission footprint that we have, we have the ability, in the interim until we have certainty on how we're going to get our returns through MAIT, to move some of our capital plan around into other formula rates. And I am not excusing our energy delivery leader from meeting his earnings targets this year just because that's been delayed.","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","And, Charles, this is Leila. One point of clarification. So, staff does now have some delegated authority. And if they so \u2013 chose to do so, they could use that delegated authority and put the rates into effect January 1, February 1, subject to refund. So you don't need the FERC (57:56) Commissioner in order for that to happen is my point.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay, Leila. So, these issues are staff \u2013 are at the level that the staff could make a decision?","Leila L. Vespoli - FirstEnergy Corp.","Correct. They're within staff domain at this point.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my call. I think in the beginning, you mentioned that you're in the process of separating FES from the unregulated money pool. Can you just expand on that a little? What are the kind of final hurdles there?","Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.","Yeah, it's Steve. We are in a process of doing that and we expect by the end of the first quarter to have FES, its subsidiaries, and FENOC operating under their own separate money pool. And so, we expect to have that in place shortly.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for the asset sale proceeds, I saw that in your presentation, you changed 2019 issuance guidance. Is that kind of telegraphing potential de-levering at the holding company?","Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.","Can you repeat your question, please?","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In your EEI presentation, I think for 2019, you talked about refinancing the term loan that's due then. In the fourth quarter presentation, that's missing from the financing plan. So, is that kind of telegraphing that maybe you'll look to pay down that 2019 term loan?","Steven R. Staub - FirstEnergy Corp.","So, the 2019 term loan was refinanced in December of 2016, in line with the restructuring of our credit facilities.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, that just kind of pushed out everything.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","That's right.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, just the last one, Chuck, you mentioned West Lorain and Buchanan as potential asset sales. But also, you touched upon the alternatives for the retail business. Can you just talk a little bit more about what are you looking at there?","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","I can't talk about what we're looking at there, because again I think that is going to be the responsibility of the FES board to look at it. But I think what I said is, other than West Lorain and Buchanan, I don't think you should expect any announcements in the near future.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","Okay.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Pearson for closing comment.","Charles E. Jones - FirstEnergy Corp.","All right.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session fill follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may now begin. ","Irene Prezelj","Thanks, Rob. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today\u2019s discussion.","Participants in today\u2019s call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Jones","Thank you, Irene. And good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced strong results for the third quarter with GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and operating earnings of $0.76 per share. Consistent with our nearly five year track record of delivering on our commitments to you, our third quarter operating earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. As a reminder, when we held our second quarter call, we were waiting for our final outcome related to our Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider. Because of this, the third quarter guidance we provided to you included a $0.06 benefit from the DMR. While the rider was ultimately removed from our Ohio rate plan, I\u2019m pleased that we were able to offset its absence during the quarter through a combination of favorable weather compared to normal, the continued strong execution of our customer service oriented growth strategy and O&M discipline. ","For the full year, we\u2019re narrowing our 2019 operating earnings guidance to $2.50 per share to $2.60 per share. This reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as the absence of the DMR in the second half. We\u2019re also providing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.60 per share and affirming our projection for 6% to 8% of compound annual operating earnings growth from 2018 through 2021. ","I know you're anxious for us to communicate both our CAGR and equity plans beyond the 2018 to 2021 timeframe. We will provide this information as soon as it makes sense once we've completed our internal financial planning process. That should not be taken as any indication that either of these will ultimately be disappointing to the market. It's simply that I am very protective of our five year track record of meeting or exceeding every commitment we have made and I need to get the detailed planning in place before getting ahead of that process. ","Now, let's review our progress with our customer focused growth strategies at our utilities. In late August, each of our four Pennsylvania utilities filed new Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plans or LTIIPs for the 2020 through 2024 period. The filings outline our plans to invest $572 million over that timeframe to accelerate infrastructure improvements and enhance service reliability for more than 2 million customers in Pennsylvania. These investments build on earlier improvement plans and included targeted projects that are designed to reduce the frequency of electric service interruptions for customers and shorten the duration of outages when they do occur. ","Major initiatives will include; replacing older infrastructure with new poles, overhead lines, underground cables, substation equipment, network valves and manholes, reconfiguring circuits to minimize customers impacted by service interruptions and installing more advanced smart devices that can detect and isolate problems to help quickly restore power to impacted customers. The work outlined in the LTIIP programs accelerates infrastructure repairs, improvements and replacements while also introducing new investments to enhance our distribution, infrastructure and service reliability. We expect to recover the costs associated with the LTIIP through the DSIC rider mechanism. ","We look forward working with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to have the plans approved by the end of the year, so work can begin in early 2020. ","Before we move from Pennsylvania, on our last call, we mentioned that we were in discussions to transfer the responsibility for decommissioning Three Mile Island Unit 2 to a subsidiary of EnergySolutions, LLC. This would remove any future nuclear decommission obligations from FirstEnergy and further simplify our regulated focus. In October, we signed that agreement, which includes transferring the plant, property, nuclear decommissioning trust and plant license as well as the associated liabilities and responsibility for decommissioning. While the agreement is subject to regulatory approvals, we expect transfer to take place around the second half of 2020. ","Turning to Ohio, we are beginning to implement our $516 million three-year Grid Modernization program, which was approved by the Public Utilities Commission in July. We're laying the groundwork to begin construction on these projects during the first quarter of next year. Our investments include the installation of 700,000 smart meters and related infrastructure, building an advanced distribution management system in our Ohio Edison Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison service areas, selling automated equipment on at least 200 distribution lines that can automatically isolate problems, prevent entire circuit outages and quickly restore electric service to customers, installing voltage regulating equipment on more than 200 circuits to provide energy efficiency benefits by optimizing voltage levels on the distribution grid. ","In addition, we have committed to developing time varying rates that give customers the opportunity to reduce their monthly electric bill by using energy during off-peak periods. Together, these modernization projects are expected to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage. As you\u2019ll recall, the Grid Mod order also fully resolved the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we began implementing those tax savings for customers on September 1. ","Later this month, we expect to file plans with the PUCO to implement a decoupling mechanism in Ohio. As we discussed last quarter, decoupling breaks the link between utility revenue and the amount of electricity consumed by customers. This supports continued energy efficiency efforts while ensuring that our utilities have adequate resources to continue providing safe and reliable power to our customers. Our plan ensures that residential and commercial customers pay no more for base distribution service than was charged in 2018. After our filing the commission will have 60 days to review and approve the application. ","Moving to our transmission business, last week we filed a plan with FERC to our move New Jersey transmission assets onto a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1, 2020. The JCP&L transmission assets are currently on stated rates based on a settlement approved by FERC in February of 2018. A rate moratorium that was part of that settlement will expire on December 31. Our forward-looking formula rate plan would support energizing the future investment needs in New Jersey including approximately $175 million in capital spending planned for 2020. We expect an initial response from FERC by the end of December. ","Finally, in mid-October the bankruptcy court approved FES\u2019 plan of reorganization. FES has stated that it plans to emerge as an independent company with a new name by the end of this year.","Now, let\u2019s look ahead to next week, when we will see many of you at EEI. At the meeting, we forward-looking to sharing with you our new corporate responsibility report and strategic plan. These reports support our commitment to increased transparency and engagement with investors, customers and other stakeholders, while providing a platform to track our progress as we transition to a cleaner, smarter and more sustainable energy future. Corporate Responsibility Report is aligned with the five pillars of our mission statement. It includes extensive detail on our initiatives from reducing the environmental impact of our operations and upholding high standards for corporate governance, to advancing employee and public safety while building a diverse and inclusive workplace. ","The report includes our initial steps to provide data in alignment with the global reporting initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board metrics as well as links to our policies. We plan to update the Corporate Responsibility Report annually including a data refresh next year in alignment with our 2019 annual report. ","At EEI, we will also introduce our first public strategic plan using the foundation of our seven core values, the plan clearly articulates our vision for the next five years. It includes our approach to the rapid changes in our industry, fueled by involving customer expectations, emerging technologies and a lower-carbon economy. As we have continuously demonstrated over the past several years, FirstEnergy and our dedicated employees are prepared to meet any challenge as we work together to deliver energy for a brighter future. ","Thank you for your time. We\u2019ve made great progress this year and we remain focused on executing our strategies for a sustainable customer focused growth that will continue to build value for our investors, customers, communities, and employees. ","Now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the third quarter. ","Steve Strah","Good morning. It's good to speak with you today. Before I begin, I will remind you that all reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available on our website in the strategic and financial highlights document. Also, you will recall that because of the preferred shares issuance in January 2018, we have been presenting our operating results and projections on a fully diluted basis to ensure the best comparative view of our performance. As of August 1, all of the outstanding preferred shares were converted to common stock. ","Now, let's review our results. Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share. Operating earnings were $0.76 per share. As Chuck mentioned, this was above the midpoint of our guidance. In the distribution business, earnings decreased compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of more moderate weather compared to the very hot conditions last summer. Results for the third quarter of 2019 also reflect the absence of the DMR in Ohio as well as higher expenses and depreciation. These factors were slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate and lower net financing costs. ","Distribution deliveries decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2018 both on a natural and weather-adjusted basis. Cooling degree days were 22% above normal for the third quarter, but 9% lower than the third quarter of 2018. Residential sales were down 2.2% on an actual basis compared to the third quarter of 2018, but slightly increased on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see a very slight increase in weather-adjusted residential sales over the last 12 months. ","Third quarter sales in the commercial customer class decreased 3.8% on an actual basis and 2.9% when adjusted for weather compared to the third quarter of 2018. This change was driven largely by lower demand in the education sector, partially due to the implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as decreases in the food and beverage and real estate sectors. In our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 1% as continued growth in the shale gas sector was offset by lower usage from steel, automotive and chemical manufacturers, including the impact of the shutdown of the GM Lordstown plant earlier this year. ","While we continue to watch these trends very closely, load for each customer segment remains in line with our forecast with bright spots including stable residential customer usage and modest growth in both residential and commercial customer accounts. ","Looking at our transmission business, earnings increased primarily as a result of higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to the continued investments in the energizing the future program. And in our corporate segment, third quarter results reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a third quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy foundation. ","Before we open the call to your questions, we have a few other financial matters to discuss. First, it is our custom to providing estimate of the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment which is a non-cash item along with third quarter results. Based on market conditions as of September 30, we estimate that adjustment to be in the range of $400 million to $1 billion. As always, the final adjustment will be determined by the discount rate and asset returns at the end of the year. ","Our return on assets currently stand at a solid 17% plus for 2019. Looking ahead, if these results hold through the end of the year, we would be on track to decrease our 2022 funding requirements by approximately $140 million. In addition, while the lower interest rate environment resulted in a higher pension liability, our funded status has slightly improved to 78% from 77% at year end 2018. ","Second, during the third quarter we successfully expanded our corporate term loans and now have a $1 billion one-year facility and a $750 million two-year facility. We will evaluate refinancing some or all of these amounts into the capital market sometime next year. Finally, we met with the rating agencies earlier this quarter to review our progress on our goals as a fully regulated company with an improved risk profile. We expect all three to provide normal course updates on our entities possibly as soon as EEI.","Thank you. We continue to be committed to executing our strategies and meeting our commitments to investors. Now let\u2019s take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. ","Shahriar Pourreza","Just a quick question on the pension. So, with pension coming in better than expected, can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you think about the flexibility that could sort of provide if these results kind of hold i.e lowering future equity needs post \u201821. You\u2019ve talked about pension as being one of those levers versus using that flexibility to deploy additional capital. So any thoughts on how we should think about the incremental flexibility that you could get?","Chuck Jones","I think the way you think about is Shar as what Steve said in his prepared remarks is that we don\u2019t have no required pension contribution through 2022, so -- and it\u2019s reduced our 2022 requirement by about $140 million. So between now and 2022, I don't think it has any direct impact on our business. It just has an impact on the funding requirement that we will ultimately see out there in the future. ","Steve Strah","Shar, this is Steve. Just to put a little finer point on that. Our next required funding requirement is in 2022 and that looks to be $240 million.","Shahriar Pourreza","And just lastly on JCP&L and sort of the transmission opportunity there. As you guys look to roll to formula rates, can you just remind us if that makes deploying capital more attractive or you\u2019re sort of already had that full run rate there? So is there opportunities to deploy additional capital by going to formula rates?","Chuck Jones","I think formula rates obviously are our preferred mechanism. They provide the benefit of being very transparent to investors, very transparent to customers and regulators. I think they clearly result in a return of cash based -- both return on and return of capital investment in a more timely fashion to allow additional reinvestment back into future projects. So we talked about what we have planned for 2020 in JCP&L. But as we go forward, obviously, I think transmission formula rates are our preferred mechanism, and we will have now pretty much all of our company except for the former Allegheny transmission system on formula rates once FERC approves us. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the more detailed assumptions embedded in the guidance, especially for '20. What are you thinking about with respect to the decoupling filing in Ohio? I suppose, how are you thinking about reflecting that in '20 to the extent to which it is already? I guess that that might be more of a risk reduction profile than the earnings impact, but I'd be curious. And then related to that, how do you think about '19 and the inclusion? I thought there was a potential for a true-up depending on the specific timing here. If you can elaborate? ","Chuck Jones ","Well, I'll answer the last part first. I don't think it's going to have any impact on 2019. We expect to file the decoupling rates and the commission has 60 days to approve them. So, they're likely won't approve them this year, I don't think. As far as how I look at it, I think it establishes a fixed cost for the base distribution costs in Ohio. Obviously, the DCR and the Grid Mod riders are on top of that. But by establishing the fixed base, it's going to accomplish what the legislature tried to do. It allows us to continue to promote energy efficiency with our customers so that they can get the benefit of that without impacting our base revenues. ","I think you pointed out the risk piece of it. It fixes our base revenues and essentially it takes about one-third of our company and I think makes it somewhat recession-proof. So, I get a question a lot about where I'm worried about a future recession. It's 2 million customers in Ohio that this is going to help make sure that that doesn't impact us. And I think","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Are you assuming it or it's unclear? ","Chuck Jones ","Assuming what? ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","The decoupling filing in '20. ","Chuck Jones ","Yes. It will be -- I'm -- we're assuming it will get approved in 2020. Yes. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","And then related, if you can just clarify the last question just a little bit further. The funding requirement in '22 for pension is $240 million or is not? Sorry, I apologize about the back and forth, there. I just want to clarify that. ","Steve Strah ","It stands at $240 million right now based on our projections, Julien. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","How do you think about -- or let me try to back up here and not be too granular. How do you think about the overall earnings growth trajectories enabled by that level of equity funding as you kind of rethink and rebase going forward? And I know I'm not -- hopefully, I'm not getting too far ahead of your more strategic thoughts here, but I'd be curious. ","Chuck Jones ","Julien, I'm not sure I even understood that question to be honest with you. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","How do you think about rebasing on a going forward basis as you roll forward next year, given what seems like a better pension outlook? ","Chuck Jones ","I don't think it's going to affect our plans for growth in the future in any fashion, Julien. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we'll get to giving you the CAGR and our equity plans when I'm comfortable with it. To plan on a company like ours three to four years out, it's a challenging process and it involves 10 operating companies, including our transmission business, look at project by project, what they plan to execute out in 2022 and beyond. It involves a lot of analysis around things like market performance and interest rates and growth economy versus recession economy and we're doing all that right now and I learned a term in engineering school called swag. I've never been willing to apply that to what I give to you. And I'm very protective of this record that we've established of every time we've given a commitment to you in the last five years, including the commitment on a major restructuring initiative, we've hit it. And we're getting close, but it's just a complex process and as soon as we're done, we'll communicate what the future beyond 2021 looks like. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. ","Praful Mehta ","So, maybe just on the growth, if your guidance as we looked at 6% to 7% or 6% to 8% growth and you take the midpoint of that and imply what it means for 2021 and you compare it against midpoint of 2020, suggests a growth of about 5%, 5.5% between '20 and '21. So, I guess, just the slope of that growth, just wanted to check, is that just more of what it is between '20 and '21 but not an indication of long-term growth? Are you still comfortable with the 6% to 8% longer term from there? Just wanted to get any color on that would be helpful. ","Chuck Jones","Well, I think I've said twice now. I'm not going to give you what we expect our CAGR to be beyond that. But I also said, I don't think you're going to be disappointed when we ultimately do give it. ","Praful Mehta ","I'll take that. Maybe moving to the credit side, you guys mentioned that you had constructive dialog with the rating agencies. Is there, in your view, going to be a lower threshold of what is required given the improved business risk profile? And also connected to that, how do you think about the whole co-leverage at this point? Is there a certain level that you're looking to maintain as a percentage of total debt? ","Chuck Jones ","Well, I'll let the rating agency speak for themselves. We do talk with them frequently and they are very aware of our plans. As far as whole co-leverage, I wish it wasn't what it is. But at the same point, as I've discussed in the past, we are comfortable that we can deploy about $3 billion of capital investment in our transmission and distribution system. That's what's driving the growth of this company and do it in a way where we will eventually grow into a stronger balance sheet. We could deploy back some of that cash towards maybe some of the holding company debt. But I just don't think that's the right thing to do for shareholders over the long-term. So we're going to continue to take our cash investment in growth, and then, as I said, we'll tell you what that's going to look like for the future coming up soon. ","Praful Mehta ","And just one final thing, on Slide 24 of your Factbook, you have the weather-adjusted distribution deliveries and the growth rates. It looks like most of the states are negative except West Virginia, which looks like meaningfully constructive and positive, especially on the industrial side. So maybe, if you can touch on what's driving the other states and what specifically in West Virginia supporting that growth? ","Steve Strah ","This is Steve Strah. In West Virginia, the growth is primarily driven by the shale gas industry. It continues to be very resilient and seems immune to any of the discussion that we've heard about with regard to recessions or the trade tariff issue. So, West Virginia is really driven by that. Overall, as we have talked in our past, we project load growth in general, however, to be flat to slightly positive. And that's really just our six-state territory and where we see the economy going. I would also remind you that within our business plan, we take a conservative approach to these projections, and we've proven over time to be very accurate in doing it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. ","Stephen Byrd ","I just wanted to follow up on the New Jersey filing that you put in. You mentioned, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you expected a response from FERC by the end of the year. I'm just not that familiar with this process. Is this something that's fairly procedural and shouldn't be subject to link the review or are there sort of elements that could require more protracted deliberation? ","Chuck Jones ","I think it's a pretty simple case. I wouldn't see any reason that FERC couldn't act on it. ","Stephen Byrd ","Understood. And then just following up on Shar's question just in terms of the benefits there. I appreciate what you had said, Chuck, in terms of just contemporaneous return being able to redeploy more capital. Is there a greater potential for further spending in the state? Do you see -- and maybe away from this filing specifically, but just other objectives, longer-term projects or items that are sort of on your longer-term wish list that you might think about further after this filing? ","Chuck Jones ","Well, I think across our entire footprint, we have already identified about $20 billion worth of transmission projects that we believe need to be completed. So, it's just a matter of, as we look at how do we deploy nearly $3 billion of capital every year, there is a rack and stack process that we go through that prioritizes where that money is spent for the most effective benefit for customers. And if in the end, it means that we would spend more in New Jersey, we'll spend it in New Jersey, but we have formula rates in Pennsylvania and Ohio also. So, it's more how are the projects stack up that drive us where to spend. I don't think you should expect us to materially expend more capital than what we've committed to, which is around $3 billion a year. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions. ","Paul Patterson ","Just the FERC has put out a few orders in the last couple of months that seem to be oriented towards increasing competition or cost containment with respect to transmission projects sort of per quarter 1,000 sort of follow-up kind of stuff, I guess, is the best way to describe it. And as you know, there is also some procedural stuff going on with stakeholder process at PJM. And I was just wondering what your thoughts were about your perspective on these orders and these efforts? ","Chuck Jones ","Well, I think, PJM, in particular, has a very transparent process already that affects these supplemental projects. And since that's where we operate, I'll comment on that. Because it's transparent, it's caused some of the questioning that goes on. But I will tell you that the projects that we do in transmission today, about half of the money is spent on PJM RTEP projects already. So those are already projects that PJM are saying are needed for future reliability reasons. And the rest fall into the category of what I call good asset management practice. And I think for the regulator, whether that be FERC or even the state commissions, to try to get too involved in how we do asset management as a business would be a mistake, because we're the one ultimately responsible for making sure that this grid is reliable and resilient and able to perform for customers, not just today, but for the long-term and the projects that we're doing just fall into the typical asset management decisions you make when you're running a bulk electric -- a piece of the bulk electric system and a system that serves 6 million customers. ","Paul Patterson ","Okay. So generally speaking, you'll see these efforts bringing about any more competition into the space that you're currently expecting to invest in. Is that the right way to think about it? ","Chuck Jones ","Not as it relates to what we're doing at FirstEnergy. The average project size inside this $1.2 billion of transmission spend, the average project size for us outside of the RTEP projects is about a $1 million to $1.5 million. These are small projects. I can't believe anybody is going to really be interested in trying to bid them and I would point out they're competitive bid already, because we competitive bid -- if we're putting in a new circuit breaker, we competitive bid that with numerous suppliers. If we're using a contractor to do that work, we competitive bid that work. So these projects are already competitive bid. And I don't think you're going to see anybody else that has the buying power or the capability that we have to competitive bid them cheaper anyway. ","Paul Patterson ","Okay. And the other projects, you don't think are going to be subject to it either, the larger ones? ","Chuck Jones ","Some of them are already subject to that. But no, I don't see it changing significantly from the way we do business today. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. ","Michael Lapides ","I know a lot of people want to ask about 2029 guidance, but I'd actually like to focus on next year first. Your transmission guidance is actually implying a pretty low growth rate relative to the midpoint of your 2019 transmission guidance, right? Your 2019 range had about $0.85 as a midpoint, your current guidance for 2020 transmission, a couple of cents higher. Is there a significant slowdown in transmission growth if that's starting to kick in as law of big numbers starting the impact kind of the ability to grow at kind of within the range, the 6% to 8% range? I'm just curious how you're thinking about the growth at the transmission business over the next couple of years and especially into 2020 over '19? ","Jason Lisowski ","Yes, Michael, this is Jason Lisowski, Chief Accounting Officer. So you're right, in 2019, we did have a little bit of additional O&M in our stated rate at transmission companies. So that was about a penny, penny and a half of additional O&M. So that reduced the '19 from the original guidance. But as you look into 2020, you'll see in the Factbook on Page 56 that we are showing about $0.04 increase year-over-year and that's the natural transmission growth that Chuck and Steve were talking about. But we do have a little bit higher interest expense mostly at FE transmission that holding company there issuing some additional debt. So we have some additional interest there. ","Michael Lapides ","And then when you think about rate base growth in transmission, do you think rate base growth in the transmission business is a 6% to 8% level or is it even higher than that? ","Chuck Jones ","It's higher than that. I think in the 10% to 11% range. ","Michael Lapides ","And then one last thing for cash flow. Can you remind us going forward what if any cash payments do you have to make to the FES stayed effectively over the next couple of years? As part of the original settlement there, what's left? ","Steve Strah ","Michael, this is Steve Strah. We have a $225 million payment that's due to FES upon emergence. We will also at that time issue a tax note that will be due in 2022 for $628 million. That's our current plan and those are the commitments that have already been subject to being made public. So we're just going to continue to follow the agreement. ","Michael Lapides ","Got it. And can you walk me through how the cash flow in the accounting metrics for the tax note will work? ","Jason Lisowski ","Yes. Michael, this is Jason Lisowski again. So that's going to be issued as a note, and then once it's paid, that's when it will come through. So it's obviously non-cash until we actually pay it in 2022. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your questions. ","Charles Fishman ","Thank you. Just one question. Corporate other up about 10% '20 over '19. I see what the Factbook says. Missing in the Factbook is any general corporate expenses. So, I'm making the assumption that the downsizing with respect to FES is going -- or went to plan. And then, any more color you can provide on those other two bullet points on the Factbook, the income tax rate going higher and looks like higher interest expense too? Thank you. ","Jason Lisowski ","Yes. Charles, this is Jason Lisowski again. So our corporate O&M expenses really predominantly get allocated out to the distribution and transmission. So only think really left at corporate is any tax planning initiatives that we have and the holding company interest. And so to your point on '19 to '20, we did have a little bit of a tax benefit, some discrete items as we got the tax return for '18 finalized in '19. We're not expecting those types of benefits to go forward. So you are seeing a little bit higher the tax rate and a hurt, if you will, '19 to '20, from the effective tax rate. ","Charles Fishman ","And what about interest expense? That was listed in the Factbook. ","Jason Lisowski ","Yes. So, the interest expense is just related to our holding company debt. ","Charles Fishman ","More debt, higher rates or? ","Chuck Jones ","No. It wouldn't be more debt. I mean, interest rates are fairly flat, if not going lower from the term loan. So, I'd have to actually go in and take a look to find out what's driving it. ","Charles Fishman ","Okay. But the important thing is we shouldn't expect that kind of acceleration going forward? ","Chuck Jones ","Not at all. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions. ","Paul Fremont ","Thanks. If I look back to your second quarter disclosure, it looked as if you were expecting sort of the underfunded pension position to improve by roughly $500 million. Is the update today should we assume that, that $500 million improvement does not take place at least for at the end of this year? ","Chuck Jones ","I'm not sure what you're looking at in the second quarter disclosures, Paul, but... ","Paul Fremont ","I think, you go from 77% funded, this is Slide 59 of the second quarter Factbook, to 82% funded in 2019. And now it looks like, I think from your disclosure or from what you were saying on your slide, your improvement is not 82%, it's to 78%. ","Steve Strah ","So, Paul, it's Steve. So the $500 million voluntary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter is the driver. So we went from 77% at the end of '18 to 78% funded status, but the other piece of this is the pension liability increased by $1.5 billion. So we went from $9.1 billion at the end of '18 to about $10.6 billion at the end of September. ","Paul Fremont ","Right. So when you end the year, the underfunded pension should still be in the range of $2.1 billion at least based on where interest rates are today, right? ","Steve Strah ","If everything holds, the underfunded pension position will be around $2.3 billion. So, it will be up $200 million versus where we ended 2018. ","Paul Fremont ","Got it. Okay. And then on the transfer of the transmission, do you need New Jersey approval or is it purely FERC approval? ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","Good morning. This is Eileen Mikkelsen and I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. And FERC is responsible for approving the JCP&L transmission transfer to a forward formula rate. ","Paul Fremont ","Okay. So there is no New Jersey approval involved? ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","New Jersey can certainly participate in the process, but not involved in the approval of the applications. ","Paul Fremont ","And then on the decoupling in Ohio, aside from rebasing, does decoupling give you any type of assumed percentage increase on a go-forward basis or is decoupling essentially just sort of a weather assumption? ","Chuck Jones ","I think it's fixing our base rates and what it does compared to anything else is dependent on what you think is going to happen with the economy, what you think is going to happen with weather, what you think is going with happen with energy efficiency, et cetera, et cetera. So what it really does is it locks in our fixed base revenues at 2018 levels and I don't know how to compare it to anything else. So that part is going to be a certainty and then the DMR and the Grid Mod is on top of that as we make the investments that we're making in the Ohio companies. ","Paul Fremont ","Okay. But aside from going back to 2018, we should not assume percentage increases on a go forward basis associated with that? ","Chuck Jones ","No. It's going to fix them until our next base distribution rate case in Ohio. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your questions. ","Andrew Weisel ","My first question is on rate cases. The Factbook now shows that you're continuously reviewing considerations for rate cases in New Jersey and West Virginia. That's a bit of a change in the wording. Are you intending to signal a change in the messaging and maybe any high level thoughts on when those next rate cases might come in those two states? ","Chuck Jones ","I wasn't intending to signal anything but I'll have Eileen update you on what we're looking at as far as future rate cases. ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","Thanks, Chuck. This is Eileen Mikkelsen and again really as it states in the Factbook, we are continuously reviewing the investments that we're making in our jurisdictions, the recovery associated with those investments and using that information to make our best judgments about when it's appropriate to file for future rate cases. ","Andrew Weisel ","Okay. So you're not suggesting that it might come sooner, given the change in wording. Is that fair? ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","I think the change in wording was really trying to be more precise about the process we use to make that evaluation. ","Andrew Weisel ","Good to hear. Then second, I'm hoping you could help me reconcile some of the guidance updates. Again, in the Factbook here, it looks like you -- on the transmission side, you increase your rate base forecast by around 2%, but the CapEx figures are unchanged. And then it's sort of the opposite on distribution where the CapEx numbers are now at the high-end of the prior ranges, yet the rate base forecasts have actually come down a little bit. Can you maybe just walk us through how to reconcile those two things that seem a little bit at odds? ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","This is Eileen Mikkelsen. We did an evaluation as we always do looking at rate base and particularly as it relates to West Virginia and Maryland, we refined our assumptions, our separation studies associated with accumulated deferred income taxes as well as the distribution versus transmission assets. So that's what you see is kind of that re-racking and stacking associated with that further refinement of that analysis. ","Andrew Weisel ","So, certain assets were switched basically from one rate base to a different rate base? Eileen Mikkelsen - FirstEnergy Corp. As well as certain balances associated with accumulated deferred income taxes, yes. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. ","Sophie Karp ","Just one conceptually to ask you about how as the regulatory mechanisms evolve across a few of your jurisdictions, you're moving transmission in New Jersey to similar rates, there is decoupling in Ohio. If that makes may be capital allocation to these distribution utilities, do these jurisdictions are really more attractive versus transmission growth in the longer term? ","Chuck Jones","Well, I think we're deploying capital where it's best fit to serve our customers better. And it right now out of average, call it $3 billion. About $1.2 billion of that is in transmission, $1.8 billion is in distribution. I don't think you're going to see that change a lot, but we clearly do prefer very transparent rate mechanisms. We mentioned on the call that we just filed another long-term infrastructure plan in Pennsylvania. The DCR and the Grid Mod in Ohio are very transparent riders. We have utilized the new rider in New Jersey for the first time starting last year and then we have transmission formula rates. And that $3 billion, a little over 60% of that is being deployed in these mechanisms that are very transparent and return cash back to the business quicker for reinvestment. ","Sophie Karp ","And on Maryland, real quick, smaller part of the overall picture, but what are your thoughts on -- are you going to participate in the potential multi-year rate filings there? ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","This is Eileen Mikkelsen. And we have been actively participating in those stakeholder discussions relative to the multi-year rate plan rules in Maryland. We expect those final rules to be issued beginning of 2020 and then we'll evaluate the application of those to our Maryland distribution utility at that time. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. ","Michael Lapides ","Two questions. These are a little bit housekeeping, probably Steve-oriented. One, what's the tax rate for income statement purposes you're embedding in guidance for 2020 and how should we think about whether you're paying cash taxes? That's the first question. And then a follow-up, coming back on the Transmission thing, you're -- I'm looking at Slide 13, you're forecasting 11% rate base growth CAGR but you're forecasting EPS growth of, like not quite 5%. I'm just trying to true-up, is all of that just intermediate holding company leverage that's weighing on that growth or is there something else in there in 2020 I'm not thinking about? ","Jason Lisowski ","Yes. Michael, this is Jason. So on your first question, if you look at Slide 56 of the Factbook in the lower right-hand corner, we note what our assumed consolidated and business unit segment tax rates. So we're expecting in 2020 to be around 21% to 24%. I'll just also mentioned that Charles had a question on the corp other, the interest expense that's increasing, that's predominantly because of that FES note that $628 million that will be issued upon their emergence. So we're assuming that will be issued at the end of this year, so we'll have that interest cost next year. And then going back on the cash taxpayer, we right now do not expect to be a federal cash taxpayer through at least 2024. ","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. ","Gregg Orrill ","In Ohio, where do you stand versus achieving the energy efficiency mandates from the legislation? And secondly, are there any additional details around the timing of the FES re-emergence process? ","Chuck Jones ","Eileen will take the first half and I'll take the second. ","Eileen Mikkelsen ","Thank you, Chuck. With respect to the energy efficiency standards, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio recently released a report really suggesting that all the utilities in the state were very close to that target and in fact opened up a comment period to seek comments from folks relative to what happens when we achieve that House Bill 6 mandated 17.5% level. ","Chuck Jones ","And as far as the FES process goes, it's not our process at this point. The court approved the restructuring plan. Every aspect of it as it affects FirstEnergy has been clarified. But what they've said is they expect to get the nuclear licenses transferred yet this year and emerge yet this year. ","Operator","Thank you. So thank you all. We\u2019d had a greater quarter. Look forward to seeing you all next week at EEI. Take care. ","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."]}}
