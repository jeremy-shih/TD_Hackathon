As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Merilee Raines, Chief Financial Officer; and Pete Levine, Director, Investor Relations.","IDEXX would like to prefix the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that statements that members of IDEXX management may make on this call regarding management\u2019s future expectations and plans and IDEXX\u2019s future prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as expects, may, anticipates, intends, would, will, plans, believes, estimates, should and similar words and expressions. Such statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding management\u2019s expectations for financial results for future periods.","Listeners are reminded that actual results could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in IDEXX\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 in the section captioned risk factors which are on file with the SEC and also available on IDEXX\u2019s website idexx.com.

Also during this call, we will discuss certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A definition of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our earnings release which can be found on our website idexx.com.","Finally, we plan to end today\u2019s call by 10 am eastern. In order to allow, broad participation in the Q&A we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please free to back into the queue and if time permits we will be more than happy to take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Merilee Raines. Please go ahead.","Merilee Raines","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth quarter, our revenues of $307.2 million yielding 7% organic growth were largely in line with our expectations at the time of our third quarter call. And earnings per share of $0.67 were about four pennies above our thinking.","As we had expected, revenue growth in our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostic business abated from previous quarters and was the driver for the 1% lower organic growth than the 8% that we experienced in the first three quarters of the year. The earnings favorability was primarily driven by a $3 million milestone payment related to sale in late 2008 of our feline diabetes therapeutic. This contributed just over three pennies to EPS, slightly lower share count was a minor secondary factor in EPS favorability.","Let me speak for moment on the economic backdrop for our Companion Animal business. Recent data showing a modest improving trend in certain aspects of the US economy are reflected as well in our fourth quarter metrics from a subset of nearly 500 veterinary clinics using our Cornerstone Practice Management System. Patient visits were up about 1% in the fourth quarter and this is versus flat in the third quarter and down 0.5% in the first half of the year. And practice revenues grew by 3.5% which was up 50 basis points from the third quarter and up about 150 basis points from the first half.","Despite the turmoil in the European economy, our Companion Animal business in Europe achieved 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. While we remain cautious along with others about the predictive reliability of short-term data and the negative impacts to global economy from potential further shocks occurring in any one geography such as Europe. We nonetheless feel that the metrics we are observing support the assumption in our 2012 outlook that our businesses will benefit modestly from a very gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment.","Now for some further detail on revenue performance for some of our businesses. VetLab Instruments and Consumables with fourth quarter revenue of $102.4 million grew 6% organically. Sales of instruments were $28.7 million and organic growth up 2%. Worldwide placements of Catalyst were up 13% year-to-year marked by solid performance in the US and on the international front, strong placements in Asia Pacific due in part to the launch in Japan offset relatively flat placements in Europe.","For the year, our combined chemistry placements of VetTest and Catalyst were within a couple of percentage points of our goal of 4000. ProCyte and LaserCyte hematology placements increased by 12% over prior year. ProCyte continues to be a significant contributor to our growth. With 381 units installed in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 1,179 placements, nearly 20% above our 2011 goal of 1000 units.","Despite the strength of ProCyte, LaserCyte remains an appealing choice for many and the fourth quarter placements were consistent with last year. Approximately two-thirds of these LaserCyte units have been traded in our ProCyte sales and certified for resale, which is an economically attractive option for both us and for our customers.","Approximately 30% of our Catalyst and ProCyte sales were to new and competitive accounts. Once again, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in the number of SmartService users with over 1,300 installations in the fourth quarter. This brings our active installed base to over 12,000 customers. A continued activation of SmartService has helped drive our success with testing protocol rebate programs in North America and we will support the use of similar programs in other regions.","In addition, SmartService allows us to improve the customer experience with our analyzers by proactively managing instrument field service and downloading software enhancements over the internet. Our Instrument Consumable revenue of $62.5 million grew organically 9% and changes in distributor inventory level has an immaterial impact on year-to-year organic growth.","Our fourth quarter growth is in line with what we saw throughout 2011. As we have noted, the use of protocol-based rebate programs has enhanced our success in placing instruments, the primary contributor to consumable growth. These programs resonate with customers because they are aligned with the veterinarian\u2019s desire to practice best medicine while providing a way that is intuitive to them to fund their capital purchase by using rebates to cover monthly lease payments.","Under these programs, the most significant portion of the rebate is attributed to the consumable sale. This is a change from other programs where discounts are attributed to instrument sales. I mentioned that as expansion of these rebate programs will have a slight negative impact on year-to-year consumable revenue growth rates, accordingly for 2012 we expect normalized organic growth for instrument consumables to be about on par with 2011 as growth and volume is muted by price in large part due to the change in the structure of our marketing program.","In the fourth quarter, our rapid assay sales of $35.4 million grew organically by 14%, when normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, revenues grew by 8%. This compares to the 2% normalized growth for the first three quarters of the year. A little more than half of the step up in growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a US price increase that went into effect on October the 1st. The first price increase on our canine parasitic panels, 3 and 4Dx since 2008. Additionally we've picked up a point of growth from the continued successful ramp of our snap feline pancreatitis test which was launched in the second quarter.","In the US canine parasitic disease testing volumes and feline testing volumes also showed a slight up tick from the first nine months. We believe this is in part reflective of the improved patient visit metrics and is related to canine testing, successful execution of marketing programs.","Our expectation for 2012 is to see normalized growth rates in the range of 4% for the Rapid Assay business, which is about on par with a normalized organic growth for the full year 2011. We anticipate that growth will be stronger in the first half and then moderate as we anniversary price increases and product launches.","US distributor inventory for instrument consumables and rapid assays averaged a little under four weeks at the end of the fourth quarter based on forward-looking demand, which is within their normal and customary range.","Our Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services business, with revenues of $91.7 million achieved reported growth of 13% in the fourth quarter, which translated to 10% organic growth for both the quarter and the year. Growth was strong across all regions with the majority of the growth coming from higher test volumes driven primarily by the addition of new customers. A slight improvement in same-store volumes and increasing adoption of panels and incorporate our innovative specialty test also contributed to the increased volume.","Acquisitions contributed just over 2.5% of the 13% growth in the quarter. Notably in the fourth quarter we acquired RADIL research and diagnostic testing laboratory in early November and ALX Laboratory in early December. RADIL serves bioresearch market with in-house monitoring and diagnostic testing services. The combination of Radil with our small existing presence in this market will enable us to provide a comprehensive diagnostic solution to bioresearch customers, addressing both reference laboratory and in-house testing needs.","The acquisition of ALX will also enable us to accelerate our expansion in the sizeable Manhattan veterinary market with an established presence and an existing customer base. ALX is co-located with Animal Medical Center who are the largest animal hospital in the world with a national reputation as a leader in animal healthcare.","While we are in the early days the integration is going well in both of these acquisitions and both have performed in line with expectations during the quarter. In addition to these acquired labs we opened two new data labs in the quarter in support of our goal of acquiring new customers and strengthen service level, one in Nashville, Tennessee and the other near Milan, Italy. This brings our total global network to 56 labs up from 48 at the end of the 2010.","Throughout 2011 we also continued to invest in the area of electronic connectivity between our customers and our laboratories. With additional enhancement to our web based test ordering and result delivery systems that connect, nearly 60% of our customers in the US are now submitting electronically generated test requisition.","That connect worked seamlessly with clinical practice information management system to improve work flow and easy of use of the clinic and to drive meaningful operational and productivity improvement at our labs.","Information technology investment such as this along with lab technology developments, LEAN and 6-Sigma processing, global purchasing contracts and volume leverage will continue to drive margin expansion in our reference labs over the next several years.","As we look forward to 2012, we expect organic growth for Labs and Consulting Services will continue at about 10%, driven primarily by an increase in volumes coming from footprint expansion, increased penetration of our specialty task and modest benefits from an improving economy.","Our Practice Information Management and Digital Radiography System with revenues up $21.8 million, grew organically 5% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year, performance consistent with our expectations as we entered the quarter. Strong order volume attributed in part to the seasonal pattern for fourth quarter capital equipment investments resulted in a solid backlog entering 2012. We expect the innovative enhancements for both product lines along with increasing industry appreciation for integrated solutions will support organic growth in the high single to low double-digit range for 2012.","Our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostic revenues declined 3% organically to $24.1 million in the fourth quarter to yield 11% organic growth for the year largely in line with our expectations.","As anticipated we experienced a decline in BSE revenues in the fourth quarter resulting from the new EU rule that was effective July 1, 2011 that increased the mandatory testing age requirements for BSE from 48 months to 72 months.","We also saw a moderate decline in revenues associated with the bovine testing programs in Germany, driven by difficult comparison, as these programs ramped significantly in fourth quarter of 2010. We anticipate that growth in 2012 will be in the mid-to-low single digit range due to a couple of factors. First, we believe that the bovine testing programs in Germany have completed their ramp. Second, we expect further price and volume declines for BSE test. Growth in 2012 will reflect continued expansion in developing market in Asia and Latin America.","Our Water business had sales of $20 million for the quarter, which translated into 4% organic growth. This growth was in line with our expectations and resulted in 5% organic growth for the full-year. We expect growth in Water for 2012 to be in the mid-single digit range, reflecting growth in North America driven by volume gains from account acquisition and penetration of the waste water testing market, as well as growth in our core Colilert testing business in Europe.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, growth margin at 52% was largely consistent with our expectations. Operating expenses at 34% of revenues were slightly below our thinking in October, reflecting the $3 million milestone payment that I described earlier, which is netted against operating expenses in the G&A line.","Operating expenses were normalized for this item at 35% of revenue, were in line with our expectations in October. Our effective tax rate of 30.5% was in line with our expectations and in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter we were able to release reserves in conjunction with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. Share count was slightly below our expectations in October reflecting somewhat higher repurchase activity in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with a $184 million of cash and $246 of debt for a net debt position of $62 million. As expected our inventory balance of $133 million was approximately $4 million lower than the level at the end of the third quarter, due largely due to the timing of chemistry consumer board receipts. ","DSO at 41 days remains in good shape and our free cash flow was $47 million or 123% of net income.","As we look forward to 2012, we project revenues to be between $1.3 and $1.31 billion. The decrease of $5 million to the high end of our range relative to the guidance provided at the time of our October earnings call is the result of the negative impact of currency, partially offset by the impact of the fourth quarter lab acquisitions. The increase of $5 million at the low end of our range reflect these factors, as well as the tightening of our guidance range by $10 million.","Our revenue guidance and price reported growth of 7% to 8%, which translates to organic growth of 8% to 9%, a 1% favorable impact due to acquisitions and a negative impact of currency, up approximately 2%. Organic growth of 8% to 9% compares to the 8% we achieved in 2011. We expect that the momentum that we have in our Companion Animal Group businesses will more than offset lower organic growth for livestock and poultry diagnostics for 2012. Implicit in our revenue guidance is a modest contribution of perhaps 0.5% to 1% from a gradual improvement in the economy.","We expect the full year gross margin to be approximately 54% about 100 basis points above the 2011 full year rate. The continuation of targeted initiatives in our two largest businesses, IDEXX VetLab and Reference Laboratories will help lead margin expansion and will manifest primarily in the gross margin line. We expect gross margin in the first quarter to be somewhat higher than the full year average due primarily to product mix and manufacturing volume favorability.","Operating expenses should average out to be between 34% and 35% for the full year. This spending level is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011 when you exclude the favorable $3 million impact of the pharma related payment. The moderate increase over the full year 2011 reflects planned investments in product, service and information technology innovation, as well as commercial initiatives globally that support our revenue growth in 2012 and beyond.","We expect the operating margin to be between 19% and 20%. This reflects about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion when you adjust 2011 to remove the favorable impact of the pharma payments received both in the third quarter and fourth quarters which totaled about $4 million for the year.","We expect the tax rate to be between 31.5% and 32% for the full year. Our projected tax rate is approximately 50 to 100 basis points higher mid-2011, primarily due to the fact that we have not incorporated the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit into our 2010 rate.","Net interest expense should be approximately $3 million and weighted average share count should be down 3% to 4% from the full year 2011 level. The annual reduction of share count is higher than the 2% to 3% we have been averaging in prior years due to largely to the impact on 2012 of the step-up and repurchase activity in the second half of 2011.","All of this leads us to 2012 EPS guidance of $3.04 to $3.10. We are maintaining the high end of guidance range as we anticipate $0.03 of negative impact due to currency relative to rates at the time of our October earnings call will be offset by the favorable impact of a slight lower tax rate and lower share count as just mentioned. The increase of $0.04 at the low end of our range reflects these factors as well as the increase in the low end of our revenue range.","For a little more detail on currency, the rate implicit in our guidance are, the Euro at a $1.25, the pound at $1.53 and the Canadian dollar at $0.97. For 2012, every 1% strengthening of the US dollar vis-\u00e0-vis our basket of currencies reduces revenues by approximately $4.5 million and operating profit by about $800,000 on an annual basis.","The projected impact of currency changes has increased slightly from our previous estimate reflecting the growth of our international business. We project free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jon for some further comments on the business.","Jon Ayers","Okay, thank you Merilee. We\u2019re pleased with how our 2011 wrapped up as a company and the momentum we have going into 2012. As Merilee mentioned, our outlook for 2012 incorporates a very modest pickup in economic activity in our CAG businesses consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter. Again, we remain cautious about an outlook that would be any more than 0.5% to 1% improvement in practice visit trends over the 2011 levels.","Having said that, our momentum comes from continued unique innovations that we bring for the market including our Real-Time Care offerings with in-house diagnostics differentiates Reference Lab Services and new and expanded information technology products and services.","A key thing in early 2012 was the introduction of new menu on our existing diagnostic platforms. In the Rapid Assay business we expect to launch an expanded Canine Vector-borne Disease Screening SNAP, we call 4Dx Plus. Launch timing is subject to USDA approval which we would expect in the early Q2. SNAP 4Dx Plus is able to detect two additional tick-borne diseases added to the four Vector-borne diseases including Heartworm that we already cover with SNAP 4Dx.","In total 4Dx Plus will detect diseases that can be carried by total four different tick-species, dogs for most of the country exposed to some, if not all of the species and the bacterial diseases that they can transmit. SNAP 4Dx Plus will replace 4Dx at the same price, giving our customers more value for their money and greater ability to detect patients with multiple simultaneous infections and important clinical finding. We believe that the standard-care continues to shift slowly from Heartworm only testing to full annual Vector-borne disease screening.","Moving on to the IDEXX VetLab suite, we\u2019ll also be launching in April a viable new test on our highly successful Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer. This is tested measures for levels of phenol-barbital, a standard therapy used to control seizure in dogs. Virtually, every practice has patients on Phenobarbital and our test is critical in determining if the dosage is within and not above or below the therapeutic range for the patient.","While the test itself will not be a significant revenue generator to IDEXX in the context of the volume chemistry consumable sold in the market, it will create another differentiator for the customer to use Catalyst and indeed entire integrated IDEXX VetLab suite as their in-house lab solution.","In our Reference Labs, our mini additions will include the lab version of 4Dx Plus which is popular with customers who prefer to use Reference Labs for their Vector-borne disease screening protocol. In addition in the Reference Labs, we\u2019ve added five new Real PCR test to our canine and feline diarrhea panels; continue to bring new innovation in the area of molecular diagnostics for Companion Animal Medicine.","Turning to our Companion Animal business in Europe, we\u2019re impressed with the 8% organic growth in this region achieved in Q4 in a period marked by a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty. Our team in Europe brings tremendous experience to the different country markets.","In addition, these markets appear to be even earlier in their development in the US and thus have momentum to help offset the macroeconomic issues. We continue to make investments in Europe to expand our commercial sales organization and Reference Labs footprint, and for example, we added the lab in Italy in Q4.","Moving to Asia, we\u2019re very pleased to have received approval to market ProCyte in Japan. The combination of Catalyst, ProCyte and the IDEXX VetLab station will be sort of game-changer in Japan over the longer term and this is a market that generally prefers in-house equipment solution to lab services for core chemistry and hematology testing. We expect the full launch of ProCyte in Japan to occur in Q2.","Finally, I wanted to give you an update on the process of the FTC investigation, as we understand it. As we\u2019ve said all along, we can\u2019t predict when and how the investigation will be concluded. For example, last summer we thought the FTC staff was nearing the conclusion of this investigation, but staff required additional information. So it\u2019s just very difficult to predict. But our sense at this time is that most of the FTC staff fact finding is done and that the FTC is working through its internal processes to determine whether or not to file a complaint against IDEXX in the Administrative Law Court within the FTC or to close the investigations without taking any action.","Ultimately, the decision of whether to file a complaint or not is made by the Commissioners of the FTC and not the staff. We do not know exactly when the Commissioners will make this decision, but we suspect it might be sometime in the next several months.","As a reminder, if the Commissioners decided to proceed with a complaint, we would litigate in the Administrative Law Court and my understanding that this litigation typically takes about nine months; or we do have an adverse ruling, we would have the opportunity to appeal a decision to the Commission and where that appeal fail, we would have the opportunity to appeal the Commission decision to the Federal Appeals Court of our choosing.","All of these proceedings could take a couple of years in total and during that period it would be business as usual for us. We remain confident about our legal positions for many reasons, including our prior success in two Federal Courts in which the legality of our distributor agreements was litigated. So while we are hopeful that the investigation will be closed without action, we\u2019re fully prepared to defend ourselves in the FTC and beyond if necessary and we feel that our legal position is very strong.","So in summary, we have an economic environment with very modest growth, a competitive environment in the diagnostics space that is ever intensified. This is a natural progression of markets to have attracted demand characteristics and opportunities for technological innovation. Of course, we bring and our competition expands the adoption of new innovations when they come to the market with imitation and our goal is to continue to be the leader in bringing innovations to the market, in part by bringing new levels of differentiation and value to build upon our existing offerings and thus driving organic growth revenue for the market and for the company as a whole.","An example of that we've talked about just in this call of course are the vector-borne disease screening expansion with 4Dx Plus, real-time care with both 4Dx and pheno-barbital test and the expanded molecular diagnostics offerings that we are offering in the lab. So, Cynthia with that I would like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Let me ask a quick one on the in-house protocol agreement program. It sounds like you are continuing to see that as a very successful strategy to place equipment and I am curious if you have data yet on what that does post placement for the consumable utilization, so anyway to compare that to an existing customer utilization or maybe that utilization versus the real-time protocol rebates.","Jon Ayers","Yeah Ryan, I say we are probably a little early on that, but of course we do have data on what happens when VetTest customer goes to a Catalyst customer or when a Catalyst customer adds ProCyte and those generally of course increase the utilization and we've got a little bit more runway on those to really have an analytical approach to that. The other thing that we are seeing that is interesting is ProCyte is when combined with Catalyst is going into larger accounts.","In fact the average chemistry utilization of a combined ProCyte Catalyst placement is close to 50% or 45% higher than the average of our Catalyst installed base that does have ProCyte Dx. So there is a lot dynamics going on here, but I think we are pleased with the quality of the placements and all the different initiatives which are driving utilization and ultimately of course growth in the Consumable volumes and revenues.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","I guess a quick second question on how [Bob], just a little bit more color if you could on the R&D spend. I think it was up about 16% year-over-year which is the biggest uptick we\u2019ve seen in a number of years. So a couple of questions there just, can you talk a little bit about that outlook as a percent of sales going forward. Do you expect that to stay at current levels and then maybe you could discuss some of the priorities, be it platform consumables, IT et cetera that you are currently focused on as we look forward on the R&D front?","Merilee Raines","Ryan, I\u2019ll answer for the first question. I think the R&D levels as a percentage of revenue we see, expect in 2012 will be pretty consistent with what they were in 2011.","Jon Ayers","And Ryan, you got it. We\u2019re going to be expanding you know the diagnostic menu, the capability consistent with real-time care and differentiated lab services which we really think are just different variations of providing, of serving the diagnostic market in general and of course if you think about diagnostics, what are they? They are really information and medical decision support and so the information technology are strategies that we have to both enhance the value of diagnostics and in fact help the veterinarians improve you know the patient traffic and the revenue per patient visit by helping them communicate the value of their services is really consistent with our overall strategy. So as we have advancements to talk about as we have done in this quarter, each quarter we will let you know. But we obviously have expanded the R&D because we think there is the opportunity in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Just a couple of kind of OUS questions for me, I guess the first one, given the launch of ProCyte and Catalyst Dx in Japan, how big of a market is that currently for you guys on the companion animal side and how penetrated do you think you are in the market?","Jon Ayers","Yeah. Well of course we did launch Catalyst, a controlled launch in Q3 and of course grew that in Q4. We won\u2019t be launching ProCyte although we are still in a lot of laser sites. But we won\u2019t be launching ProCyte until Q2 but it will be a great accommodation. There is really nothing like a ProCyte in the Japanese market and it was kind of ironic here is that ProCyte of course is manufactured in Japan. So it\u2019s got the kind of technology that Japanese really appreciate.","It\u2019s obviously a lot smaller market than the US primarily because obviously a small economy and less pet ownership. But that doesn\u2019t make it a very substantial market. There are 8000 veterinary practices. There although, many of them are smaller. But I think what\u2019s interesting for us is that in Japan we have a relatively small share in relation to other countries that we are in. We have a very experienced management team there and actually we have been in Japan for two decades.","And we have sold instruments, but we really think it is going to just be a whole new game when we add ProCyte. The Catalyst is itself a new game, but then we add the hematology to it and again, they really do most of their hematology test, chemistry test and hematology in-house although most of it is not done with our equipment.","So we do see a long-term expansion opportunity if not, you know, it\u2019s just one more attractive market in our portfolio of international markets.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","","Okay, and then the 8% growth in Europe, that\u2019s pretty impressive given the challenges that we\u2019re seeing over there. Has this been fairly consistent during 2011 and what are you expecting in Europe in 2012?","Jon Ayers","","Well, we had, if I recall correctly off the top of my head, we have 10% organic growth in Q3 and of course that was a period that had some economic turmoil and then 8% in Q4 and I was just over with our entire European sales team and they\u2019re really very excited about the opportunity going into 2012 and the context of course of economic uncertainty. I don\u2019t know if with regard to it, I think it\u2019s really with the component of our overall organic growth guidance.","Merilee Raines","","I would just say, David, that as we\u2019re looking at things and seeing a combination of both, the momentum we have in the market and the different levels of market penetration that we have in different geographies that, we\u2019re just expecting pretty strong growth across all the regions for 2012. I don\u2019t think there is any one area that\u2019s driving growth significantly more than another area.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova with Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","","Let me start with just the comment on the competitive environment. It seems like the instrument revenue growth of at least in dollar terms was a little bit slower than it has been in prior quarters. I guess I was wondering if there is anything that struck you there that will slower your expectations and also if you could please guide us into John\u2019s commentary about the environment getting tougher competitively, [boxes] are out actually promoting their strategy that having the reference lab helps them drive instrument placements. I guess I was wondering if you could respond to that, how you respond to this competitively? Is it making any impact to you?","Merilee Raines","Miroslava, I will just speak for a moment on the instrument revenue growth. I think we characterized that placements and how we felt about those and you know I think again I will just reiterate that you know. As far as the placements were, they were I think I would characterize as solid in the US and then in Europe they were a little bit lower than in the US and another geographies and Asia was a little bit stronger albeit a smaller market.","I think some of the factor that is driving a lower organic revenue growth is the fact that it is a competitive market and we are finding that our marketing programs do involve discounts. I talked about discounts on instrument consumables, but they also are requiring discounts on instruments and I think the placements I guess I would summarize and say we are feeling good about the placements. We are pleased with the double-digit growth that we had both for chemistry and hematology for our largest instruments and the somewhat lower AUPs that we have via discount are something that is helping us to achieve the placement levels that we have.","Jon Ayers","And Miroslava, its an entire business model. So you've got the instrument placements and of course the instrument revenues, you have consumable. We are pleased to see that the quality of our consumable growth is entirely volume-related. We think that's a good, strong strategic dimension to our business and then we've put our cost reductions in there and you put the whole thing together we are able to get the top line growth and the margin expansion in the instrument business and continue to innovate. And of course people are going to come when they can and follow and try to copy innovations that's the nature of these markets and yet we are continuing to lead the way with new levels of differentiations.","I think one of the things that we are very pleased about for example with our catalyst and our ProCyte install base is the loyalty and the retention of our customers when they start using these technologies is extraordinarily high. They really value them when we put them in place and I mean its impressive. So that's another thing that makes us feel good about the long-term prospects for growth in this business.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up, the operating expenses as a percentage of sales, guidance that Merilee gave for next year is probably a little bit higher than what I would have thought. I appreciate you are making some significant investments there.  Maybe if you could give us some color on what exactly are you investing in?","Merilee Raines","Well, I am not going to get into a lot of specifics on that, the two primary areas will be within RD. And then within sales and marketing it is largely related to commercial activities. There are some infrastructure investments that we are looking to make internationally. We are also continuing to make investments in our commercial sales force in the US. So I think its really across the globe in a variety of different things.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Okay, great thank you and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your lines is open.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks and good morning. Some of my question have been already asked. I guess if can follow up here as well. John you mentioned the slight step down from 10% to 8% in CAG but again the number considering the environment was pretty good. Can you just maybe give us some more detail on the type of customer over there in Europe?","And what I mean by that is wellness testing as prevalent in Europe or is it not, and it its not, does give you a little bit more of a cushion those growth rates because maybe the testing environment would be therefore less discretionary than what we might see here in the US?","Jon Ayers","John, that is an excellent insight and we do believe that, so called wellness testing or what we would preferred to call it as a preventative testing is really at a very, very low utilization versus the US. And its really the way that vet schools we thought of course were trying to shift the market but there is a much higher mix, if you will of sick animal or chronic care type of testing that\u2019s on our testing to confirm a diagnosis.","So that\u2019s one of the reasons why I said I believe this markets are earlier in their development and also of less discretionary as a result. Also the other thing that we are finding in Europe and I mentioned this generally but certainly it has been very true in Europe, is that with a combination of Catalyst and now ProCyte, we are actually getting into some large accounts that we really previously didn\u2019t have, a great reason to get their attention.","A Catalyst was very nice, many of these accounts have vet chemistry, which is a technology that works very well on high volume, but it didn\u2019t capture their attention but with ProCyte where there nothing like it in the hematology. We are capturing the attention and we are getting the whole suite and I think that is helping too. That\u2019s one of the market opportunities that we are capturing and of course the other thing is we are expanding our lab business in Europe.","We have not crucially been in all the countries. Now we are in Italy, we weren\u2019t in Italy before, even though we have had very strong commercial organization in Italy. That has done very well and so when we add lab to that commercial organization, they get very excited. We did that previously in France and Spain. We have a very, very strong operation in Germany in lab, which actually serves a whole bunch of countries surrounding Germany and those services are expanding. So the combination of the instrument business and lab business appear to have excellent momentum in Europe.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, great. Thanks for that color. May be just one more question that might have a couple of parts to it, but the organic growth in Rapid Assay was a big number. It seems like Merilee almost half the growth rate was a sell-in to the distributors. So I just want to make sure I heard it correctly, may be a couple of million dollars was a sell through in to the distributors on the Rapid Assay form, but there was a normalized level of inventory on the consumables. So, I guess that\u2019s sort of is just a clarification.","And then in the second part to the question would just be Jon, why aren\u2019t you taking price on 4Dx Plus if you would? Maybe if not today, that\u2019s something that you might roll out in a couple of quarters. Thanks guys.","Merilee Raines ","","Well, first let me just kind of clarify or walk through the components of the organic growth. Again, so, organic growth 14%; 6% of that it was attributed to changes in to distributor inventory levels year-to-year. And then so the adjusted growth and normalized growth, which is what we are typically looking at was 8%.","Jon Ayers","","Right. So, 8% I think is the right number. To answer your question, of course we did take a price increase in 4Dx in October, as Merilee had mentioned. But we really think the opportunity to grow the utilization of Vector-borne disease screening is a bigger opportunity than to realize price. So, interestingly, there are 70 million plus dogs in the US and not all of them are going to a veterinary clinic unfortunately. 35 million of them are on some kind of heartworm preventative and only 21 million of them are roughly, these are all rough numbers, are tested annually for heartworm, even though it\u2019s a really recommended test before we put them on preventative. And then less than nine million of those have a heartworm test associated with the full Vector-borne disease screening, even though 75% to 80% of the dogs in the country are exposed to ticks.","So, we think that there is an opportunity to continue to expand the utilization of heartworm and in this case, Vector-borne disease screening and really so our focus is in that area with the 4Dx Plus test and of course all the medical education and support that we give with that offering.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King. Your line is open.","Ross Taylor - CL King","","I\u2019ll just have look at two topics, I wanted to ask you about. First of all did I catch from your prepared remarks that your protocol rebate programs are still relatively insignificant in Europe and related to this I just wanted to clarify. Are these programs here primarily important to you economically because they are helping your drive your instrument placements or are you actually also seeing an improvement in your chemistry and clinic revenue and your profitability for the consumer growth as well?","Jon Ayers","To answer the first question, they are really not been introduced in Europe yet. We think that maybe every country in Europe is a little different and there may be some opportunities to do so in Europe but not at this point of time. They are certainly helpful with instrument placements, they also provide a nice framework for customers to expand the utilization.","So I think that part of the story of moving to real-time care with that primary first screen, or what we call in medical profession minimum database of chemistry and hematology values is run at the point of care upon the presentation of the pet. So they provide a foundation for that. I think I answered in our early question, we are too early to really see this to be able to measure that at this point in time.","Ross Taylor - CL King","The last question is fairly minor but I noticed in your guidance some of the Fx rates you use are a little below where the current market rates are and I just wondered if there is any particular reason for that?","Merilee Raines","Well, you know I think the rates have sort of been all over the place recently and so our feeling was I don\u2019t know, you know it\u2019s typically, it just feels like with the environment that we have in Europe that you know that probably 125 is we\u2019re looking out over the years and it\u2019s good of a rate as any. And I think that\u2019s why we are hurt you know because we can\u2019t predict these things very well that we\u2019re just pretty clear about stating what our rates are and then giving the sensitivity guidance and metrics for you so you know everybody can calculate what the changes would be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Most of my questions have been answered, but I noticed that you established a relationship with one of your distributors MWI to meet demand to the Cornerstone platform and I think that starts April 1st as I recall and can you elaborate on this relationship and other opportunities or existing similar relationships with other distributors and does this offer some sort of stickiness to your model?","Merilee Raines","Yeah.","Jon Ayers","Well, we have a relationship with one of our distributors. I suspect overtime that that will grow; that allows the customers with our practice management software to have a greater level of electronic integration with the distributor. We think that was really part of the entire trend of moving to information technology to make the practices increase the standard care, in this case increase the productivity and the profitability of the practice.","So it\u2019s very exciting; and I think it brings great value to our customers who use Cornerstone and what I will tell you is that people who you know purchase practice management software, they usually keep it for very long time, I mean there is very little change in the installed base overtime of practice management software; its not a decision that you make lightly and you want to make one with somebody who is going to be in the market for a long time and continuing innovate with advanced releases.","And we haven\u2019t really spend any time in this call, but we have in past calls, we\u2019re just very excited about Cornerstone and its ability to move into electronic medical records and integration with the in-house system whether they would be diagnostics or others and with suppliers such as in the case with distribution. So I think it\u2019s just continued evolution of that connectivity that\u2019s taking place.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","On the bioresearch opportunity, I know it\u2019s still very, very small, but how can we track the performance of this business going forward?","Jon Ayers","Yeah, it\u2019s pretty small; I think we\u2019re going to have within the parts of the business, both with the Reference Lab and the point-of-care. We were very certainly very pleased with having leaded the acquisition of RADIL and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the integration today.","And indeed the performance of that business in a short term that business part of the IDEXX family and we\u2019re also very excited, you know they really had an outstanding reputation, but they were primarily, the revenue has been primarily domestic and it\u2019s really a global market and so one of the opportunities that we see in bioresearch is to expand that capability internationally.","And again, when I was in Europe with our European organization, they were excited about the opportunity to expand the bioresearch presence. But, it\u2019s so small in relation to the larger businesses I think we will be tracking as part of the larger lines of business.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Just one quick question, most of my questions been answered, but thinking about kind of placement activity for 2012, certainly you had a kind of a robust finish of 2011. I know you gave initial guidance last year kind of what you anticipated for kind of ProCyte placement growth, just may be any expectations surrounding the number of placements for \u201912 and then also with Catalyst you are several years into the placement ramp; just kind of your expectations for Catalyst placements heading into 2012? Thanks.","Merilee Raines","Hi Nick, with regard to, let me just say proudly, our hematology line, so we got LaserCyte and ProCyte, we are anticipating approximately a 15% unit growth year-to-year and for ProCyte that would kind of translate we\u2019re expecting about 1,400 placements. And as we look at our Chemistry Line, Catalyst and VetTest, we are expecting about a 5% to 10% growth across both.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Your line is open.","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti","Hi, just a quick question regarding Europe, clearly as we look at the numbers, it\u2019s now about 43% of revenue and with the investments you are planning in increasing infrastructure there, how do you see that number moving over the next couple of years?","Jon Ayers","I think the 43% is total international. And so, is the question with regard to Europe or international, in general?","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti","Overall, as Europe grows and I guess, even in Asia, how much is international sort of, become, I mean do you see it becoming 50-50 sort of over next five years or so?","Jon Ayers","You know, it\u2019s a question that I get frequently and I am certainly very, very excited about the growth internationally. But quite frankly, I am pretty excited about the growth domestically too, because the US is really going through a technology, the US market; for veterinary care it\u2019s going through an information technology revolution which is really able to change the game in terms of the pattern of the client experience, and appreciation for veterinary care.","So, while we think that the international markets are underdeveloped in relation to US market, we think the US market is underdeveloped in relation to what we\u2019re seeing leading practitioners accomplish with pet owners. And we\u2019re not talking demographics here, we\u2019re not talking geographies. We\u2019re just talking about practices who are very, very successful in communicating the value of care and having greatly expanded, therefore intensity of care, which quite frankly, lengthens the life of the pet and lowers the cost of that pet over the long-term, because you don\u2019t have as many chances for chronic or acute intervention.","And so, you know, that\u2019s a long way of answering that; I don\u2019t think those numbers will change a lot between domestically and internationally. They do change as much because of currency as they do underlying volumes in those core markets. But having said that, you know 10 years ago, I think the mix was 39% international and today the mix is 43% international. So you know, there has been some shift in that direction.","Operator","Thank you. And with that Mr. Ayers, I would like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jon Ayers","Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining the call and it being the wrap-up of 2011 I also just want to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate all of our employees. And indeed of course our customers; we wouldn\u2019t be in the market without our customers and we know we have to win our customers\u2019 confidence everyday and we look forward to continuing to do that in 2012.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian McKeon","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2020. IDEXX achieved continued strong financial performance in Q4, which supported delivery of full year revenue and EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter driven by 11% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 10% organic growth in our LPD and Water businesses. Solid fourth quarter gains supported full year organic revenue growth of over 10% and nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our full year EPS was $4.89, an increase of 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 120 basis points in comparable constant currency operating margin improvement.","Note that our comparable growth rates and comparable operating margin improvement metrics now exclude impacts from Q4 CEO transition charges. These charges reduced operating profits by $13.4 million in Q4, aligned with expectations; and EPS by $0.14 per share after tax, approximately $0.04 better than initial projections, reflecting updated tax provision estimates. Full year EPS results included $0.22 per share in tax benefit from share-based compensation activity, $0.05 per share above our guidance estimates. We also saw an additional $0.04 of below-the-line upside to our earlier guidance estimates related to final tax provision estimates and lower-than-projected interest expense.","We're well positioned to build on these strong results in 2020. We're maintaining our outlook for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth reflected in our increased guidance range of $2.620 billion to $2.655 billion in annual revenues, which include updated FX estimates. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.12 to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, reflecting 13% to 16% comparable constant currency EPS growth. Positive revisions to our preliminary guidance range reflect the flow-through of our 2019 performance with consistent operational improvement assumptions and favorable updates to projections for interest expense, share-based compensation tax benefits and FX impacts.","We'll walk you through the details of our 2020 guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results by segment. Q4 results were supported by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were up 11% organically driven by 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, net of a modest equivalent days' headwind overall. By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 10.5% organically net of a 0.5% equivalent days' impact. Consistent strong U.S. gains were supported by low- to mid-teens organic growth in reference lab sales, double-digit gains in VetLab consumables and solid gains in rapid assay revenues. U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, with net price gains trending in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintained high levels of customer retention across modalities.","U.S. CAG Diagnostics revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends. Total visits per practice were relatively flat in the quarter on a same-store basis with a 4.3% increase on overall same-store practice revenue. Total market clinical visit growth was 1.8% in Q4, following relatively strong Q3 results, with some moderation in visit gains earlier in the fourth quarter offset by stronger gains in December. For the full year, clinical same-store visit growth increased 2.5% of the 7,500 practices in our data set, up from 2.1% in 2018, reflecting continued solid market expansion in diagnostic services. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 12% organically in Q4, net of a modest overall equivalent day's headwind. International results reflected mid-teens organic growth in consumable revenues supported by a 25% year-on-year expansion in our Catalyst installed base outside of the U.S. Strong consumable gains of nearly 20% in Europe and continued strong gains in Canada and Latin America were moderated to a degree in Q4 by impacts related to the timing of shipments in Asia, which benefited Q3 2019 and prior year Q4 results as well as equivalent day impacts.","For the full year, international consumable revenues increased nearly 20% organically. International reference lab sales increased organically at consistent high single-digit rates in Q4 with solid gains across our major regions. For the full year, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased nearly 12% organically, reflecting 11% gains in the U.S. and 13% growth in international markets, aligned with our long-term goals. By modality, global reference lab and consulting services revenues expanded 11% organically in the fourth quarter supported by a nearly 1% equivalent day growth benefit with an additional 2% of reported growth benefit related to the initial integration of Marshfield Labs. Full year organic growth of 11% in lab revenues was driven by consistent strong growth in the U.S., supported by continued high same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers. Global VetLab consumable revenues grew 12% organically in Q4 net of a 1.5% equivalent day headwind. For the full year, VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically driven by double-digit growth across U.S. and international markets, supported by increases in diagnostic test utilization and ongoing expansion of our premium instruments installed base.","We had another excellent quarter in terms of high-quality instrument placements in Q4, supporting double-digit year-on-year growth in our Economic Value Index or EVI. Global premium placements increased 13% year-on-year in Q4 driven by 23% year-on-year growth in Catalyst placements, supporting a 19% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst installed base. Overall, we placed 2,517 Catalysts in the quarter, with 456 at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 8% year-on-year; and 1,119 new and competitive placements in international markets, a 24% year-on-year increase. We also achieved 1,248 premium hematology placements, up 7%; and 713 SediVue placements, down 4% compared to strong prior year levels. Overall, our SediVue global installed base is now over 8,900 instruments, up 35% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenues grew 4% organically in Q4, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets, net of a 1.5% equivalent-day headwind. For the full year, rapid assay revenues grew nearly 8% organically, reflecting continued solid growth of 4Dx Plus specialty and first-generation products. Growth, high customer retention in our rapid assay business continued to benefit from ongoing expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base, supported by additional 10,000 placements in 2019, bringing our global installed base to over 37,000.","Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically in Q4, supported by double-digit gains in VSS and continued solid expansion of digital imaging services.","Overall, global CAG revenues grew nearly 11% organically in 2019, and we're targeting continued double-digit organic gains in the CAG business in 2020.","In terms of our other lines of business. Water revenues grew 10% organically in Q4, including approximately 1% benefit from equivalent days, supported by solid gains across our major regions. For the full year, Water revenues increased 9% organically with faster operating profit growth resulted in 47% full year operating margins. We're very pleased with our continued momentum in the Water business and are targeting continued high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2020.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q4 increased 10% organically. Strong Q4 growth results were supported by benefits from the sales of diagnostic testing programs for airports and African swine fever in China, which offset declines in core swine diagnostic testing as well as solid growth in poultry testing and herd health screening. Q4 results also benefited from favorable year-on-year comparisons related to timing of government and distributor orders. For the full year 2019, our LPD revenue was up 6% organically, with relatively higher operating profit growth benefiting from productivity improvement and cost controls.","We're pleased with our progress in expanding our LPD revenues and profits in 2019 in a very dynamic global climate. In 2020, we're targeting flat-to-modest organic growth in our LPD business as benefits from growth in our pregnancy testing franchise and African swine fever testing programs are moderated by expected ongoing pressures on broader swine diagnostic testing in Asia and bovine government disease control programs in Europe as well as tough compares related to strong 2019 herd health screening levels.","Turning to the P&L. Gross profit was up 10% on a reported basis in Q4 or 11% adjusted for foreign exchange impacts. Gross margins decreased slightly on a constant currency basis, reflecting increased investment in our reference lab business related to day lab capacity, route expansion, system investments and acquisition integration, which offset benefits from moderate net price gains and continued strong consumable revenue growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefited gross profit, were $3.5 million in Q4.","Operating profit in Q4 was flat as reported, including impacts from CEO transition charges. On a comparable constant currency basis, operating income increased 12%, reflecting solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments, supported by high revenue growth. As expected, comparable constant currency operating margin gains were relatively flat in Q4. Operating expense growth increased to 10% on a comparable constant currency basis driven by increases in global CAG commercial capability and R&D. As we'll discuss in our guidance update, investment impacts will carry into the first half of 2020.","For the full year, operating profit increased 13% as reported or 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. This reflects an operating margin of 23% and an increase of 120 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes CEO transition charge impacts. Constant currency operating margin gains reflected a balance 50 basis points of gross margin improvement and 70 basis points of operating expense leverage on strong volume growth.","EPS in Q4 was $1.04 per share, including $0.05 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 17%. For 2019, EPS was $4.89 or 21% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the full year, foreign exchange rate changes decreased EPS by $0.05 per share, net of FX hedge gains of nearly $11 million.","Full year EPS results included $19 million or $0.22 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 3.7% of benefit in our 2019 effective tax rate of 18%. We had interest expense of $30.6 million for the year, net of approximately $2 million of capitalized interest related to major facility projects.","Free cash flow was $304 million for 2019 or 71% of net income. Capital spending came in at $155 million, including $58 million of combined investment or approximately 14% of net income related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and German core lab relocation with some favorability to earlier estimates related to timing of major project cash deployment. We allocated $304 million of capital towards the repurchase of 1.215 million shares for the full year 2019 at an average price of $250 per share. This included repurchases of 532,000 shares in Q4 for $139 million.","Our balance sheet is in an excellent position. We ended the year with $991 million of debt, $90 million in cash and $560 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.4x - 1.45x gross and 1.32x net of cash at year-end. Our strong financial performance and disciplined capital allocation supported achievement of a 46% after-tax return on invested capital, excluding cash and investments for 2019.","We're well positioned to build on the strong performance in 2020, with a financial outlook aligned with our long-term goals. We're increasing our reported revenue guidance range to $2.620 billion to $2.655 billion, up $7.5 million at midpoint, including approximately $5 million of benefit from updated FX assumptions. We're maintaining consistent guidance for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth supported by continued strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance assumes 0.5% growth rate benefit from completed 2019 acquisitions, which is offset by a projected 0.5% FX growth headwind resulting in projected revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%.","We're raising our 2020 EPS outlook to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, an increase of $0.12. This aligns with a comparable EPS growth of 13% to 16%, reflecting a consistent outlook for 50 to 100 basis points of comparable constant currency operating margin improvement. The $0.12 increase in the EPS outlook compared to our preliminary guidance includes approximately $0.05 in combined benefit from the flow-through of 2019 operating performance and favorable updates to assumptions for interest expense and projected reductions in average shares outstanding. We're now projecting approximately $35 million in net interest costs in 2020 and a 1% to 1.5% reduction in average shares outstanding, with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leverage at 1.5x EBITDA.","Our updated outlook also reflects $0.05 in projected tax benefit from share-based compensation activity. We're now projecting an effective tax rate in 2020 of 20% to 21%, including $7.5 million to $9.5 million or 1.5% in tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation in 2020, which equates to $0.09 to $0.11 per share.","Finally, our guidance benefited by $0.02 from updated FX assumptions. Overall, we're now projecting an estimated $0.09 negative year-on-year impact from FX, net of $5 million of projected hedge gains in 2020.","In terms of free cash flow, we're targeting deployment of $140 million to $155 million in capital spending, including approximately $35 million related to the completion of our Westbrook headquarters, German core lab projects and the acquisition of real estate associated with a U.S. core lab. For 2020, this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 75% to 80% of net income including approximately 7% impact from these discrete investments.","In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2020, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, reflected organic gains of 10% to 11.5%, including a projected 1% equivalent-day tailwind related to the leap year. We expect our operating margins will be moderately below prior year levels, reflecting stepped-up commercial and lab investments advanced in the second half of 2019 and as we continue to integrate our Marshfield acquisition and onboard our Westbrook headquarters expansion. We expect operating margin gains in 2020 will be driven by second half performance as we grow into our scaled investments, including our new headquarters and German core lab facility.","That concludes the financial overview. Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2019, with double-digit growth across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water diagnostic businesses. Core CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which now represents over 3\/4 of overall company revenues, grew 12% organically for the full year. Excellent execution across our businesses enabled us to deliver organic revenue of 10%-plus and comparable constant currency EPS growth of 21%, aligned with our long-term financial goals. Return on invested capital at 46% for the year was exceptional. The progress we are advancing on key strategic fronts positions us well to build on this performance in 2020.","Outstanding commercial execution is an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy, and we consistently see a high return in increasing these field-based capabilities that allow our sales professionals to spend more time with customers. Expansion in the number of our global customer-facing resources and investments in enabling commercial systems in areas like Salesforce or service club were two areas of focus in 2019.","We completed the U.S. commercial expansion in Q4 and started the year with our expanded U.S. team in seat and trained. We now have 530 field-based professionals in the U.S. to support market development, more than double the number from five years ago. As we enter 2020, we anticipate some settling in during the first quarter of the expansion as sales professionals, including those newly recruited, develop relationships in their new or reconfigured territories. Notably, we accomplished this expansion in Q4 while delivering 425 new and competitive Catalyst placements in the U.S., a record number. We also continue to make progress with preventive care, with 360 new enrollees in the quarter to reach over 3,800 enrollees in the program to date. Customers are embracing the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution and increasingly view it as a foundational pillar in their own practice strategies. We believe that our North American commercial resources are properly balanced at this point with the addressable market opportunity. And in 2020, we will focus on driving productivity in our expanded sales force, which becomes even more effective over time with tenure and with deeper customer relationships.","Our commercial capability and performance in international markets also continues to advance as they build tenure and competencies with key commercial programs like IDEXX 360. The commercial team's priorities have been driven by the Economic Value Index of an instrument placement that prioritizes high-value competitive chemistry placements, resulting in 24% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements in Q4 to a record of more than 1,100 units.","Our Catalyst installed base outside of North America grew 26% year-over-year, supporting nearly 20% organic revenue growth at IDEXX VetLab consumables internationally in 2019. We expect to gain global leverage and further strengthen execution in 2020 with our enhanced field global commercial organization, as previously announced.","Leading with innovation includes expanding our testing platforms is another key growth pillar. We are excited by the new innovations that we announced at VMX earlier this month. These were enthusiastically greeted by customers as clinically rigorous and value-added since veterinarians embrace new and expanded tools that enable them to raise the standard of care in workflow-efficient ways. This year, we are bringing bile acids to our Catalyst platform with shipments expected this quarter. Catalyst bile acids as a measure of liver function brings reference lab test quality in clinic. This is a great example of how we constantly make our Catalyst platform more valuable to customers. Catalyst has steady innovation heartbeat, with eight clinically important tests launched over the past eight years. The technology-for-life benefit of Catalyst is supporting continued global expansion of this best-in-class testing platform.","Following another great year of instrument placements and customer retention, as of the end of 2019, approximately 41,000 practices of Catalysts installed. Even with the successful installed base expansion, we estimate there remain approximately 70,000 addressable placement opportunities for Catalyst alone around the world.","Our innovation focus increasingly uses large clinical data sets with AI and machine learning to develop highly capable algorithms that assist clinicians with even the most challenging patients. This is the case with SediVue Dx, our groundbreaking platform with Neural Network 5.0, leveraging 350 million images launching this quarter. We are adding advance bacteria-detection capabilities made possible by proprietary reagents, leveraging patent-pending technology at no additional charge for our 8,900 customers. Seeing bacteria is clinically relevant and especially challenging because of their very small size, the difficulty of seeing bacteria in highly cluttered image and because debris could be mistaken for bacteria due to similarity in appearance. Moreover, because our in-clinic analyzers are all connected by smart service, we will be able to quickly update our global installed base with no customer disruption.","In reference lab, our broad and differentiated service portfolio, including fecal antigen Dx continues to support strong same-store customer growth. Because the fecal antigen test does not rely on the visual confirmation of parasites eggs, it's able to uncover twice as many infections as O&P alone, identifying the presence of intestinal parasites earlier in the life cycle of the infection.","We're also further expanding our reference lab offering with an exciting new service, digital cytology, announced at VMX for launch in North America in February. Cytology results often have at least a two day turnaround time. With our new digital cytology service, we are transforming the speed at which customers receive results with expert interpretation to within two hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We're able to do this by leveraging existing capability of an integrated IT workflow, the wide adoption of customer-facing applications like VetConnect PLUS, a field service diagnostic workforce of about 150 field service reps to install and train customers and a global network of more than 100 veterinary clinical pathologists.","We continue to invest in further improving our lab service offering internationally. We're excited about adding our state-of-the-art core German reference laboratory in late spring of this year to our sophisticated global and regional hub-and-spoke laboratory network.","Adoption and utilization of IDEXX SDMA continues to advance nicely in clinic and lab diagnostic modalities. 75% of global Catalyst customers have ordered Catalyst SDMA and have now run at 3.5 million times. In fact, in North America, that number is almost 80% adoption. IDEXX SDMA has also been included in almost 28 million chemistry panels at IDEXX reference labs. Customers are increasingly seeing SDMA, a direct measure of GFR impairment or kidney function, as a standard of care. In fact, the American Animal Hospital Association has updated their canine diagnostics wellness testing guidelines by life stage, and testing guidelines now for the first time include SDMA.","Our veterinary software offerings continue to enjoy robust customer adoption. Customers who use our software applications believe that they are an outstanding enabler to deliver excellent patient care and to running their practices in an efficient manner.","Q4 was another strong quarter for new placements of Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and SmartFlow systems. In North America, we had record patient management software placements, including cloud-based and on-premise software for 63% year-over-year growth at installs for the quarter. We introduced a much improved user experience update with Cornerstone software version 9.1 in March of last year, and we are pleased that well over half of our installed base upgraded by the end of 2019.","Work on Cornerstone cloud continued to progress on schedule in Q4 with very positive customer feedback, positioning us to scale for commercial launch later this year.","IDEXX Web PACS enjoyed another strong quarter with 23% year-over-year increase in subscriptions and a customer installed base of more than 4,500 subscribing practices. We recently released for the end of Q1 delivery a cloud-based software update. It provides new functionality, powered by artificial intelligence, automatically that corrects image orientation and sorts images by body part, potentially shortening read time by 25%. Overall, across these multiple integrated software offerings, we are providing the most comprehensive technology stack offering relied on by independent practices and corporate groups around the world.","In addition to our progress in our core CAG business, we also had strong performance in our Water and Livestock diagnostic businesses in the fourth quarter, with both achieving 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to expand our high-return Water business globally through focus on commercial execution. Our Livestock business has also shown tremendous resilience this year in the face of macro challenges and continued input from the African swine fever in Asia.","Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the long-term potential of our business and our ability to sustain its high growth. One of our key strategic goals is to grow CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which in 2020, we're targeting at 11% to 12%. Major drivers include the strong global momentum and expanding our installed base of premium instruments, continued customer adoption of IDEXX' differentiators like integration and ongoing new platform features and our expanded commercial capability aligned with building on this momentum. Over the next 25 years, we see tremendous opportunity for ongoing growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues with a global addressable Companion Animal Diagnostics market of over $30 billion, with the majority of that existing outside of the United States.","We remain focused on our commitment to providing exceptional service to our customers and improving the standard of care to enable the best clinical decision-making and healthy practice growth.","Before we open the call to questions, I want to thank our employees and congratulate them for the accomplishments in 2019 in pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.","Okay. And with that, we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take the first question from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Brian, maybe just starting off on how we should be thinking about kind of the cadence of organic growth this year. I think you said the first quarter would be 10% to 11.5%. I think that includes 100 basis point benefit from the leap days. So if we back that out, I think the range is consistent with kind of the full year guidance that you gave for organic growth. So should we be expecting sort of a relatively consistent cadence over the balance of the year?","Brian McKeon","We'll obviously provide more detail as we work through the year, but I think that's an accurate read, Nate, is that we've got a full year outlook of 9% to 10.5%. We'll have some benefit from days in Q1. We have, I think, a bit of a headwind in Q2. But net-net, on balance for the year, those should wash out. And I think our 11% to 12% recurring CAG growth is very much in line with the trends that we've been seeing if you adjust our fourth quarter results for the days' impact and just some of the shipment timing effects we noted in Asia, which were modest but can impact the growth rate a bit. We're basically right in the middle of that range and looking to build on that in 2020.","Jonathan Mazelsky","And I would add to that. We're well positioned to sustain that 11% to 12% gain that - we reflect in our going for 2020. You start with the fact that it's a good market backdrop. We saw good clinical visit growth over 2019, 2.5%. We have really nice growth and momentum in our - the expansion of our premium installed base: 16% in total, 19% in Catalysts, 35% in SediVue and those result in consumables growth as customers use those products. We're pleased with the adoption we see around IDEXX innovation. Customers are very enthusiastic about the differentiators we've introduced in past years as well as VMX. And we have an expanded sales force, which is out there partnering with customers, driving awareness and education and ultimately, consideration.","And then we note that - as Brian mentioned in his remarks, we have very high retention across all of our modalities. Customers tell us that they appreciate the differentiators we bring, like integration and the platform extensions they've come to rely on. So we're feeling like we're in a very good position to sustain that growth.","Nathan Rich","Jay, that's helpful. And just a follow-up on your comments on the end market. You kind of noted a strong 2019. Obviously, 4Q is a little bit softer. I know there's kind of always quarter-to-quarter volatility. Is that sort of kind of what you would attribute the 4Q number to? And I think, Brian, you had mentioned December was maybe a little bit stronger. I'd just be curious to know if you've seen that improvement continue into January.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. So the - Q4 was solid, 1.8% clinical growth. Keep in mind, we focus on the clinical growth piece. That's where the veterinarian actually sees the patient and where diagnostics is used as a whole. Now that came off fairly strong Q3, and as noted, a little soft going into the quarter, but picked up in December. So we're positive on the market. We think it's a strong market in 2020 and we don't see anything from a change standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan Daniels","A couple of follow-ups on the new digital cytology. I'm curious, number one, if you can speak to the early feedback you got, particularly at VMX? And then number two, as my follow-up, I'm curious what the revenue will look like from that? I know there's an instrument but also reading at the reference lab. So will that be in the equipment or reference lab lines? Or how should we think about the revenue model?","Jonathan Mazelsky","Right. Thank you, Ryan. Let me give you just some market backdrop and the feedback from VMX. Customers were really very enthusiastic about digital cytology service. Typically, the veterinarian will see patient everyday with lumps and bumps. And they'll take a sample, prepare a slide, look at it under a microscope and then decide whether or not they need to send it out for expert interpretation. That process very often takes a couple of days. But it can - depending upon when they send it in, like kind of Friday, can take 4 or 5 days or so. So they were very, very appreciative and enthusiastic about the ability of being able to send it to us and get a result back with an expert interpretation within two hours and be able to do that all hours of the day, every day of the week and all days of the year.","So the - and the reason we were able to do that, by the way, is because we were able to fit that into our existing infrastructure and investments that we've made, in terms of integrated IT workflow; having a field service organization, which is out there who can help install these systems and onboard and train customers on slide preparation; having clinical pathologists around the world to be able to provide that service.","In terms of market size, and then I'll hand it over to Brian to talk a little bit about revenue. The way we think about this is about 5% of practices are higher-volume users of cytology. So we define that as 5-plus cases per month. About 6,000 of IDEXX practices actually send today out cytology to our reference lab for expert interpretation. That's 6,000 of about a little over 20,000 practices that we do business with in reference labs in some measure. So that gives you just a scope of what we're talking about. We think as they continue to use this, there's potential benefits in using more of it over time and more customers adopting it.","Brian McKeon","Yes. And I think that one way to think about it financially, Ryan, is it is a factor that will be supportive of sustaining the 11% to 12% CAG Dx recurring growth company, including the strong growth that we've seen in U.S. reference labs. It's a valued service and a differentiator and I think something that we believe can support, continue to expand that franchise.","And in terms of instrument revenues, as Jay noted, it's a relatively smaller set of the market that would likely be earlier adopters of the instrument. And we'd anticipate this will be integrated into 360-type program placements, more in the second half of the year as we kind of build market awareness and get the service up and running. But it's not calling it out as a distinct material driver. I think it's something we anticipate will build over time. But we're very excited about it as another example of how IDEXX is adding to the scope of services that we're providing, adding to our differentiation and value and leveraging that to drive the strong double-digit growth in CAG Dx revenues that we should to achieve.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.","Michael Ryskin","I want to follow up on an earlier question just about market conditions, just get a little bit more specific. Maybe you could, I guess, help put my mind at ease. I've had a lot of questions over recent days and weeks about some international markets: the wildfires in Australia towards the end of the year. You've had similar weather in California or heat waves in Europe affect you. Just curious if that had any impact. And also on the recent coronavirus outbreak in China, just a lot of attention there in the market, obviously. And if you could sort of size your China exposure, how much of that is companion versus livestock? And if you've seen anything in terms of vet visits or sort of what you're seeing there in that market and how that factors into your expectations for 2020?","Brian McKeon","Yes. Why don't I start with that, Mike, and hopefully, I can hit on some of your specific questions? I'm sure Jay can expand on that. But in terms of the coronavirus as context, China for IDEXX is a little less than 2.5% of our overall revenues - all of our revenues in China. So it's a - we have a relatively smaller exposure to that market. Over half of that revenue is LPD. So in terms of the more consumer-driven aspect of that business, it's a relatively smaller exposure. We have seen limited impact to-date. We are monitoring it, of course and - but have not factored a specific kind of impact into our outlook at this point. We've got a range for performance. We're comfortable with that. And I think the headline there is relatively smaller for IDEXX and it's relatively early on to kind of be calibrating more impacts.","I think you had a specific question on the Australia wildfires. We did not see a meaningful impact on that in our results. Again, it's something that we're monitoring, but we had very good results in Australia, continued good results.","And I think we've - the European market, we highlighted that we had nearly 20% consumable growth in the fourth quarter, outstanding instrument placements. I think we - the market - and continued solid results in labs. So I think we feel the market backdrop in Europe looks quite healthy.","Michael Ryskin","Yes. A quick follow-up. I appreciate all the color there. You also cited a lot of investment on the gross margin line. You saw that in this quarter and you mentioned some of that's going to continue through 2020 across the reference lab and the rest of the business. Could you help us think through the pacing there, sort of how that progresses over the course of the year? And is that - is this a slight step-up in investment? Is this something that's going to be the run rate go forward? Or is this sort of relatively onetime that should play out over the course of - you'll see the benefits of this over the course of many quarters?","Brian McKeon","Yes. I think if there's any investment in our business, it's truly onetime. I think we're always adding capability. But what we were trying to highlight was that we had, through the second half of 2019, a number of investments that we advanced on the lab front in terms of our expanding our capacity, adding day labs. We had some system investments that we've been making; initial integration of Marshfield, which we'll continue; and obviously, some of the investment we made in the commercial organization in the U.S. And just trying to highlight that, that is going to be on a year-over-year basis, carrying into the first half of 2020. And there are a couple of discrete factors that will be additive to that, and that's basically our Westbrook headquarters, which is coming online in Q1. So we'll have the depletion of that starting to factor into our OpEx growth. And in the second quarter, we will be having the impact of the German core lab coming online.","So the net of that is it's - it wasn't intended to signal incremental investment in the labs other than those discrete areas in the Marshfield acquisition but just trying to highlight that we anticipate our margin gains that we're targeting for next year will be second half-driven, will have some moderate pressure in Q1 and basically, just as we grow into those investments. And we would reinforce our long-term goals of 50 to 100 basis points-plus of constant currency annual margin improvement supported by strong recurring revenue growth, so no changes on that front.","Operator","And next, we will go to the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block","Maybe just a couple, more high-level ones for me. Jay, anything on the competitive landscape that's evolved or maybe that you expect to evolve? Zoetis has had Abaxis for some time now, and they purchased a couple of labs. I know it's early, but - and you got another player that's also making a bigger push in international markets. So curious for your thoughts and any color or details that you see on calling and the potential evolution from a competitive standpoint?","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. Thank you. So the - it's always been a competitive market, and it's clearly still a competitive market, and we continue to perform very well, as we've highlighted this morning. Our focus is really on growing and adding value for our customers. A lot of our volume growth, as Brian highlighted, comes from same-store sales, comes from existing customers, creating awareness and adoption of relevant testing.","So from a strategy standpoint, it's really continuing to be able to work with those customers, introduce the innovations, take our commercial capability, expanding commercial capability, partner and help those practices succeed. So that's really the focus. The - a lot of competitive intensity, but that really hasn't changed. And we continue to do well and we continue to experience moderate price increases on the 2% to 3%, net basis. So we're feeling good.","Jonathan Block","Okay, great. And there's a few surprises I thought about on the P&L, so I'll stick high level. Jay, your thoughts on - and willingness to work with other players in the industry to help drive diagnostics growth? And what I mean by that is, that's what you want to do. You're working with Trupanion in some shape, way or form on pet insurance. But there was chatter at VMX that you're going to partner with QE with their sort of their prescriptions platform. And so as leading the company, I'd love to get your thoughts on how you see these opportunities evolving for the company over the next couple of years and IDEXX' willingness to take a more aggressive role there.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. So we've had ongoing partnerships with the specialty diet that - in pharma and software companies in the marketplace. The way we tend to think - I'll address the software piece and the integration piece specifically. The way we tend to think about that is we take an open systems approach. So a group of customers, once it reaches a certain size of critical mass come to us and say that they would like us to integrate an application into our PIMS systems, then we do it. We want to be able to give the customers the workflow that they desire. But in terms of overall partnering at VMX, we participated in a park study, which showed the efficacy - the superior efficacy of fecal antigen. So always looking for ways in appropriate sort of partnership structures of developing the market for diagnostics.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Erin Wright","I had a similar question, just given some of the bundling tactics of your competitors. I was curious if you could better leverage your unique positioning in this market as sort of an agnostic player but also partner with large pharma manufacturers to do your own creative bundling with therapeutics or other product offerings? I guess, have you contemplated those sort of partnerships or collaborations more so recently than you have in the past? I'm just curious how that's evolving.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. So when we talk to customers, what customers tell us, is that they - when they're looking at diagnostics and they're looking at solutions to adopt, they believe that it's highly differentiated. It's a highly differentiated category in their practices. It's a decision that they make through the lens of how to deliver best care. It tends to be separate from how they think about therapeutics or specialty diets. They are making typically long-term decisions because of systems that they're buying that need to be integrated that they may have in their practice 5, 10 years. So from a buying standpoint and partnering decision, the customer really separates those two. So the - that hasn't changed with the recent acquisition of some of our competitors.","Erin Wright","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then where do you stand now in terms of market share on your PIMS systems? Where are we at across the industry in terms of converting to cloud-based systems? And can you speak to your positioning around the competitive front there as we head into some sort of potential wave of system upgrades as well?","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. So we did - we've done very well this year in terms of payment placements. Cornerstone, we've been able to upgrade more than half of our installed base of Cornerstone with a completely new user interface. We've been able to do this because we have a field-based organization, field service reps who go out and partner with customers. We also - our Neo system, which is really more geared towards general practice customers and mobile customers, is native cloud-based. That's received just, I think, very enthusiastic reception, and we've been able to grow that nicely.","But the key is it's not so much in the PIMS system per se. It's in the connectivity that we're able to provide between software and our diagnostics and the applications that work together. So what customers tell us is they appreciate our PIMS systems. But what they really like is they like the fact that it all works better together, so the PIMS and the applications and VetConnect Plus and the diagnostics. And that ability to support their workflow clinically and from a business standpoint and capturing charges and work that they do is what sets us apart and continues to really provide strong differentiation.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.","Andrew Cooper","With the integration going as expected, was there anything that sort of surprised you? And I guess, from a from a customer reaction perspective, I think sometimes we view some of the regional players as - sometimes view it as an alternative to the larger options that are out there in the market. So has there been any pushback from customers?","And then from a margin perspective, the gross margin, I think, in 4Q was maybe a little lighter than we had expected. So what's the opportunity kind of on Marshfield? And in general, how much maybe did mix impact in the quarter? But on Marshfield specifically, to capture synergies and get kind of that incremental revenue up to - similar to your consolidated lab margins or kind of how you view that in terms of the extra capacity that you added with the acquisition? So any color there would be great, and I appreciate the feedback.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Great. Yes. So the Marshfield integration is on track. We're excited by Marshfield. It really - we've welcomed over 2,000 customers from Marshfield, and they now have access to IDEXX' differentiated tests like SDMA and fecal antigen and VetConnect Plus. And the initial reception has been enthusiastic from those customers. We - keep in mind that a good number of those customers were IDEXX customers already. They use one of our modalities. They may have used our software systems. So it's not like they didn't know us. This just gives us a chance to work more closely with them and to provide reference lab services. I'll turn it to Brian if Brian would like to make a remark on margin and what we see there.","Brian McKeon","Yes. As expected, we - as we're working to integrate Marshfield, there are some impacts from that. And that we did highlight that as one of the factors, and that will continue into the first half. We're - we have work going on, on that front. But look, over time, I think we're - we've demonstrated and we're confident that the addition of customers into our national lab network and supporting them through our over 50 labs now in the U.S., which is how we think about this business as a national business, is something that we would anticipate in getting leverage from and is supporting the longer-term goals that we have for margin improvement from our reference lab network. So it was a near-term factor and will be a near-term factor to a degree, and we'll get leverage on that over time. It will support our margin improvement going forward.","Operator","And we'll take one final question.","Brian McKeon","Yes, this will be our last question. Thank you.","Operator","That will be from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities.","David Westenberg","So some of the feedback from veterinarians on the cytology instrument starts the conversation in oncology. So I apologize, I'm going to kind of ask an industry kind of wide question here. But does this - how do you see the oncology market kind of playing out in the next, say, 3 to 5 years? Is there opportunities here in diagnostics, in the reference labs? Is there opportunities in therapeutics kind of the way we have in the human market with, say, cancer profiling or early detection of cancer? Just if you can give me kind of a broad overview of that and maybe just cytology kind of start that conversation.","Jonathan Mazelsky","Yes. So the oncology service is something that exists in the marketplace today. It's centered more around specialty practices and there's lots of different areas in oncology, just like there are on the human side in terms of both drugs and therapeutics and LINAC systems and chemotherapy. So that's a very broad question with lots of different areas.","From a diagnostic standpoint, that's something we're always taking a look at. There's - around genomics and proteomics and being able to detect cancer earlier. Certainly, digital cytology, in many instances, you're looking for cancer. So it does begin that discussion when a patient comes in with mumps and bumps and wants to know whether or not their pet is okay.","Okay. And so with that, thank you. With that, we'll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q4, for the full year of 2019 and for the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world.","Operator","Thank you.

I am pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2018. We had excellent results in Q4 which concluded another year of outstanding financial performance for IDEXX. We achieved 12% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter supported by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and 15% growth in premium instrument placements. Overall reported revenue increased 14%, aided by favorable year-on-year changes in FX rates. ","Our strong finish to 2017 supported achievement of full year organic revenue growth of 10.4% consistent with our long-term financial goals. Results were driven by accelerated 13% organic gains and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting strong double-digit growth in U.S. and international markets. Our full year EPS was $2.94 net of a non-recurring $0.34 per share charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted for this factor, full year EPS was $3.28, $0.02 per share above the high end of our guidance range. This performance reflected strong top line growth and achievement of full year operating margins of 21%, a 140 basis point improvement year-on-year on a constant currency basis. EPS grew 21% on a comparable constant currency basis in 2017 above our long-term financial goal range for the second consecutive year.","We're well positioned to build on these results in 2018 reflected in our updated outlook for 9.5% to 11.5% organic revenue growth which now includes an estimated $10 million year-on-year benefit from revenue accounting standard changes. We're also maintaining a consistent outlook for 75 to 125 basis points improvement in constant currency operating margins while investing 10 million in incremental operating expense leveraging benefits from U.S. tax reform. Overall strong operating trends, favorable FX rate changes, revenue upside from accounting changes, and significant projected benefits from U.S. tax reform support a $65 million increase to our 2018 preliminary revenue guidance to $2,205 million to $2,245 million and a $0.55 per share increase to the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $4.04 to $4.18 per share. ","We'll provide an update on our 2018 guidance later in the call. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results beginning with an overview of performance by segment and region. Q4 performance was led by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were 434 million up 12% organically supported by 13% organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues and in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging businesses. For the full year, CAG revenues increased 11% organically to 1.7 billion driven by accelerated 13% organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues.","Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue of 37 million increased 8% organically in Q4 ahead of our expectations. Results reflected higher than projected year-end government program and distributor ordering and solid gains in recurring revenues supported by growth of our pregnancy platform. These gains were moderated by continued pressure on dairy and swine markets in China which have constrained emerging market gains. For the full year, our LPD revenues were 128 million reflecting relatively flat organic growth. For 2018, we're planning for flat to modest organic growth in LPD [ph] overall consistent with recent underlying growth trends. ","Our water business revenues grew 16% organically in the fourth quarter to 29 million aided by favorable comparisons to prior year channel inventory adjustments in advance of our go-direct initiative in Brazil. Adjusted for these changes, we estimate Q4 water organic revenue growth was about 9%. For the full year, water business revenues increased to 114 million, up 10% organically including about 3 percentage points of growth benefit from go-direct initiatives. We're very pleased with our momentum in the water business and believe we're on track for continued high-single digit organic revenue gains in this highly profitable business in 2018.","By region, U.S. revenues were 298 million in the quarter, up 11% organically. Gains were driven by strong 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, despite a 1% headwind from fewer equivalent days. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables and high-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range with the bulk of our growth driven by volume.","IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from about 5,200 clinics. In Q4, patient visits increased 2.0% and clinic revenues increased 6.1% compared to the prior-year period. For the full year U.S. revenues reached 1,204 million up 10% organically driven primarily by our U.S. CAG business, which represents nearly 94% of total U.S. revenues. We achieved U.S. CAG organic growth of 10% in 2017, supported by accelerated 12% organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains.","International revenues in Q4 were 208 million up 13% organically. International results were driven by 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued strong consumable gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base. International revenues reached 766 million for the full year or 39% of total IDEXX revenues supported by organic gains of 11%. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14% organically for the full year, reflecting double-digit growth across Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin American regions. Overall, international revenue gains were moderated by flat organic growth in our international LPD business.","In terms of segment performance, our Q4 results were supported by accelerating expansion of our premium instrument base and continued strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities. Globally, we placed a record 3,650 premium analyzers in Q4, up 15% compared to prior year levels driven by a 25% year-on-year increase in Catalyst placements and record SediVue results. Q4 results included 1,863 Catalyst placements. This performance reflected 1,300 placements in international markets of 34% year-on-year and 433 placements to new and competitive counts in North America, a 25% increase over strong prior year levels. Consistent with our strategic focus, 77% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts in the quarter.","In the quarter, we also placed 1,040 premium hematology instruments globally, 747 SediVues and 1,630 SNAP Pros bringing year-to-date SediVue placements to 2,267 and year-to-date SNAP Pro placements to nearly 6000. Instrument revenues in Q4 were 37 million, up 2% organically as very strong placement gains offset deferred revenue impacts under 2017 GAAP accounting standards. Our EVI metric in the U.S. was up significantly in the quarter reflecting very strong gains in competitive Catalysts and SediVue placements consistent with our strategy.","For the full year IDEXX made substantial progress in growing our global premium install base. We now have 29,855 Catalysts installed globally, the growth of 22% year-on-year. These gains reflect 37% year-on-year installed base growth in international markets and 10% gains in North America driven by 1,369 placements in new and competitive accounts, a 14% year-on-year increase in North America. International Catalyst placements reached 3,839 this year up 19% and on track with our long-term expansion goals.","Growth in our instrument customer base supported by sustained high retention levels and augmented by continued seller utilization gains to grow continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumer revenues of 134 million grew 14% organically in Q4 supported by robust gains across U.S. and international markets. Our SediVue installed base continues to expand and contributed 2% to consumable growth in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenue of 162 million also grew 12% organically in the fourth quarter net of the 1% equivalent day headwind. Continued high Reference Lab gains were supported by strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the U.S. reflecting double-digit organic volume gains with existing customers augmented by solid price realization and net customer additions. International Reference Lab gains were solid in the quarter with organic growth at high single-digit rates driven by consistent gains in Europe.","Rapid assay revenues continued to trend very well. Q4 revenues of 46 million grew 10% organically benefiting by about 1% net due to favorable international distributor inventory changes offset by fewer equivalent days. Rapid assay gains continued to reflect solid volume growth in 4Dx and specialty test and continued progress we're gaining share in first generation products in the U.S. Veterinary Software Services and Diagnostic Imaging System revenues were 37 million in the quarter up 13% organically driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our cornerstone installed base and very strong growth in digital radiography placements which were up 24% year-on-year in the quarter. ","Turning to the P&L gross profit was 272 million in Q4 or 53.8% of revenues up 13% on a reported basis. Adjusting for foreign exchange impacts gross margins decreased 30 basis points. Continued solid net price and productivity gains were offset by stepped up investments in lab capacity in operations, approximately 1 million of IT related costs reclassifications from operating expense to cost of goods sold, relatively higher year-on-year LPD and water costs, and relatively lower average instrument margins reflecting strong international growth. Certainly these impacts were specific to the quarter and we're targeting continued solid gross margin expansion 2018. Foreign exchange hedge impacts reported gross profit reflected a $1 million loss in Q4 related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar limiting year-on-year net FX gains to about $0.02 per share in the quarter. ","Operating profit in Q4 was 98 million up 17% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains in operating expense leverage supporting a 40 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 11% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis driven by investments in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology. For the full year operating profit was 413 million, this reflects an operating margin of 21% or an increase of 140 basis points on a constant currency basis in 2017. This outstanding full year result reflects about 100 basis points of constant currency gross margin gains and 40 basis points of benefits from operating expense leverage benefiting from our accelerated revenue growth.","EPS in Q4 was $0.43 per share including a 31 million or $0.34 per share non-recurring charge related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform, $0.06 per share in benefit from a share based compensation accounting adoption, and less than $0.01 in discrete tax benefit from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. The $31 million tax reform related charges are current estimates and relates to the deemed repatriation of the company's foreign profits net of deferred tax remeasurement at lower corporate tax rates and other related adjustments. The charge came in below earlier estimates reflecting favorable clarification of specific factors related to deemed repatriation tax impacts for IDEXX.","For 2017 EPS was $2.94. Adjusted to exclude the onetime tax reform impact EPS was $3.28 per share. For the full year foreign exchange rate changes increased revenue growth by 0.3% and reduced EPS by $0.01 per share including FX hedge loss impacts of about $4 million. For the full year adoption of a share based compensation accounting guidance provided 28 million or $0.30 per share and benefit. Discrete tax benefits also contributed $0.04 per share benefit in 2017. Adjusting for these factors 2017 EPS growth was 21% on a comparable constant currency basis.","Free cash flow was 299 million for 2017, this represents free cash flow at 114% of net income or 102% adjusting for the U.S. tax reform charge that includes deemed repatriation taxes required to be paid over eight years. This performance was delivered while supporting 76 million in annual capital investment. Our strong cash flows and continued positive business momentum supported the allocation of 270 million in capital towards share repurchases for the full year including repurchases of 350,000 shares in Q4 for $55 million. This brought our 2017 repurchase levels to nearly 1.75 million shares at an average price of $155 per share. ","Of note over the last five years we deployed just under $2 billion to repurchase 28 million shares or more than 25% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period for an average price of $70 per share significantly enhancing per share returns for IDEXX shareholders. ","Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, we ended the year with 1,266 million in debt outstanding including 606 million in fixed rate term debt and 655 million outstanding under our $850 million revolving credit facility. At year-end we had 472 million in cash and investment balances of which 99% was held internationally. Our leverage ratios at year-end is a multiple of EBITDA where 2.4 times gross and 1.5 times net of cash investment balances.","Turning towards 2018 outlook our growth momentum and disciplined operating performance positions as well to deliver continued strong financial results in 2018 aided by substantial projected benefits from U.S. tax reform. As noted we're raising our 2018 organic revenue growth outlook to 9.5% to 11.5% gains incorporating an estimated $10 million or 0.5% growth benefit from revenue recognition accounting changes. Our outlook is supported by expectations for continued high levels of premium instrument placements and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues including about 1% of growth benefit to CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in 2018 for retroactive revenue accounting standards change impacts.","Overall we are raising our reported revenue outlook by 65 million at midpoint to 2,205 million to 2,245 million or reported growth of 12% to 14%. This increase reflects strong operating trends including the flow through of higher than expected 2017 performance. The projected 10 million accounting change benefit and about 35 million of additional benefit from updated rate assumptions for foreign exchange which are reflected in our press release. At the new FX rates we project that our reported revenue growth will be increased by 2% to 2.5% in 2018 related to year-on-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. We're raising our 2018 EPS outlook to $4.04 to $4.18, an increase of $0.55 per share reflecting about $0.06 in upside from strong operating trends, $0.10 of additional EPS related to our updated FX estimates, and an estimated $0.39 per share in net benefits related to U.S. tax reform. ","The EPS outlook reflects consistent goals for year-on-year constant currency operating margin improvement of 75 to 125 basis points. We have maintained this outlook while incorporating 10 million of additional operating expense investment and about 5 million of incremental capital investment in 2018 leveraging benefits from U.S. tax reform. This outlook results in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 28% to 33% including an estimated 13% of net EPS growth benefit related to U.S. tax reform.","Our outlook for our effective tax rate in 2018 is now 20% to 21% including an estimated 11 million or 147 million, excuse me, including 11 million to 14 million or about 3% in projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock based compensation. This outlook reflects projected recurring tax rate benefits to the newest -- the new U.S. corporate tax structure primarily driven by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21% net of certain offsets. Our updated outlook for share count in 2018 is for reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5% which assumes that we maintain net leverage at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA.","Under U.S. tax reform we will have increased flexibility related to global management of cash and debt balances. Our 2018 projections reflect an assumed optimization of our global net interest costs utilizing excess cash balances over time resulting in an outlook for net interest expense of 35 million to 36 million. Free cash flow was projected at 80% to 85% of net income for 2018 including approximately 15% of free cash flow impact driven by 50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation and expansion as well as about $5 million of incremental growth capital investment supported by additional cash flows associated with the U.S. tax reform. Incorporating these estimates our 2018 free cash flow outlook reflects projected capital spending of approximately 140 million.","Foreign exchange rates will be a positive factor impacting 2018 profit results at the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release. At these rates we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will increase reported EPS by approximately $0.12 per share net of $7 million in currently projected hedge losses. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2018 we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 13% to 14.5% range reflecting organic gains of 9.5% to 10.5% net of a 1% equivalent to a headwind. Reported Q1 revenue results will benefit by approximately 3.5% to 4% from favorable year-on-year FX impacts at the rates assumed in our press release. ","Q1 operating margins are expected to be flat to modestly higher than prior year levels reflecting near-term moderating impacts from Reference Lab growth capacity investments and relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we lap incremental commercial investment advance in the second half of 2017. We expect our effective tax rate in Q1 to be 15.5% to 16.5% including projected benefits from share based compensation, exercise activity which is typically higher in the first quarter. That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2018. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Thank you, Brian. We had a very strong finish to the year across our businesses and around the globe. I'm very pleased with our team's success in 2017 in growing the market for IDEXX's innovative diagnostics and software solutions including for the companion animal market resulting in over 10% organic revenue growth and EPS gains at the high end of our long-term financial goals. Our North American commercial team saw accelerated successes at high value instrument placements, a key driver to the profitable recurring revenues of instrument consumables while at the same time growing both our Reference Lab Diagnostic modality, the largest contributor to North American recurring revenue and our Rapid assay line. ","As investors recall we undertook a 12% expansion in our U.S. field organization fully in place in Q3 but still early in the learning curve. In Q4 we saw this expansion kick into gear. We also resumed the double-digit productivity in our EVI growth in instrument placements per rep that we achieved in the first half of the year and the combination of the expansion in the number of reps and the productivity per rep in North America grow our 25% growth in Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts and 23% growth in SediVue placements. Along with these results we saw sustained high levels of customer retention which are world class levels. Our 98% retention of in-house chemistry accounts in U.S. compares favorably to any period since we announced our intention to go fully direct in 2014. ","Our U.S. Reference Lab revenue growth in the fourth quarter sustained mid teen range even with a 1% headwind related to equivalent days. North American growth continues to benefit from strong same store sales growth as customers appreciate and adopt our unique offerings including fecal antigen, SDMA, molecular diagnostics, and we saw increasing customer retention levels reaching 97% from the Reference Lab modality. These results are driven by our deep sales coverage and strengthening customer relationships that come over time combined with an expanding diagnostic offering that is unique as well as new tools and technologies that help customers adopt and grow preventive care testing protocols. This volume led growth in our Reference Labs helps us assure our long-term margin expansion growth goals in the lab operation. ","Our Companion Animal Group international operations completed a year with exceptional performance in placements of instruments led by Catalyst, our instrument platform with the strongest generation of recurring consumable revenues. Premium instrument placements growth of 24% to almost 25% in the high value Catalyst placements growth was 34% resulting in full year Catalyst placements of 3,839 and a 37% expansion in our international Catalyst installed base. Results were strong in virtually every country of every geography Europe, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Our move to a direct sales structure in most countries in each of these regions over time has proven to be highly successful and our teams around the world are applying their entrepreneurial spirit to bringing Catalyst and the rest of the IDEXX lab offering to countries in a way that inspires veterinarians to adopt this advanced technology in accordance with local market needs. ","I was also very pleased with the waters continued growth and profitability and the rebound in the growth of livestock, poultry, and dairy or LPD from Q3 levels. No water benefit this year from go-direct initiatives that set the stage for sustained long-term growth in this business. While LPD leveraged the benefits of new innovations like our pregnancy testing platform to offset broader market headwinds constraining overall growth gains in 2017. These are exceptional businesses represented by IDEXX professionals around the world that are committed to our purpose. ","The key innovation accomplishment for Q4 was the on-time launch of Catalyst SDMA. In adding this remarkable assay to our in-house Catalyst solution we are greatly expanding access to SDMA and the availability of estimate providing expanded pet care. As Brian mentioned we have close to 30,000 Catalysts instruments in customers around the world and these Catalyst customers have been anxiously awaiting for the availability of this slide as evidenced by the over 3,500 unique practices in North America that have already bought the test since our pre-launch and 60 days ago and are beginning shipping just a couple weeks ago. Many of our Catalyst customers do not have access to our Reference Labs for a variety of reasons and others are committed to running their chemistry real-time in the practice. We call this real-time care or the practice of running the panel immediately on the in-house lab during the exam and providing care at that moment in time.","We're also looking to build a clinical appreciation of SDMA with veterinary schools which is facilitated by Catalysts SDMA since these institutions typically run lab work on their premise and now can do so with Catalyst. We find that the more customers gain experience with SDMA in a clinical setting where it can make the difference in the health of their patients, the faster they realize how essential this new parameter is in routine chemistry testing including a sick animal, disease monitoring, and preventive care protocols. Catalyst SDMA would celebrate this learning and market adoption and once customers conclude that SDMA is critically important then they become highly loyal to IDEXX for their diagnostic needs. ","Our SediVue results were also amazing in Q4 bringing 2017 total placements to well over our 2000 of 2,267 units. This month we're rolling out our next generation algorithmic software to the entire customer base called Neural Network 3.0. This version has the benefit of images from a million patients and uses machine learning to add quantification to red and white blood cells, advance to detection of certain bacteria as you can imagine bacteria is an essential urine parameter, and also bring other enhancements to the image algorithm. The instruments growing capabilities that come from having over 3,800 systems in the field it's achievable through our 10 years of experience with smart service or the Internet things which means that the unique IDEXX innovation for in-house lab equipment. Every pet sample run on SediVue improves SediVue for all future patients and this is the impact of smart service and machine learning.","We also remain on track for the launch of SNAP Fecal Dx in the summer of 2018, our biggest SNAP launch in 15 years. SNAP Fecal will launch our ever growing installed base of SNAP Pro customers and our success with fecal antigen at the Reference Labs. As a result of the great success in SNAP Pro placements in 2017 we have an installed base of over 17,000 instruments in almost 10,000 practices in the U.S. alone with continued momentum in 2018. The volume of SNAP 4Dx in the U.S. market that comes from SNAP Pro customers easily exceeds 50% of our U.S. 4Dx volume up significantly from where we were when we went direct in early 2015. ","SNAP Pro penetration combined with strong field presence, a powerful online marketing channel and demonstrated clinical accuracy of our SNAP technology sets the stage for continued solid expansion in our Rapid assay franchise. The strength of our business performance reflects the attractiveness of our recurring revenue business model around the world which achieved accelerated 13% organic growth in CAG recurring revenues in 2017. We have consistently focused on aggressively allocating capital to grow our businesses organically. The attractiveness of investing in growth in our franchise will be further enhanced by U.S. tax reform. ","Simply put tax reform is huge for IDEXX as it is for our U.S. customers who are generally small businesses. And anything that helps our customers become more successful economically also helps IDEXX and tax reform gives our customers greater resources to invest in IDEXX's advance innovations be they diagnostic, digital radiography where we had a breakout in Q4, software or staff education. All these areas support practiced growth and the acceleration of their partnership with and utilization of IDEXX through the benefit of the owners and their pets. As a result of tax reform we are accelerating our investment in software, data, and related innovation. We are the innovative leader in veterinary software with nearly 39,000 VetConnect PLUS accounts, 22,000 of which we call active monthly users, 9,000 customers for our practice management solutions and over 5,000 customers for our cloud based apps that add value to the customers practice management software. ","Our data capabilities have already generated groundbreaking insights in medicine using a data driven evidence based approach. And in 2018 we aim to use data to help our customers appreciate how to grow their protocols with the appropriate use of diagnostics to better meet the needs of today's pet owner. Importantly we will be able to show how any particular IDEXX customer benchmarks in relation to their peers and colleagues and other practice locations in diagnostic utilization. We're also using some of the benefits of U.S. tax reform to expand the company's financial math we provide the U.S. -- two U.S. employees who save for retirement using IDEXX 401K plan. This expansion to a dollar for dollar match of 5% of salary or up to 5% of salary will help our U.S. employees better provide for their retirement in a highly tax efficient fashion. Retirement planning is a societal challenge and we are further supporting our employees with this expanded benefit. ","Tax reform supports investments towards our purpose and our long-term growth strategy. The return on investments that we've made in past years in the U.S. market starting with our sales force reconfiguration and then decision to go fully direct and then estimates we continue to make as we grow the topline will increase on an after tax basis. Prior to 2018 our pretax dollar of U.S. return generated $0.65 after federal tax and in 2018 this same dollar generated $0.79 after federal tax, a growth of 21% all other things being equal. This gives us confidence to continue to grow our investments in this incredibly attractive market. We are able to do that and still meet the company wide margin expansion goals that Brian reinforced earlier in the call driven in part by 2018 operational efficiencies resulting from our accomplishments in 2017 and prior years. All of us remained dedicated to our purpose, to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and shareholders by enhancing the health and well being of pets, people, and livestock. So with that we will open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Nick Hiller","Good morning, this Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could give a bit of an update on the SNAP Fecal Dx launch specifically when would produce of that product begin, and how much interest is there in that products specifically outside of the core IDEXX customer base especially given how prevalent fecal tests are and how unique the offering will be? And just a follow-up on assays, any thoughts on the potential competitive launch of a Rapid assay to compete against 4Dx? Thanks. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","We're very excited about the SNAP Fecal launch which we expect in the summer of 2018. I think as you referenced fecal testing is a routine preventative care protocol for dogs, usually done with the annual or semiannual exam. The vast majority of those are run in-house today using manual methods in the microscope and so we see this as an opportunity to replace that in-house manual method with using biotechnology and ELISA method. So, our rough estimate is around 40 million fecal tests are run in North America annually. And a large majority of that is run in house although we're also very successful in driving fecal testing in the Reference Lab with our fecal antigen offering. And so, like anything the penetration and adoption of any product takes time, but we think this is going to be a long-term grower. I\u2019ll just noted I was really excited about the rapid pick up with SDMA on slide with over 25% of catalyst customers buying in the first couple months. We think it is an amazing start up, but I think Fecal will be a major -- the in house fecal leveraging the Reference Lab fecal antigen technology will be a major franchise for us. ","We remain excited about strong franchise we have with vector borne disease screening. We believe the announcement to which you refer validates that customers really need multiplexing a comprehensive disease screening, which has been our strategy from the beginning and what we've been doing in that business is turning it into a razorblade business model by adding a SNAP Pro which not only interprets the result but automatically runs a result, connects it to our ecosystem, captures the charge, and adds it to the medical record. And at this point, easily over 50% of our U.S. volume is running on SNAP Pro and that will continue to grow as we continue to replace SNAP Pro we placed over almost 6000 of them last year. We also have a really unique accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity that has been validated by third party technology and I think that is unique to our SNAP ELISA platform. And so I think we remain excited. This is a business though that is still under penetrated and not enough customers are running 4Dx or vector-borne disease screening as part of preventative care protocols on their dogs. And so while we had very strong high single-digit growth in 2017 and we've launched -- regionally launched actually vector-borne disease screening over 15 years ago, we see continued growth in this market in 2018 and beyond and that's a growth that we expect to continue to drive.","Operator","Thank you, we will go to the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","Hey thanks, it is actually Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Congrats on the quarter guys. Want to touch on a couple quick points, the instrument growth in the quarter, it's nice to see they have returned to positive growth but just want to confirm the difference between the instrument revenue growth and the placements, is that along the lines that we saw in previous quarters of the revenue recognition that we talked about in 3Q or is there something going on with pricing there? And then also I have a follow-up on the margins, saw that you reiterated that targets for 2018 of the constant currency op margin growth, but still saw some choppiness in gross margins this quarter, can you talk about some of the gives and takes there and what your expectations are on the gross margin line for 2018?","Brian P. McKeon","Sure, why don\u2019t I take those on instruments, that's correct. We did have some deferred revenue impacts, very, very strong growth as noted, and under current accounting we had deferrals which under the new accounting will be a new set of rules and we won't have that same dynamic. Moving forward, they will be different pieces moving forward, but net-net I think that's more reflective of the current GAAP standards and we work through that. ","Michael Ryskin","And that's starting in 1Q? ","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, we'll break that out for you. It's going to be complicated, it will be very, very detailed disclosures because you have a restatement -- modified restatement of prior year balance sheet information and then obviously the new accounting, try to highlight that net we now estimate that overall that's going to be a plus 10 million impact for IDEXX. It will from a growth rate point of view which is actually going to help us on the recurring CAG and we highlighted that was about a point of growth rate impact and that's more related to the restatement of balance sheet the prior year aspect, and on the instruments well basically new accounting gets you to more upfront revenue recognition, but there again will be some restatement impact that will be a slight headwind, so we will clarify that all for you. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","I think just to get back to your -- the fundamental essence of your question, these remain the pricing, it's not a factor. These are economically very successful placements and are really no different than prior quarters in that regard, and so I think the unit placement numbers particularly in the U.S. to new and competitive accounts and of course internationally we're placing to both new competitive and upgrading a VetTest which is a good -- which also contributes to recurring revenue growth. These are very high quality placements. ","Brian P. McKeon","And also of note, the EVI metric we noted was up significantly, that's a measure of value and we'll be rolling that out to international markets in 2018 to reinforce that. On your question of gross margins, a couple of themes here, our Reference Lab business in the U.S. is growing very quickly and with accelerating growth momentum and we made decisions to add routes basically, add capacity to support the growth that we see coming, make sure that we are fully staffed, we're doing a better job on retention of our lab employees. And the net of that is it is extremely healthy business. We actually delivered close to 100 basis points of constant currency margin improvements in our lab businesses here while supporting those investments, so in the near-term, that has some moderating impacts on gross margins but we will quickly grow into that.","Michael Ryskin","And then also knew this quarter was -- the fourth quarter was the reclassification of million\u2026? ","Brian P. McKeon","Yeah included in that too was our laboratory information management systems. We're recording those costs that previously the amortization was recorded in the OPEX and we're moving that to cost of goods sold. So no net profit impact but it has a moderating impact from margins. We also had another factor that was more specific to the quarter in our LPD and water businesses. We were comparing to a prior year Q4 number that had favorability related to basically inventory dynamics, accelerated production growth and higher levels of absorption. That's not something we anticipate carrying forward so the outlook that we have for operating margin growth next year we reinforce the 75 to 125 basis point improvement that will be driven by gross margin gains. So we feel good about that and I'd also note that that covers the 10 million of incremental investment that Jon highlighted so the underlying growth is really about 50 bips stronger than that. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","And that 75 to 125 basis point margin improvement is off of the higher revenue which as Brian referenced was FX related, was accounting related, and was flow through of the revenue over delivery so higher growth. But none of those things are changing our 75 to 125 basis point incremental margin on that higher level. So there are some fundamental goodness there. ","Michael Ryskin","Got it, that's all really helpful, thanks guys. ","Operator","We will go to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Erin Wright","Hey, thanks. I notice there is a nice uplift in Rapid assay, I guess let's all try the amount [ph], I guess how much of it was price and it continues to be a competitive market there, do you think that growth rate is sustainable or what is your overall growth assumption assume for that segment thanks? ","Brian P. McKeon","Thank you, yeah, of course it is a global business. We had a good Rapid assay performance around the world. It is predominantly North American. We had good performance in North America that was more volume than it was price. I think our reps are pretty engaged in Rapid assay business it is combine with their -- the value that they are bringing with SNAP Pro, a placement so when they're placing SNAP Pro they are really talking about the entire Rapid assay family. Our 2018 guidance for recurring revenue growth incorporates the benefit of the second half year launch of SNAP Fecal. And so I think you know I think our overall Rapid assay growth if you will combined scope of what I would call reasonable assumptions for the Rapid assay business augmented by new revenues from a new product launch. Of course that will take time to be adopted so we're only talking about a partial launch and like everything we just like the ramp to be faster than it will be. But that will be new revenue from new innovation. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","And it was price -- volume driven growth. ","Brian P. McKeon","Volume driven growth in the fourth quarter and in 20\u2026 ","Jonathan W. Ayers","We always have a timing of -- year-over-year timing of programs that are underlying 2% to 3% recurring CAG price gains is pretty consistent across\u2026 ","Brian P. McKeon","Yes, we just -- we had just good performance in Rapid assay. We saw market share gains, continued market share gains in the first generation in 2017 and the vector-borne disease franchise just continues to grow in volume. And even though we're 15 or 16 years into that it just shows the long runways of growth that we have. In fact that was the best volume growth we've had in that franchise in a number of years. But every year it's grown so it's still amazing that we don't have as many dogs as we have that get annual screening for vector-borne diseases.","Erin Wright","Great and I'm curious on your thoughts on just the overall market as we stand here kind of, I felt that you saw strong 6% growth in practice revenues across your data set, I guess what does your guidance imply for 2018 in terms of the underlying demand trends across the CAG segment and where does it stand now, I guess how much room do we have to run, I know we've seen this massive improvements since the recession over in terms of overall veterinary demand trends but I guess what are some of the key metrics that you're tracking and looking at that give you kind of confidence in underlying demand, thanks? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well we have as Brian reported the 6% growth in veterinary practices which really comes out of it. That's a measured number out of what 5000 or 6000 of practices that we saw in Q4 and really consistent with the growth over the course of the year. And that's overall practice revenue at our customer level. Our assumptions for 2018 are consistent with really what we saw in 2017. But the runway every time we look at this, the runway for growth is amazing because what's interesting is our customers are growing faster than the market. We can measure this okay, our customers are growing faster, they're growing their overall practice revenues faster, they're growing their diagnostic portion of their revenues faster. They are growing it faster because our reps are helping them adopt more and more diagnostics to meet the changing needs of today's pet owner. What's interesting is the best practices in doing this are 2-3 X times the size of the average practice and just in our portfolio practices who are themselves above the market averages. And so we see the opportunity to help customers appreciate that while they may be doing well they can actually be doing better because other practices that are very much like them are doing better. And so the diversity of practice -- of performances inspires us to inspire the practices, to continue to focus on advancing diagnostic utilization and protocols using IDEXX's expanded and unique menu of tools to bring value to pet health. And to do so meeting the needs of the pet owners that want this when they appreciate the value and of course some -- the best practices are doing a great job doing that. So we need to bring those best practices to the broad market and that's why we have very deep sales coverage with strong account relationships so we can grow not just adoption of IDEXX but adoption of diagnostics as part of the care equation.","Operator","And we go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel Nicolaus, please go ahead. ","Jonathan Block","Great, thanks, and good morning. Maybe two questions, first one what still needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint for SNAP Fecal antigen, is that sort of a gating factor between I don't know a June launch versus September? And part two sorry, that same first question is maybe you can just talk to us some of the moving parts of call it the low end of the organic guidance versus the high end, the 9.5 versus the 11.5 as you look at the year. Is it based on traction with new projects or limiting Rapid assay in roads from competitor, the overall market, would love to just get your thoughts and then I got a follow-up? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Very quickly on the first question a point of care test, that tests for infectious diseases is one of the few areas that requires a regulatory approval. So for instance our lab test, fecal antigen test does not require regulatory approval but the same technology on a stamp does and so that does -- that is a factor that will that we need to be successful with, the U.S.D.A. approval in order to launch the product. We're confident of the track record there that always adds a little bit of uncertainty as to exactly which month or when","Brian P. McKeon","Yeah, and just in terms of revenue outlook the key driver of that of course is going to be the recurring CAG growth number Jon so that's the 12% to 14% if you adjust for the accounting change, its 11% to 13%. We finished this year just under 13%. I think it's a reasonable range. We're obviously growing very quickly. In terms of high growth rate we need to execute very well and we think that's a reasonable range at this time in the year. It's not projecting risks, it's more just reflecting that we're growing off a base at high rates and need to execute well and need to execute well against the new innovation launches and that's principally why we have that type of range this time of the year. ","Jonathan Block","Okay, got it. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","One of the nice things is we over deliver in the fourth quarter on revenue so with the same growth rate that the absolute revenues in 2018 are -- they're growing off higher base. So, as Brian said we need to continue to do a great job executing and supporting our customers with great products, reliable products, and great sales coverage around the world. ","Jonathan Block","Got it and just the second question, you deemed across most of the CAG were occurring modalities but maybe the only one that I could sort of nitpick on was international lab. I think you mentioned up high single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, the U.S. has been up mid teens. It just seems like a relatively big delta and I think that's for the second or third quarter we've seen that delta. Arguably international should sort of be in that sweet spot of SDMA. And I know the competitive landscape is more fragmented O.U.S. So Jon any reason why that international rough lab is call it lagging some of the other diagnostic modalities that we see with the mid teen growth from some of your other areas? Thanks guys. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yeah, I think that's a fair observation from my relative basis. Of course I wouldn't sneeze at high single-digit organic revenue growth in any business in the current market. But relative to the success of our other businesses a fair characterization. The fact of the matter is our international organizations are really prioritizing the highly profitable placements of Catalysts where we just have a unique instrument you know you saw those Catalysts placements up 37% year-over-year and then the retention on these Catalysts is like 100% and 99.95% or something. It's an amazing business, it's a -- these are profitable placements and then we also have a reference lab business. By the way the Reference Lab business is not as profitable as other lab business internationally whereas in the U.S. we've got a really good network effect taking place. We want to make sure that we have that network in fact in place and that when we grow the Reference Lab business and let's recognize a reference lab business internationally there is a lot of different labs in a lot of different regions. Our German lab for example is doing very well, it's very profitable business which is why we're investing in a world class lab. As part of the relocation of the core German lab. Other parts of the world are not as profitable as they need to be and so we're focused more on profitability there before growth with the -- again the primary sales growth being the placement of the analyzer. These analyzers that we're placing today are going to be there decades from now. I mean it's just it's just a great business.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead. ","Nicholas Jansen","Hey guys and congrats on a great quarter. Just following up on that point Jon, just looking at the Greenfield opportunities O.U.S. versus U.S. as you think about Catalyst. Certainly the U.S. opportunity is probably starting to diminish a bit. I mean where are we on the O.U.S. trajectory as a number of that test still outstanding that could be upgraded, areas where you're seeing competitive displacements, just maybe walk us through how we think about the sustainability of this global like Catalyst placement growth that we've seen over the last three years? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yeah, I just do want to note the 25% year-over-year growth and Catalyst placements to new and competitive counts in North America I don't want to gloss over that a number. Our U.S. teams had an extraordinary quarter and we think there's a lot of runway ahead in the U.S. because of the result of the fabulous product line now supported by SDMA and great commercial teams but turning to the essence of your question on the international opportunity, it's wide open. And as you know we've shared the number of customers who we believe are targets for Catalyst placements internationally. Over 75,000 customers and that\u2019s a growing number of course. And so we're upgrading that test but roughly half of those placements are to new and competitive accounts. So they're organic accounts, we're replacing really an aged install base of competitive analyzers that have really fallen behind and then of course once we put Catalyst in there it stays there which I've mentioned with a very, very high retention rates. We have markets like China where it's basically a Greenfield opportunity and then we have markets like Europe that's both a vet test and a very attractive Greenfield and new account and competitive account. We as Brian mentioned in a previous question we are moving -- international was now moving to the compensation approach which looks at the economic value index of an instrument placement. What this is going to do is put even more focus on new and competitive. ","Well it turns out our vet test customers internationally are pretty loyal customers. I mean they're in the high 90's in terms of their loyalty and so it's not like we have to rush to upgrade them because they're already pretty loyal. Of course we will continue to do so but the highest value placement is to a newer competitive account and as we move to EVI we expect to see a jump in the productivity of the same sales efforts towards the highest value placement. So even with the phenomenal success we had in 2017 we would expect to see a productivity jump in 2018 in placements and yet we have very, very -- less than -- a little bit less than 4000 placements of Catalyst internationally and you put that in the context of the opportunity. We have a long runway of opportunity for filling out the world with a very attractive point of care technology to help veterinarians provide care for pets. And they're all going to have SDMA. And so we're running, we are rolling out SDMA internationally in the next couple of months on Catalyst and so that -- and the international markets have developed the market appreciation for SDMA. So they're just as excited as our North American teams were with the availability of SDMA now being able to be run on Catalyst. ","Brian P. McKeon","I will just reinforce the strap we talked about, the build to our five year growth and trying to achieve over the next five years 20,000 placements in international markets and we're right on track with that. So this year was right in that range and we're building each year the percentages coming out of new and competitive placements. So we're feeling very good about the execution on the international front. ","Nicholas Jansen","That's very helpful and as we think about the recurring revenue associated with those O.U.S. Catalysts placements where we are on the utilization map on those relative to the U.S. and if you can maybe compare that to maybe three or five years ago are we seeing more and more utilization off of these boxes as these end markets become more like the U.S. or are we still very early in that transition? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","So it's a great question, the bottom line is we're still very early, okay but we are seeing a same store sales growth and we're seeing it because they're adding menu. We saw it with P4 when we had P4 to a Catalyst install base. We're going to see it with SDMA and interesting parameter we don't talk that much about CRP. We've launched CRP now globally. There are markets outside the U.S. that already value CRP. We don't have to explain to them why that's an inflammatory market and they're adopting it that gross utilization. So, as we add menu to the analyzer we see growth in utilization of the installed base. Where we really haven't even begun the story outside of North America it's preventive care. And so that's kind of the next wave, it's not a 2018 wave, it's couple of years out as we grow the market, as we grow our intensity of sales coverage we can then really take the preventative care story around the world. But right now they're just working on sick animal testing and so it's just amazing how early we are in the whole story and yet we are we're getting utilization growth primarily from sick animal testing from this menu expansion which customers appreciate is helpful in helping rule in and rule out disease on a sick presentation.","Operator","And we go to the line, I am sorry go ahead. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","We have time for one more question, I know we're up against the hour.","Operator","Absolutely, the last question will come from the line of Alex Nowak with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Alexander Nowak","Great, good morning everyone. I just had a two part question. Jon you mentioned this in your prepared comments but regarding tax reform to your customers is it fair to say that most of that customers will see some sort of tax rate because I believe the personal service corporations are going from a flat 35% rate to 21%? And then the second part of that is have you talked with any customers since the beginning of the year and have they signaled what they plan to do with the extra income such as reinvest into analyzers, is that place filled out or they just simply plan to park the extra cash? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay, very quickly we expect most to answer your question it's a little complicated because there's a couple of different moving parts but the bottom line is yes, our customers will see benefit. They're all small businesses, they are [indiscernible]. They will see a benefit to tax reform. I think they're just beginning to realize. I am seeing around the corner on this okay, I don't think our customers fully appreciate because they didn't take tax accounting in veterinary school. Okay, they ask their accountants and their accountants are still trying to figure it all out. So here we are February 1st, I would say it's still early days. So what I'm saying is as this starts to -- as they start to see the benefits I think their appreciation for the attractiveness of their business gives them some room to make incremental investments and of course we're going to be there inspiring them with IDEXX technology.","Alexander Nowak","Okay, that's helpful. And then you are only couple weeks into the SDMA launching Catalyst but are you seeing any cannibalization of SDMA in the reference web? ","Jonathan W. Ayers","No, we -- absolutely not. This is all a testing begets testing. We in fact think the estimated option in our in house will actually grow the Reference Lab business because of the appreciation. We have seen this issue in launch after launch where we have something in Reference Lab and then we launch it in-house. It actually helps our Reference Lab. You can go back 15 years when we launched a five part white blood cell differential with absolute ridiculous sides with laser sight or by studying you are going to see Campbell's any reference lab and you've seen what's really happened to our reference lab over that period of time. So we actually think this augments Reference Lab growth over time because it accelerates the clinical appreciation of SDMA in the care of pets. ","Alexander Nowak","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","And I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Ayers for closing remarks. ","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, thank you very much. We had the little bit longer comments because of the end of the year and because the number of exciting things going on at IDEXX. So I appreciate we didn't get into all the questions and we'll try to do so afterwards. And we appreciate all the attention. I just really want to thank the IDEXX organization for fabulous 2017 and the excitement and momentum that we have I think will be evidenced at the BMX previously known as the North American veterinary conference show that's taking place this weekend. I know some of our investors will be there. Our sales teams will be there. We're very excited about the prospects for 2018 and I think that's reflected in our comments and in our financial guidance for 2018. This is a long-term enduring growth business. As we enhanced the health and wellbeing of pets, people, and livestock we see the long-term growth vectors ahead of us. So with that we will close the call and thank you very much for signing in.","Operator","Thank you and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Merilee Raines. Please go ahead.","Merilee Raines","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. As you've seen from our press release, our first quarter revenues of $332.1 million grew on a reported basis and organically by 3%, and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.81 grew 12%. There are a couple of discrete items in earnings noted in our press release. First, the benefit of the reinstatement in early January of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 is recognized in full in the first quarter and contributes $0.05 to earnings per share. This benefit was anticipated and reflected in our 2013 guidance at the time of our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","The second item relates to the recording of a loss reserve of $4.1 million or a $0.05 reduction to earnings per share due to a misappropriation of funds leading to a bankruptcy filing by Trendset, a vendor providing audits and payment services for our North American freight invoices. We became aware of this issue all relating to payment activity in the first quarter in late March. Earnings per share, as adjusted for this item, were $0.85.","First quarter organic growth was a couple of points below our thinking in January. At that time, we called for mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter due to difficult year-to-year comparisons for both our Companion Animal offerings due to the unseasonably mild weather in the first quarter last year and result in high patient visits, and our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business due to episodic testing related to a milk contamination outbreak in China. The lower-than-anticipated growth comes primarily from revenues associated with our placements of capital equipment and to a lesser extent, our reference lab services. And I will provide further details momentarily.","Overall, our assessment is that our core diagnostic offerings for in-clinic and send-out testing are healthy, and our steady rollout of innovations in diagnostics and information technology drive differentiation that supports our forecast for accelerating growth.","Despite lower-than-anticipated revenues, earnings per share, exclusive of the Trendset loss provision, were $0.01 to $0.02 better than our expectation in January. This is largely due to favorability in our gross margin from product mix, price realization and efficiencies in both our product manufacturing and lab operations. Currency had an immaterial impact on earnings per share versus our expectations.","Let me provide a word or 2 on the Companion Animal veterinary market and our international performance. There have been several surveys of the U.S. veterinary market indicating low year-to-year growth in patient visits and practice revenues in the first quarter. Our own cornerstone data with a sample set of approximately 600 customers is consistent with these reports. Patient visits were essentially flat as compared to 3% growth in the fourth quarter of last year and practice revenues grew just under 4% as compared to 5% in the fourth quarter. Recall as well that we estimated Hurricane Sandy muted fourth quarter patient visit growth by about 0.5 point. While low growth was anticipated, given the tough comparison created by the mild weather in the first quarter last year, growth decelerated over the course of the quarter. This may be in part a reflection of the harsh weather experienced across much of the country in February and March this year.","In addition, less optimistic views on economic recovery as reflected in recent reports for March may also have been a factor.","In Europe overall, our Companion Animal businesses grew organically by just over 6.5%, very strong performance given the still turbulent economic and fiscal environment. As anticipated, we saw a strong growth in the Nordics given our change in commercial strategy to serve our customers directly. In addition, we've been making good headway in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, and France posted low double-digit growth. The strong growth in these areas was supported by single -- by solid mid-single-digit growth in our core markets in Germany, the U.K. and Italy.","Organic growth in Asia Pacific across our entire portfolio was roughly flat versus the first quarter of last year performance in large part due to transitory items such as the timing of some distributor orders, changes in the structure of marketing programs from the 2012 to the 20 -- from 2012 to 2013 for the canine parasitic disease testing season and the enhanced testing last year in China related to an episode of milk contamination. We expect mid-teen organic growth for Asia Pacific for the balance of the year.","And now for some revenue highlights for our businesses. VetLab instrument and consumable revenue of $103.7 million grew 3% organically. Instrument revenue at $15.8 million declined to 22% organically year-to-year. Similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, our newly offered volume commitment reagent rental programs negatively impacted our instrument revenue growth by roughly 10 points and total IDEXX growth by just over 0.5 point for the first quarter.","Our worldwide chemistry placements declined 9% year-over-year, primarily as a result of fewer VetTest placements outside of North America, most notably in Asia where we largely sell through distributors and so are more subject to timing issues between quarters. To a lesser extent, we saw a similar occurrence in Europe, where we had very strong placements in the fourth quarter, and first quarter commercial activities focused on some rebuilding of the order pipeline. In fact, lower placements of VetTest in Asia and Europe accounted for more than 70% of the chemistry placement decline year-to-year. Placements in North America were slightly favorable to our expectations. We continue to be pleased with the quality of our placements. We saw 45% of our North American placements and more than 40% of our worldwide placements for Catalyst go to customers new to IDEXX. Further, as in the fourth quarter, we saw our reagent rental program resonating with larger, higher consumable usage clinics. For the full year 2013, we maintain our projection for chemistry placement growth to be low single digit similar to our growth in 2012.","Our worldwide hematology placements also declined 9% in the first quarter. This was off from our expectation of mid-single-digit growth for the quarter, largely due to lower placements in North America. We believe that the structure of marketing programs contributed to less focus on placing hematology with chemistry analyzers in the first quarter, and this is something we can address going forward. Similar to Catalyst, we are seeing that the percentage of ProCyte placements to customers new to IDEXX continues to grow, reaching nearly 50% in the first quarter. We expect the momentum for our full hematology portfolio to build throughout the year, aided by the full commercial launch of LaserCyte Dx in January of this year and strong growth internationally. This expectation, combined with our first quarter performance, translates to our updated projection for hematology placement growth for the year in the mid-single digits as compared to low-teen guidance in January.","Instrument consumables revenue of $75.5 million grew organically 9%, or 10% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. While this result is consistent with our full year 2012 growth, we estimate that first quarter growth was negatively impacted by about 1 point by a month's [ph] acceleration of purchases in 2012 in anticipation of our price increase at the beginning of 2013.","We are maintaining our expectation for full year normalized organic growth of 11% to 13% for instrument consumables, driven fundamentally by unit volume growth that has consistently been in the low double digits for the last several quarters. In 2013, we expect this unit volume growth will be further augmented by enhanced price realization. The drivers for price, as noted in our January call, include changes in our sales channels, both with a higher selling price to MWI and from the move from distribution to a direct sales model in Scandinavia, as well as a lower unfavorable price impact from consumable utilization-based marketing rebate programs that have reached more of a steady state.","Our first quarter rapid assay sales of $44.1 million grew organically 2%. When we further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels and the estimated impact of changes in seasonal marketing programs year-to-year, first quarter growth is approximately 5%. This growth is in line with our full year expectation of 4% to 6% for the rapid assay business for 2013. U.S. distributor inventory levels for instrument consumables and rapid assays averaged 4 weeks at the end of the first quarter based on forward-looking demand, a very consistent and healthy metric.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services business with revenues of $107.6 million grew organically 6% in the first quarter. We estimate that our growth was negatively impacted by about 2% due to 2 factors: first, the leap day in 2012; and second, the difficult weather comparison year-to-year for North America as mentioned up front. When we adjust for these factors, the business grew at 8%, consistent with the fourth quarter. While we expected Q1 to be the lowest-growth quarter for 2013, the performance we achieved for the quarter was about 1 point below our expectations at the time of our January call. This is primarily the result of somewhat lower growth in our bioresearch business and open sales positions in North America in the fourth quarter of last year, yielding lower new accounts exiting the year with their attendant business in the first quarter. We are fully staffed now and geared up for increased coverage and effectiveness.","For 2013, we now expect our reference lab and consulting services organic revenue growth to be 8% to 9%, a modest adjustment to the high end of our range of 8% to 10% provided in January, reflecting first quarter performance, and we expect that we will see growth in the remaining quarters of the year accelerate with contributions from both volume and price.","Our core strategies of expanding coverage, leveraging our specialty test menu and providing enhanced information and connectivity through VetConnect PLUS will continue to provide opportunities to gain -- to both gain new customers enhance -- and enhance the loyalty and testing volume of our existing customer base.","Our Practice Management and Digital Imaging Systems business with revenues of $21.5 million grew 2% organically in the first quarter. Performance was below our expectation for both product lines. The healthy order book entering the first quarter gave us the strong start in January, but order rates dropped off in the latter half of the quarter. New sales resources were added in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, and the learning curve for these businesses is 6 to 9 months given their relative complexity. Accordingly, we expect to see increased productivity in ensuing quarters. We continue to remain confident about the strong differentiation of our offerings. Pet Health Network Pro, our complete suite of client communication services, together with our Cornerstone Practice Management System, were very positively received during the American Animal Hospital Association's annual event in Phoenix in March.","As a reminder, these offerings received the association's endorsement in the fourth quarter last year as the first fully integrated client and practice management system. Pet Health Network Pro continues to show rapid acceptance in the marketplace with orders up by more than 30% sequentially and the subscriber base growing by roughly 2\/3 from year end to the end of March.","In our digital line, in the first quarter, we launched the I-Vision DR, the next generation of our flat-panel direct radiography system. We also provided a software release, which deepens the integration advantages between IDEXX digital and practice information management systems. With our continued focus in the second quarter on strengthening the commercial execution of these modalities, we now project low double-digit organic growth for this business in 2013, down from mid-teens forecasted in January.","Our newly combined Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business generated revenues of $28 million, a 3% decline in organic growth year-to-year. Though this performance was a bit better than our expectation in January, we believe that the favorability was largely due to timing between quarters. Accordingly, we continue to expect revenues for the combined Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business to decline organically in the low- to mid-single digits for the full year. Over the remainder of 2013, we anticipate further declines in European government testing programs for livestock that will be partially offset by higher growth from new products as they continue their adoption ramp. Though still in the early days, we are pleased to see that the market and operational synergies we anticipated from combining the management of our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy businesses are playing out.","In line with our thinking, our Water business grew 6% organically to $20.7 million in the first quarter, reflecting contributions from our core Colilert testing business, particularly in the Americas and Europe. And we reaffirm full year organic growth expectations for this line in the mid-single-digit range.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin at 55% was roughly 100 basis points above our expectations. As mentioned, this was due to favorable revenue mix with lower margin instruments comprising a smaller share of first quarter revenues than anticipated. Also price realization and efficiencies in product manufacturing and lab operations helped us achieve the gross margin favorability.","Operating expenses were in line with our expectations in January, excluding the Trendset loss reserve, which was recorded in G&A expense.","Our effective tax rate of 26.2% was a bit favorable to our expectations, largely the result of the Trendset reserve, which was recorded in the U.S., a relatively high tax rate jurisdiction. As mentioned up front, the first quarter tax rate reflects the full effect of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit approved earlier this year, while the 2013 benefit is recognized ratably over the year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $228 million of cash and $262 million of debt for a net debt position of $34 million. Our inventory balance of $148 million was $7 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter. This was due primarily to the timing of purchases of hematology instruments.","We project inventory levels will come down 2% to 3% from the first quarter level, particularly in the second half of the year. DSO was consistent with our experience at 41 days.","Our free cash flow was $6 million or 14% of net income, which was in line with our expectation. As noted in the past, free cash flow tends to be lowest in the first quarter due to the payout of annual performance-based compensations and increases in receivables related to the ramp of some of our more seasonal product lines. Additionally, first quarter free cash flow was a bit lower than our experience historically, due to spending on our new administrative facility on our main campus that will be completed in the third quarter of this year.","Looking forward, we project full year revenues of $1.38 billion to $1.39 billion, which yields organic growth of 7.5% to 8%. This organic growth is down from our previous guidance in January of 8% to 9%, reflecting primarily our latest thinking on revenue associated with capital placements. Further, we expect that sequentially accelerating organic revenue growth over the course of 2013 will result in second half growth roughly double the growth rate in the first half of the year.","The acceleration will be driven by increasing contributions from recent investments and innovations such as Pet Health Network Pro, VetConnect PLUS and our core lab in Germany, as well as easing year-over-year comparisons for several of our businesses and enhanced commercial effectiveness in our North American Companion Animal Group.","Changes in currency rates, since our January guidance, have also created about a 1% headwind to growth and so reported growth is now projected to be 7% to 7.5%, as compared to 8.5% to 9.5% previously. We expect full year gross margin to be about 54.5% or 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance, reflecting our latest thinking about revenue mix for 2013, as well as our first quarter performance which, as noted, was favorable to our expectations. Also, we expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be roughly 50 basis points higher than for the full year average, the result of the first quarter performance and the seasonality of our vector-borne disease testing business.","We expect the operating expenses to be approximately 35% of revenue for the year, an increase of about 100 basis points compared to our previous thinking, primarily the result of our lower revenue outlook. While we will manage discretionary spend and drive for operational efficiency, we will also continue to make investments in innovation, our commercial organizations and international infrastructure that we feel are appropriate to drive top line growth. We expect the operating margin to be about 19.5%, which would represent a 10- to 15-basis-point expansion year-to-year when normalized for currency and discrete items consisting of the pharma milestone payment in 2012, and the Trendset reserve in 2013.","We expect the tax rate to be 29.5% to 30% for the year, which is about 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance. In addition to the Trendset loss reserve impact on our effective rate, we are projecting a slight increase in the benefit from the R&D tax credit related to 2013 activities. Net interest expense is expected to be $2.5 million to $3 million, and weighted average share count is expected to be down 2.5% to 3% from full year 2012 levels.","All of this leads to updated 2013 earnings per share guidance of $3.40 to $3.46 for the full year, both on a reported basis and when normalized for the offsetting discrete items recorded in the first quarter associated with the 2012 R&D tax credit and the Trendset reserve. This compares to guidance in January of $3.42 to $3.52 when also normalized to exclude the 2012 R&D tax credit benefit.","Unfavorable movements in currency lower both ends of the range by $0.04. Additionally, we are tightening our range by $0.04 to reflect our latest thinking about business performance. The reconciliation of the change in our earnings per share guidance from January to today is detailed in our earnings press release. Earnings per share growth for 2013 is projected to be 10% to 12% when normalized for currency and the discrete items in both years as enumerated.","And so now as I hand it over to Jon for the 45th and final time, I just want to say how grateful I am to have had the opportunity to work with such an exceptional team of colleagues over the last 28 years and to express my confidence in their collective ability to continue to bring significant value to our markets and to our shareholders going forward.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Thank you, Merilee. Thank you for that and another fine job in describing the quarter. There's a lot of detail there, and we're going to go through some of it in the Q&A. Certainly, we are pleased with our profit performance x items. It was better than our expectations by $0.01 to $0.02. And we really remain fundamentally very enthusiastic about the strategic outlook for the company. Let me make some comments in that regard.","The diagnostic portion of the Companion Animal Group and we've referred to this historically as VetLab instrument and consumables, the rapid assay and reference labs lines of business is the single largest, single line at IDEXX. You put them all together, what we call the CAG diagnostics, and it contributes about 75% of the company's revenue. Our product offering provides real and unique medical and economic value to our customers. And within this group, we are doing well internationally, with particularly good growth in Europe despite the economy in that region. Instrument consumable growth globally, which is the most important part of the instrument modality, is right on track with 10% underlying revenue growth in the quarter and a solid forecast to accelerate to 11% to 13% for the full year. This growth is in large part as a result of the quality of our instrument placements and the strong loyalty of our customer base. While the instrument revenues are pulling our growth down for the quarter for various reasons, the objective behind the lower margin instrument revenues is being achieved. That is placements that drive consumable growth. Rapid assay's growth is tracking right ahead of expectations. Reference lab offering is a point or so in growth below our expectations. However, we believe that the market opportunity for lab services is quite significant and our global service offering is both broad and highly differentiated.","This quarter, we are introducing a significant innovation with our commercial activities in the North American Companion Animal Group diagnostics, a regional segment that contributes 50% of the company's total revenue in -- contributed in 2012. That is, we are transforming the structure of our field sales organization. We're very excited about this change and what it'll do to support the growth in the veterinary practice and thus accelerate our Companion Animal Group diagnostic revenue growth. But first, let me provide some strategic background before I describe the change because the change is very in line with the strategy. As investors know, we are transforming diagnostics in the veterinary practice with the introduction of VetConnect PLUS, our integrated cloud-based platform for presentation and analysis of a patient's in-house and reference lab diagnostic information. VetConnect PLUS adds significant value to the diagnostic information provided by our products and services, including the ability to have instant mobile access to new results including those from in-house instrumentation, trend a patient's result over time for far greater medical insight and generate pet owner-friendly reports that can easily be shared, both in paper and electronically. We have now reached 6,700 practice activations in the U.S., up from 4,500 3 months ago and utilization of the system to view, analyze and share diagnostic results grows by the day.","Looking at diagnostic results within VetConnect PLUS versus the old way of a single point in time on paper is like moving from snapshots to YouTube or from film to digital radiography. Once a customer experienced the multiple benefits of VetConnect PLUS, they don't want to go back to paper-based results to view, analyze and share. What VetConnect PLUS demonstrates is -- the value we provide to customers is that of highly relevant medical information. This information provides medical insight to the doctors and a vehicle to convey this insight and indeed, the value of diagnostics and medical care to the pet owner, who, as investors know, is the payor in our business. Interestingly, almost the entire menu of diagnostic results that is generated by our in-house equipment can and is also generated by our reference labs, that being chemistry and hematology. And the majority of testing run in reference labs is also that same chemistry and hematology that can be and is run with our in-house lab. In addition, almost all customers use some combination of in-house and reference lab service to produce this routine baseline diagnostic information for their patients. When historical diagnostic data can be combined and trended across the 2 modalities, medical insights are greatly magnified. What is really interesting is if you look at IDEXX customers for our in-house instruments and our reference labs in North America, far more customers use one or the other offering from IDEXX than use IDEXX for both testing modalities. In fact, of those that use either, only a little more than 1\/3 use us for both.","While it is counterintuitive that we have so little customer overlap between these 2 modalities, perhaps we should not be all that surprised when we recognize that we have used specialized sales roles for each for our entire history. And yet the cross-selling opportunity is obviously significant, even more so when we recognize they generate common, in large part common, information on the patient that feeds VetConnect PLUS. Strategy dictates structure and as I mentioned, this quarter, we have launched a significant innovation in the structure of the North American diagnostic field sales organization, again, accounting for 50% of our total revenues. In this new sales model, we move to one IDEXX sales consultant, who is a single point of contact with customers for all IDEXX diagnostics. This sales professional will be able to best represent what we call the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage, the highly differentiated value of our comprehensive in-house and reference lab diagnostic offering and our complementary access tool, VetConnect PLUS. As you can imagine, this is a very significant change that has required that we create a new set of territory maps for the entire North American geography, as we merge the 2 role types into 1, a veterinary diagnostic consultant. We have been in the planning stages of this transformation for almost a year. We announced the new approach to our sales organization in February and have now completed the design, announced the territories and implemented the new sales structure in about 20% of North America starting at the beginning of April, this month. The remaining 80% of the reps in North America will make the conversion to their new roles and their new territories in July. I'm delighted to report that the response by our sales organization and customers so far has been very enthusiastic. It just makes sense, this new approach is customer- and sales-force-centric and it's a logical outgrowth of our innovations in providing highly relevant medical information across multiple med alleys through VetConnect PLUS. We expect that the change will allow us to be far more effective in promoting and supporting our full IDEXX diagnostic line and the key elements that are unique to the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage.","In the new full diagnostic line sales structure, each sales professional has a much smaller geography to cover, and the total number of accounts that can be covered is -- are those that can be covered in a 4-week call cycle, which are -- allows our teams to develop a deep relationship with our customers, far different from our prior, more transactional approach to sales with separate specialized roles for in-house and reference testing. It will also greatly reduce nonproductive travel time that comes from covering much larger geographic territories and increases the frequency of customer calls. The goal of our new veterinary diagnostic consultants is to grow their accounts usage of IDEXX-generated diagnostic information, either by cross-selling the modalities of IDEXX diagnostics customers are not yet using, adding entirely new customers who are inspired by our IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage and supporting existing accounts that are already full IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage partners because they already use our in-house equipment rapid assays and our reference lab diagnostics. By helping them grow the diagnostic services of their hospital in accordance with the practice of best medicine and thus, their purchase volumes of IDEXX diagnostics. With smaller territories and a regular call cycle, the number of field sales calls per rep will increase, we think, 60% for any given period. Obviously, that's a very big increase. A second benefit is that we expect lower field turnover as a result of more manageable territory sizes, more productive customer relationships and clear sales -- field sales objectives and career paths. Lower turnover leads to greater tenure, deeper relationships and greater product knowledge. All this leads to higher customer satisfaction and IDEXX sales productivity. A third benefit comes from the opportunity presented by the territory remapping. With our knowledge of the customer base and the opportunity, we are able to rebalance our coverage to more closely align the opportunity in every territory. Think of this as a kind of redistricting, if you will. So big benefits, regular call cycle, increased tenure and rebalancing. Even if a fraction of these changes leads to sales productivity, we could see a significant boost to revenue growth from our strong product and service portfolio.","On top of this, as part of this realignment, we are growing our field sales headcount for diagnostics in North America by 13% in the second half of the year. In other words, more feet on the street. These additions augment the growth that comes from per rep productivity. Of course, we recognize that any change of this magnitude requires intense focus to manage transition risk. We are training our sales organization to represent all diagnostic modalities: reference labs, in-house equipment and our rapid assay test kits. While our diagnostic sales professionals have partial knowledge that came from their specialized roles, the new full line role requires more comprehensive knowledge, if they didn't already have prior experience than actuality of many reps who do have requisite knowledge. Early indication from the first wave of transition that has already taken place are the field reps -- field professionals feel well supported in this training, and indeed, many of them have already been informally supporting the sales of the full line as a result of our strategy of bundling products and services.","Even though all the professionals will have changes to their territory, including some who will require relocation, the enthusiasm is so high that we expect the risk of turnover associated with the change to be very low, less than 5%, and entirely due to relocations that come from the remapping. We will backfill with experienced sales professionals quickly. The enthusiastic response by our sales organization is matched by the initial response to customers and sales calls from reps in the new role. Customers resonate with the message that they will have one IDEXX rep to support their practice with all their diagnostic needs from IDEXX. We're also getting good reaction from our distributors who see IDEXX now as a stronger partner in supporting the customer and growing IDEXX diagnostic usage. Along with the change in the field sales organization, we have also implemented a change in our CAG diagnostic marketing group. Our marketing focus is to grow the usage of all IDEXX diagnostics regardless of modality. This group has been assembled from some of our best marketers that previously resided within each diagnostic line of business.","Before I open up to Q&A, I just want to turn briefly to a couple of comments on Europe, which had great performance in the quarter. In Germany, this is our first fourth quarter with our new core lab in Leipzig and we are pleased with the market acceptance of our service. Though early days and small numbers, we achieved twice our anticipated incremental revenue, attributable to new lab and the courier network in Q1. The lab is now servicing customers in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Belgium. We'll continue to put logistics in place to expand services throughout Europe, providing further opportunity for growth across the region. Second, our go-to-market change in Nordic countries, where we replaced our distributor with the direct sales organization in January, has gone better than planned. In this set of countries, our Companion Animal Group sales are up more than 35% year-over-year in the quarter, which is a great start, obviously. This is the benefit of a year of advanced planning in setting up the go-direct strategy. In summary, we have a great product line that is leading to transformation with our customers. We are now aligning our commercial organization in North America and have already good commercial performance internationally. This will lead to a sustained organic revenue growth in years to come, as we execute the strategy. So with this, I'm happy to open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The first question, let me focus on some of the changes you're making in the field sales force. It appears that, that's something that could be a big long term positive. But in the near term, are you actually pulling some of your reps out of service for a while to do the training on the areas that they were not representing before? And if so, is that kind of accounted for in your growth outlook going forward?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Oh, yes, but it's very -- it's a week of intensive training and for example, we accomplished it in the first week of April for our reps. It's really nothing out of the norm and it is fully accounted for in our numbers.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And as we think of your organic growth guidance, how much of that is driven at this point by increased quotas or expectations that the sales force will drive a ramp in the second half versus some of the other innovations you've made and some of your other product launch objectives? Just trying to get a feel for how dependent you are on this working for your growth.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Again, Brian -- Ryan, that's a great question. It really isn't -- there isn't any increased quotas. We have -- we're assuming a continued productivity of the sales force. But the upside and, of course, it'll take time to determine exactly when that upside is going to happen and a lot of that upside will be adding -- having customers add other diagnostic modalities from what they already use at IDEXX, given that, it's interesting, majority of our customers actually don't use all of our diagnostic modalities. They only use some of them. So the answer to your question is, we don't have any upside associated with this change in the forecast. And clearly, that's a possibility. It's hard to predict when that will happen. We are confident it will happen, and it'll be a sustained long term but it will start happening in Q3 or Q4, or will that really drive 2014 growth. None of that's in our guidance for the year.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then one quick follow-up and I'll hop off. Just as you think about the realignment in the field sales force, is it really moving more towards a consulting-type role where you're working less to just push your product sales versus showing the value of integration and how to drive overall practice revenues, and how that can manifest by using more of your diagnostics?","Jonathan W. Ayers","That is exactly what is happening and one of the benefits. What's interesting is instead of coming with a point of view, which the specialized reps came with, we're coming with, what is the customer's need and how do they want to grow their practice and what do they want to achieve and what role does -- do the in-house modalities of instruments, consumables and our rapid assay kits and what role does the reference lab play in helping them grow that. Now, obviously, we believe there are some best practices out there like Real-Time Care, but there are other best practices like using the broad menu that's available both on the in-house and even more particularly in the reference lab to gain deeper insight and then there are best practices associated looking at all the diagnostic history on a patient over time. This organization allows us to have those far deeper conversations and including things like integration than previously, in part because the reps are going to be able to establish a deeper relationship. They're going to be calling on these customers, on average, once every 4, 5 weeks, which is far different than what we had historically. And with customers who are already full IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage customers, meaning that they're already using all the parts and therefore, we're full partners with them, we can have a conversation about how to grow their practice. And we've got a lot of different tools already that have been fully in the portfolio to help them do so. And the customers are really resonating with that conversation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Jon and Merilee, you gave many reasons for the reacceleration of revenue growth throughout 2013, which was very helpful. But can you talk to what, if any, expectations there are for share losses to this called the altered distribution either in chemistry or rapid as we enter the back part of the year? I mean, what are you guys building into the internal plans over the next several quarters?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, thank you. We've been carefully monitoring the situation with the new distribution arrangement that we have with one of our national distributors. And we are very pleased by the way with the performance of all of our distributors in the new -- in 2013. In particular, we're pleased with our nonexclusive distributor, which actually had a growth of IDEXX diagnostics that was higher than average for all distributors, which is -- really shows that I think we've retained the engagement of all our distributors in supporting our customers in adopting our innovations. And so as we monitor this very carefully, we don't see any share loss and quite frankly, we don't expect any share loss. And the reason is because we've got, historically, great loyalty with our customer base. We've executed very well. And we just look at the numbers for the instrument consumables and the rapid assay growth. And even without the change in our sales structure, we would expect that to continue. But one of the big benefits we believe of this transformation and being much more customer-centric is that we will have even higher loyalty of our customer base because we're going to be calling on them every 5 weeks and supporting them, including our existing customer base. So we haven't seen any evidence. And I think it's because -- what is the real thing here? Distributors are valued partners, but they're really supplemental. The primary role here is for IDEXX to grow the business and the distributors play a helpful secondary role. But they're not a primary driver of new instrument placements or the medical messenger, things like that, that we do. So we really don't really see this as a very big change and of course, it does also give us the opportunity to take some of the savings with the change in margin to reinvest in our sales organization and grow the number of feet on the street, as I mentioned in the opening comments.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. That's very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on that sales change. The timing is interesting. In other words, can you phrase it for us whether you view it as offensive as you've got Pet Health Pro, you've got VetConnect PLUS, you've got stuff that maybe if you're pushing can really lead to better utilization if you highlight those benefits to your customer base or again, just the timing, I mean, one quarter into an alter distribution agreement? Is it somewhat defensive in nature that you've got to spend more time in front of your customers, you've got to increase the times that you're calling on them because you've now got a nationwide distributor that's not exclusive from exclusive?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, I see it as really a way to step up our presence in customers, I guess, if I have to pick between the 2 in an offensive way, but I think it's a natural outgrowth of our strategy now in the diagnostic lines that what we're providing is highly relevant medical information that's really in large degree, common across the in-house and reference lab modalities. And it's so apparent when all that information is fed into VetConnect PLUS. And so we really see this sales transformation is -- we're in a perfect position to be able to do this because it's aligned with our overall strategy. And so we're quite enthusiastic. This is in no way I think related to the change in distribution. It made sense as the evolution of our product line became more and more integrated. And it's just coincident now that it happens to happen with this change of distribution, which we really see as a pretty small factor as we look at our commercial and channel strategy in the U.S. We're recognizing -- by the way, we're making the same change in Canada and that has no change in -- there's nothing changed in the distribution side in Canada and yet, we see the same opportunity. And in fact, we've already made this change in some of our countries outside the U.S., which helped us inform both the benefits of the change and how to make the change. And so it's really been an evolution of IDEXX that is independent and coincident with the large focus investors have had on the changes in U.S. distribution.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One last quick one, if for no other reason to point it at Merilee and say, \"Marilee, thanks for your help throughout the years.\" But just a quick one, lower revenues, I think you talked about gross margins up 50 bps, OpEx will be hit by 100 bps. I wasn't clear if that was a function of the bankruptcy. In other words, you're netting out largely the same on EPS after all the adjustments. Can you talk to how that's possible with what I just laid out to you, accelerating the share repo or does that OpEx up 100 bps factor in the bankruptcy?","Merilee Raines","Well, first, thanks for your well wishes. And I would say with the operating expenses, that really -- the increase of 100 basis points versus January is largely due to the fact that of lower revenues and spending staying relatively on par. And Trendset has an impact in the first quarter, but over the full year, it's a very minimal impact to the OpEx percentage. And so what we do see going on are a couple of things in the couple of pennies that we have related to business performance that we've reduced the high end of our range by about $0.02 related to business performance. So as you'd indicated, we do have...","Jonathan W. Ayers","Have an increase to low end.","Merilee Raines","And we've raised the low end by $0.02. So but the -- with regard the $0.02 at the high end, that is really a netting of we have some favorability, higher favorability than previously anticipated due to a lower share count and a somewhat lower tax rate and then that is offset by a reduction in operating profits due to the lower organic revenue growth guidance that we provided.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First one for me, I was just curious given the commentary on decelerating vet market growth, vet patient growth in the quarter. I was just hoping you could maybe give us some details on what your expectations are from a macro perspective for North America and Europe included in the guidance.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Well our really -- our expectation going into the year was that there wouldn't be much improvement in the economy over the trends we had seen in 2012. Every quarter can have its own story. I think first quarter was particularly impacted by weather, but I think that's not a fundamental secular issue. I think that was an issue within the quarter. So our outlook is modest growth in the profession, similar to what we had in 2012. But of course, we did want to give commentary on the quarter.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then...","Jonathan W. Ayers","And I'm just -- to answer your question on Europe, Europe is a lot of different economies as it turns out. But overall, we're not counting on much going on economically in Europe and yet, Europe is also, for us, Eastern Europe and Middle East, Africa, I mean, we've got a number of emerging markets in there. And so overall, we're actually pretty -- we're pretty optimistic about our opportunity in Europe. Don't ask me about Italy, for example, but that's just one country in a whole portfolio of countries there. So we're -- we have some core successes in big countries and in emerging markets.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned expectations for less than 5% sales force turnover as a result of the changes that you're implementing. Just curious, was there any turnover following the first 20% conversion that you did in April?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well, the 5% is the total. What we did, to be clear, is as a result of all this planning. We told the sales force about all the new territories, okay? So everybody knows how they're affected, whether they're in the new territory in April or they're new in their new territory in July or they have to move to be in the new territory. And so we've had -- already have all the conversations with all of our sales reps, and we know for those that have -- it's basically those that have to move, for those who have to move, which ones are willing to move to a new territory and which one that's that not going to be possible. And we sorted all that out in entirety. We believe it's less than 5%, pretty good metrics on that.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Good. And the hematology business, so what's the strategy to reaccelerate growth there? And I'm sorry I missed it, what were the chemistry placements up in North America in the quarter?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Let me just -- while Merilee gets the chemistry -- the hematology. We have a -- we really have a unique hematology line between ProCyte and LaserCyte, particularly with the new LaserCyte Dx. And I think it's -- so really, if this is not a product issue, it's -- in the U.S., I think we really focused on chemistry placements in Q1, and really exceeded our expectations in the quality and the quantity. And the quality of placements, as measured by the size of accounts and the number in the new accounts to IDEXX and all that. I think with this new IDEXX diagnostics sales structure, hematology, we will be able to have the ability to talk to customers about the importance of hematology, in-house hematology, as part of having a full diagnostic portfolio. And let's recognize that while -- while chemistry has always been, for quite some time, highly penetrated in veterinary practices. Not the same for hematology. There's not the same -- it's well penetrated, but it's not, by any means, fully penetrated. And so there's greenfield opportunity in hematology and I think with this new structure, we're going to have a better chance to be able to talk to customers about the role that we'll play in growing the practice.","Merilee Raines","And David, I just wanted to get back on your question about chemistry placements in North American in the first quarter. They were -- the total placements were down about 5%. This was actually below what we have projected for a decline. We projected to be closer to 10%. And the reason we were projecting a decline is that the protocol-based rebate programs that we had launched in the back half of 2011. So -- and really in Q3 2011, we saw a very strong placement growth for those, not only in the back half of 2011, but also into the first quarter of 2012. And then the program, the impact started to tail off. So we did anticipate somewhat of a difficult compare for chemistry placements in the first quarter of this year for North America.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Then just one quick last one before I ask this, thanks for all your help over the years, Merilee. But can you give us an update on how the new CFO search is going?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, let me cover that. We are actively recruiting. I think we're going to -- we're recruiting primarily outside candidates and although we have a very -- Merilee does lead a very strong second level team of finance within IDEXX, which is going to serve us well. As we continue the recruitment, we've talked to a number of very strong candidates and yet with any recruitment, it's not over until someone has signed and ready to come. So it's a very active process and we're confident we're going to have a great addition on -- to fill that role, just as we achieved in the recruitment of our General Counsel, which we announced a couple of weeks ago. Jeff Fiarman, who will be joining us next week. So we're excited about his arrival.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you quantify or comment anecdotally how much price realization the new lab in Germany and going direct to Nordic countries is actually contributing to your new organic growth guidance range and what sort of underlying fundamental utilization trends you are assuming?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Let me just comment on Nordic. Nordic has 2 factors, which are driving that greater than 35% growth. One is go direct, but we're also seeing good volumes and we're seeing a pickup in volumes. And remember that, that number includes the portion that we've previously gone through a distributor as well as the lab services, which had always been direct. So that was a Companion Animal Group diagnostic numbers that included the mix and despite the fact that only part of that went from distributor direct and the other part was direct all along, we've seen that good growth is because of both the price and volume and the response to customers by having our direct sales organization there.","Merilee Raines","Erin, I would say with those initiatives and remembering that they're going to continue to gain momentum over a number of quarters, those are contributing probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 million to $10 million in total growth for the year. So they're a small portion of the many different contributors we have to grow for the year.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as it relates to the sales force transformation, I know you've spoken to a lot of the questions there. But how should we, I guess, think about the quarterly progression of incremental costs associated with that? And has this sales force change been in development or in your kind of thought process over several years? Or has this been something that's more new?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well, I would say that we have thought about this type of change for a long time. And have evaluated it versus our prior, more specialized strategies. So this was something that we've thought about for a long time. I think what we realized though was with the introduction of VetConnect PLUS, it became so apparent that we have -- to the customer and to our sales and to our sales force, to everybody that it really is a common diagnostic offering supported by multiple modalities. That really tipped the scale to the benefits of this structure versus the benefits of the prior structure. In addition, as we talked to our customers and we talked to our sales organization, this was something that -- and we consider it the change. This was something that they were very positive on. I mean, they were -- this was a -- in large part, it really came from the field. And so of course, you don't undertake a change like this without a lot of consideration and then a lot of planning. And so we've been in the planning stage on this for almost a year and then in very detailed implementation of it for the last 6 months. It's like a product launch, if you will. And I'll tell you, I am just extremely pleased by the role that our Jay Mazelsky, our Executive Vice President, supported by Johnny Powers and our entire North American commercial organization. They've worked really hard to make this a success because they all know it's the right thing to do. So I hope that answers your question.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. No, it does.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Frelick from Canaccord Genuity.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Jon, just to be clear on the changes with the sales force, just really curious on how you're going to measure and manage this. Is this really looking at each territory and what their growth is? You're looking at other reps adding new customers. I'm just curious how that ties into the sales comp and if you can share anything on the comp plan, that'd be helpful as well.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, ultimately -- that's a great question, Jeff. Thank you for that. The great thing about this new structure is that I think we'll have real ownership by our sales professionals in their territory for the growth of IDEXX diagnostics. And that's going to help in, really, the 3 drivers of growth, which is adding modality and having a customer add a modality that they did not have before. So moving to our reference lab, maybe they had our in-house, but they didn't have a reference lab or maybe they had our reference lab and they didn't have the in-house. That's a big driver of growth. Ensuring customer loyalty by supporting them and then driving growth in utilization of their diagnostics from IDEXX by things like preventive care and other protocols that really help advance the standard of care that the hospital's practicing and achieving their mission. So adding modalities, ensuring high loyalty and growth in utilization. This is -- this rep is going to be able to drive growth through all 3 of those. Now, obviously, there are specific elements to that and what isn't going to change is that we fully expect -- in fact, we see opportunity that, we did not -- were not fully taking advantage of before in that the majority of our customers, you just take the in-house instruments and the reference labs. It's pretty surprising that the majority of our customers use one but not both. You would think that it would be more difficult to get them to use the first than it would be to fill out the portfolio with the full IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage. And yet, that's in fact what we've done. We've done with our specialized sales force the work of getting a lot of customers to use 1 of those 2 modalities and of course, most of our customers use our rapid assays in some fashion. And now with this new structure, we will have the opportunity to fill out. And so that's going to, I think, be a significant long-term opportunity for growth, very aligned with our strategy of providing highly relevant medical information through our diagnostic modalities.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You all have answered a lot already, but I'll just list 2 or 3 very quick questions, if I could, and answer as time permits. But I wonder if you could review again some of the reasons that your expectations for hematology placements had come down over the course of this year. And closely related to that, I just wondered if you could comment on how ProCyte placements have been developing compared to your expectations? And the final question I had was VetConnect PLUS, now that it's -- it's been out there for a few more months and in more accounts. Just whether you could give any incremental color as to how that might be having an impact on customer retention and maybe even on new customer wins as well.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Good, thank you. Those are great questions. With regard to hematology, I think one of the things that hematology does for us is, it helps us gain or grow an account that is using our in-house instrument modality. And one of the things that ProCyte has done for us is allow us to bring accounts for both hematology and chemistry because they see the highly differentiated value of ProCyte, both medically and in terms of workflow. I mean, there's really just nothing like it. And so -- but the issue with hematology indeed, all instrument placement is there is an upfront cost and there's a lot of -- a lot more consumable volume that comes with a chemistry placement 4, 5x than there is a hematology placement. So we've rightly focused on the chemistry side, but we see hematology as an important supplementary element to the growth strategy. And so I think it's reflective of that. Merilee, do you have more comments on hematology before I turn to the VetConnect PLUS question?","Merilee Raines","Again, part of the bringing the growth down, Ross, is obviously, a function of the growth in the first quarter was off from what we had expected, so we a bit had expected kind of a mid-single-digit placement growth, and so with the number that we reported, that's a piece of it. We also see and project that we're going to have some very nice acceleration in growth internationally. And we think there's just a lot of opportunity there. But I think we just want to be a little bit more conservative about that growth prospect outside the U.S. as well.","Jonathan W. Ayers","And then to your question -- again, thank you for the question. On VetConnect PLUS, we were pleased to see continued, very significant growth in the number of customers who've activated VetConnect PLUS up to 6,700 from 4,500 at our last call. So continuing at the same pace it did in the first 2 quarters of its introduction. And I think what is even really now more profound is that our customers, the key opinion leaders, our sales organization, our medical, our professional service veterinarians, they're all -- the introduction of Pet Health Network Pro and the benefit of sharing medical information and diagnostic information with pet owners, the trend towards preventative care that's been a big theme of independent groups such as the American Animal Hospital Association is that we're beginning to see the realization about how profound a change it is when you have access to a patient's diagnostic information in a value-added, electronic way through VetConnect PLUS and the ability to analyze, to share with the pet owner electronically and directly in the exam and also through email or other ways of electronically sharing. So much easier to do that. And then the insight about really what this is doing to profoundly change the standard of care that can be practiced in veterinary medicine, that is a much larger kind of thing. And that doesn't happen overnight. But what we've seen is over this quarter is, I think, for example, in particular, our sales organization really got how to have that conversation with customers and how that helps the customers meet the needs they see in their practice to provide client value and to make -- to continue to help their practice be relevant in this world that we live in, where you have online pharmacies and a lot of other things that are challenging the veterinary practice. And so that is a much larger trend that I think will, like anything in veterinary medicine, it'll take time to really penetrate the consciousness of practicing veterinarians around the country, indeed, around the world because we would expect to continue to roll this out globally over the next 18 months or so. And so I feel very, very good about what we're seeing about the penetration in the consciousness of that change. But it -- we are early days. We are very, very early days. If somebody asked me what innings since the baseball season already start, we're inning are you -- we're still in the first inning here. Although, we've changed the game, we were previously playing at every game. Now, we're playing a game of value of diagnostic information as opposed to selling a box or a courier service. And so I think we have a long runway ahead of us, and we're early days. But clearly, it's impacting the ability to win customers, a modality not previously been using IDEXX, and it's improving our retention for customers who are operationalizing, VetConnect inside their practice and are seeing the benefits. And so we believe it will be very supportive of the 3 key elements of growth in our annuity business model of additional modalities, retention and growth in utilization.","Okay. I think that's all the calls. I want to thank everybody else. I want to take this opportunity to my deep appreciation for Merilee. Merilee has been at the company for, I think, it's some -- I'm probably going to get this off by a year, but 25 years, and she has been our Chief Financial Officer over a decade. And that's a long time for anyone in today's world. And we've just had a tremendous -- a period of growing the company and bringing the values to -- bring value to our customers and bringing value to our shareholders in the process over that period of time. And I'm deeply grateful for the partnership that we've had. And I wish her luck in her retirement, and we're confident that even though she has big shoes to fill that we will be able to find somebody who will bring maybe not Merilee's unique set of skills because really no one can replace Merilee, but a new set of skills that will take us to the next phase of our growth. So with that, thanks to Merilee and thanks to our investors, and thanks to our organization for accomplishments.

IDEXX delivered continued strong financial performance in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $620 million grew 7% on a reported basis or 9% organically. Results were driven by continued strong 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a combined 0.5% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts. The quality of our growth was excellent in the quarter, reflected in strong U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities. And 39% growth in new and competitive Catalysts placements in international markets, which supported solid global EVI gains and continue to high growth and consumable revenues.","Profit performance continued at a strong pace in Q2 supported by continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and high profit flow through. EPS was $1.43 per share, an increase of 19% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting a better than projected 120 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins. In addition to strong operating profit gains, Q2 EPS results also benefited from $0.04 per share, an upside related to share-based compensation tax benefits.","While, our CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth remains strong and on track with our full year 11% to 12% growth goals, our overall Q2 organic growth of 9% was at the lower end of our projected growth range for the quarter, impacted by a few select factors. We fell short of our goals to build on very high prior year international chemistry upgrade levels with the majority of our Q2 upgrade placement shortfall in China. We also saw increased pressure on China LPD revenues in Q2, driven by the African swine fever outbreak, as well as a relatively higher than projected impact from Brexit and equivalent day affects in the quarter.","These factors were largely specific to the second quarter. We\u2019ve refined our full your revenue outlook to incorporate these effects, while raising our full year EPS guidance, reflecting continued benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and discipline P&L management.","In terms of our full year revenue outlook, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance for 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We\u2019re refining our overall organic growth guidance to 9.5% to 10.5%, lowering our high-end growth outlook by 0.5%, incorporating our second quarter results. Our updated full year revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million, $10 million below our prior midpoint revenue range reflecting, $5 million in operational refinements and approximately $5 million of impacts related to updated FX estimates.","We\u2019re raising our 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.5 per share at midpoint to $4.82 to $4.92, or 17% to 20% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This outlook reflects $0.02 in EPS benefit at midpoint related to higher expectations for operating performance driven by a raised outlook for 100 to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement and lower projected interest expense. Our guidance builds in $0.04 per share increase from updated projections for share-based compensation tax benefits, incorporating Q2 upsides, offset by $0.01 negative impacts related to updated FX assumptions.","We\u2019ll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Q2 results reflected a continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $547 million, up 10% organically driven by 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including strong global gains across our major modalities. As noted, our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in the quarter was net of 0.5% headwind from Brexit order timing and equivalent day effects, which were relatively greater than anticipated impacted by the timing of European holidays.","Year-to-date CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.4% in line with our full year goals. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 9% overall and 7% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit organic gains in VSS revenues. We saw continued strong sales results across our practice management platforms and growth in recurring software services on our expanding PIMS and application installed base.","Our diagnostic imaging business also continues to achieve high levels of digital radiography instrument placements and growth in recurring services, although our organic revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by comparisons to high prior year instrument placement levels.","Our Water business revenues grew 10% organically in the second quarter to $35 million with consistent mid-single digit growth in the U.S., augmented by high growth in Asia and Latin America, aided by our expanded direct sales presence.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $33 million, reflecting relatively flat organic growth. Strong organic growth and health herd screening revenues aided by a favorable prior year comparison in the quarter and solid gains in poultry and pregnancy testing were offset by greater than projected pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from African swine fever \u2013 the African swine fever epidemic in China, as well as moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues.","By region, U.S. revenues are $389 million in the quarter, up 9% organically, driven by an 11% organic increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by double-digit growth in U.S. Reference Labs and consumables and high-single digit gains in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume driven with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range across our major modalities.","IDEXX growth continues to outpace broader market trends. In Q2, total visits per practice growth was 0.7% year-on-year, with clinical visits per practice growing at a greater amount at 2.1%, and overall revenue per practice increasing 4.4%. Market growth results were slightly moderated from Q1 levels, which were refined following our latest dataset refresh. Note that these metrics are on the same-store basis and don\u2019t include growth benefits from incremental practice formation which we estimated approximately 1% annually. International revenues in Q2 were $230 million, up 9% organically, driven by 11% organic gains and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.","As noted last quarter, we saw benefits in Q1 related to advanced ordering ahead of the previous Brexit deadline. These effects reversed in the second quarter, which along with an unfavorable impact related to the timing of European holidays, reduce overall international CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains by approximately 1.5% and consumable gains by [indiscernible]","Adjusting for this dynamic, international consumer gains were nearly 20% in Q2, supported by our commercial executional focus and expanding our global Catalyst installed base. International CAG Diagnostic revenue gains were moderated by consistent mid-single digit revenue gains in our Reference Lab business. This is an area targeted for improvement in the second half of 2019, aided by relatively more favorable year-on-year comparisons and benefits from our expanding veterinary diagnostic consultant business model.","In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results reflected strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and continued progress and expanding our premium installed equipment based globally. Globally EVI was up solidly in Q2 compared to very strong prior year levels, driven by growth in high quality Catalyst placements. In North America, we placed 319 Catalysts at new and competitive accounts, as well as 159 second Catalysts at larger IDEXX accounts.","Second Catalyst placements are supporting continued strong consumable growth and high customer retention rates, aided by steadily expanding 360 degree program and other long-term contract commitments. These results compare to strong prior year, new and competitive Catalysts placement levels of 346 units and 95 second Catalysts placements. Along with limited VetTest upgrades, total North American Catalyst placements were 486 in the quarter, up 8% supporting a 15% year-on-year growth in our North American installed base, including approximately 5% of growth benefit from upgrades completed in the second half of 2018 at Banfield.","In international markets, we placed 761 Catalyst at new and competitive accounts, or 66% of total placements, up 213 units or 39% compared to the prior year. Total international Catalysts placements of 1,149 units were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year levels, which had high levels of VetTest upgrades in Asia-Pacific markets.","As noted, while our new and competitive Catalyst results were excellent, we did fall short of our goals in Q2 to build on our high priority levels of upgrades in expansion markets such as China, which contributed to a shortfall to our quarterly instrument revenue goals. Despite these dynamics, our international Catalyst installed base reached nearly 21,000 units in Q2, up 28% year-on-year and over 5% compared to ending Q1 levels.","Overall, we placed 3,171 premium analyzers in Q2, down 2% year-on-year. Total Catalyst placements were 1,635, down 1% reflecting the tough compared to high prior year VetTest upgrade levels. We achieved 602 SediVue placements in Q2, down 16% compared to very strong prior year levels, which benefited from a high percentage of our early 360 degree program agreements, including seven new compared to a more recent mix shift, which has included relatively more Catalyst as part of our 360 program commitments.","We placed 934 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter, up 7% with a continued high attach rate with new and competitive Catalysts placements. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed a record 2,663 SNAP Pros in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 30,000, with over 27,000 installed in North America, helping to support increasing retention rates in our rapid assay business.","CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 were $32 million, a decrease of 7% organically off a strong compare in 2018, which included mixed benefits from very strong placements of higher priced SediVue instruments.","Benefits from a growing instrument base, test and software innovation and expanded direct commercial capability continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities. Instrument consumable revenues of $175 million, grew 13% organically in Q2, net of 1% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts.","Results reflect double-digit gains in the U.S. and normalized growth nearly 20% in international markets. High volume-driven consumable gains were supported by continued expansion of SediVue and SDMA in a slide with each contributing nearly 1% to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.","Reference Laboratory and consulting services revenues of $214 million, grew 10% organically into Q2. U.S. lab momentum continues to be very strong reflected in low- to mid-teen volume driven organic Reference Lab revenue gains and sustained high customer retention levels. Overall lab growth was moderated by consistent mid-single digit organic lab growth in international markets.","Rapid assay revenues of $69 million, grew 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx Plus specialty and first generation products supported by planned promotional programs and high customer retention levels, aided by our expanded SNAP Pro installed base. Rapid assay gains continued to be primarily volume driven, augmented by moderate net price gains.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $164 million, up 13% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis, supported by operating margin gains across our CAG order and LPD segments. Operating margins were 26.5%, up 120 basis points on a constant currency basis or 140 basis points as reported reflecting moderate gross margin gains and stronger than projected operating expense leverage.","Gross profit was $358 million in Q2, up 8% as reported or 9% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was $57.7%, increased 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by product margin gains, reflecting benefits from moderate net price increases and strong consumable and rapid assayed growth. These gains and scale and productivity benefits in our U.S. lab business were offset by plan investments in lab capacity and systems, as well as incremental year-on-year costs associated with expanded software field service resources Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit, were approximately $2.5 million in Q2.","Operating expenses in Q2 were up 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis resulting in 90 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending and increased costs related to our expanded global commercial infrastructure with some favorability related \u2013 relative to our expectations for the quarter relative to the ramping of cost growth in these areas.","Overall operating expense growth was moderated in Q2 by relatively limited constant currency growth in G&A costs reflecting low year-on-year corporate function and benefit costs growth and LPD cost controls. EPS in Q2 was a $1.43 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 19% on a comparable constant currency basis. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q2 2018 and 2019 decreased operating profit by [indiscernible] million and EPS by $0.01 per share. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% in Q2, including benefits of approximately 3% to our tax rate or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which is approximately $0.04 per share, higher than projected.","Free cash flow was $99 million for the first half of 2019. We continue to expect free cash flow at 60% to 65% of net income for 2019, reflecting a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $160 million to $175 million. This includes approximately $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook Maine headquarters expansion in our German core lab relocation or about 20% of net income. We allocated $20 million in capital to repurchase 86,000 shares and Q2.","Year-to-date, we repurchased 353,000 shares or $74 million or an average price of $210 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q2 to with $956 million in debt, $111 million in cash, and $597 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.49 times gross, and 1.31 times net of cash and investment balances.","We\u2019re refining our 2019 full year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which reflects more recent stock price trends and assumes that we maintain net leverage ratios at current levels. We now project annual interest expense of approximately $34 million, an improvement of $2 million more than offsetting these impacts.","In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, our full year reported revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million, reflecting refined expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic growth and consistent 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our reported revenue outlook reflects a projected 1.5% to 2% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release.","As noted, we\u2019re raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance $0.05 per share at mid point to $4.82 to $4.92 reflecting an outlook for 17% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth. Refinements to our revenue outlook or more than offset by increased expectations for full year operating margin improvement, now projected at 100 basis points to 125 basis points, generating $0.02 of operational benefits including net upsize from revised projections for full year interest expense in share account reduction.","Our EPS guidance assumes at 2019 effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance lending $0.04 of reported EPS upside. This tax rate includes an estimate of $12 million to $14 million or approximately 2.5% and projected a full year tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. At midpoint of our guidance estimates \u2013 this equates to about $0.15 per share in full year benefit. We now estimate the foreign exchange rate changes will decrease EPS, reported EPS by $0.04 per share, $0.01 greater than \u2013 a $0.01 greater impact in our last outlook head of approximately $11.5 million in projected hedge gains.","For the third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% and organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 12% including 1% to 1.5% equivalent day growth benefit. We expect Q3 2019 operating margins to increase 50 basis points to 100 basis points above prior year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis, and we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be approximately 21% including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity.","That concludes the financial review, our business momentum remains strong and we\u2019re on track to deliver our 2019 financial performance aligned with our long term goals.","Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.","Jay Mazelsky","Good morning and thank you, Brian. IDEXX second quarter results build on our strong start to 2019, and reflect the strength of our recurring revenue business model, keeping us on track towards excellent full year results aligned with our long term goals. Our performance was led by solid 11% organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, or 11.5% normalized for Q1 Brexit pooling and equivalent day impacts. This expanding highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXXs total revenues in Q2.","Let me start with a few reflections on the quarter. We were especially pleased with the strength of our U.S. performance in Q2, where we drove 11% recurring CAG growth, reflecting strong gains across all CAG recurring diagnostic modalities. We saw continued momentum in our U.S. reference lab business, whereas previously communicated, we continued to invest in operational enhancements such as new courier routes, new day labs, and weekend service. These investments provide service level and results, turnaround improvements, both of which support customer retention and new customer acquisition.","In our North American VetLab business, Catalysts placements were up 8% including second Catalysts placed at high testing volume accounts, which also support customer retention and help drive continued double-digit consumable gains. Of note, the rapid assay business grew at 9% organically benefiting from superior clinical accuracy, effective promotional programs and improving customer retention. The business was also aided by our expanding SNAP Pro installed base, an increasing leverage of IDEXX multimodality testing capability.","Reinforcing our long held premise the test that indicates testing; we\u2019re seeing strong evidence of faster rapid assay 4Dx Plus growth, and IDEXX practices that also use our lab services and are adopting Preventive Care protocols. Globally instrument placements were solid during the quarter, considering tough compares at overall quality, with notable strength in international competitive Catalysts placements, which were up 39%. Our premium installed base continues to expand nicely, and we don\u2019t see a change in the competitive environment. These placement gains along with ongoing increases in testing utilization drove continued strong growth in international consumables.","International consumable sales were up nearly 20% normalized for the impact of Brexit order timing and equivalent days aligned with our strategy to develop this significant in-clinic opportunity in international markets. Continued solid momentum across our business is keeping us on track for 11% to 12% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue gains this year, and comparable constant currency EPS gains at the high end of our long-term goals.","Let me share some additional highlights related to progress on key fronts in our growth strategy. We continue to make solid progress advancing IDEXX Preventive Care. Our high same-store sales growth at the practice level in our U.S. Labs business is being driven in part by the adoption of Preventive Care diagnostics, what we call IDEXX Preventive Care. To date through Q2, over 3,100 practices have enrolled in the Preventive Care program since its inception. With 370 new practices enrolled in the quarter, a quarterly high for first time enrollees. IDEXX Preventive Care practices are growing CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 14% on a trailing 12-month basis versus 11% growth for IDEXX U.S. customer base over the same period","Virtually our entire VDC population in the U.S is now successfully partnered with customers in their territories to deliver IDEXX Preventive Care. In fact, the top 50% of our VDC population as ranked by their engagement in Preventive Care exceeded their first half territory revenue goals by approximately 200 basis points. It\u2019s a great example of how we create market growth. We always start with the customer and patient need to understand where appropriately applying IDEXX Diagnostics, like fecal antigen and IDEXX SDMA can uncover four underlying disease.","In the case of preventative care, we bring the relevant test together to create Preventive Care protocols. That closely aligned with how customers consume diagnostics testing along with compliance driven pricing that support the practice of best medicine. We leverage big data to raise awareness in practice centers, showing the medical benefits of applying appropriate diagnostics testing for Preventive Care to all pets, not just the older dogs and cats. Our field organization also plays an important role in customer success and market growth. Representing a key reason, we went to a high frequency trusted advisor model. We\u2019re able to invest time and resources to help customers achieve their patient and business goals.","In early Q3, we introduced our IDEXX anywhere urine analysis bundle, available exclusively to IDEXX Preventive Care customers. This offering combines the convenience and pricing of Preventive Care diagnostics run at the reference lab, with all the clinical advantages of fresh year running in-house on the city view. This innovation is enabled by our unique integration capabilities between the IDEXX VetLab station, practice management software, and the IDEXX reference lab providing to customers, a seamless ordering and billing experience across modalities. We believe this multimodality customer friendly solution could help further accelerate our Preventive Care momentum. It helps support said of you placements and associated utilization.","We continue to have exceptional performance with our SNAP Pro placements of over 2,300 placed in the second quarter in the U.S. alone, up 100% year-over-year. We continue to methodically transform our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model. As the SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. We see higher growth and rapid assay loyalty with customers adopt this SNAP Pro active and connected workflow. With the placements in Q2, we are now just a bit south of 65% of our SNAP 4Dx plus revenue, coming from these active and connected SNAP Pro customers.","I\u2019d also like to provide an update on the status of our international sales force expansion. Our international business performance is strong. As evidenced by the continued high growth and economic value of instrument placements and International CAG recurring growth at 12.5% in Q2, adjusted for approximately 1.5% combined headwind for Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts.","We\u2019ve now completed the second full quarter within the expanded model and the commercial teams are responding well. Having had responsibility for three such initiatives in the U.S., there\u2019s a time and distant element to building out the expansion. As we onboard new sales professionals develop their expertise in diagnostics and our product offering and grow their customer relationships. We track key metrics on our progress like tenure, which jump nicely in Q2. Since experience correlates well with effectiveness. We expect to see further business benefits of these efforts in the second half consistent with our experience in U. S. Where we feel effectiveness increased every quarter with tenure and deeper customer relationships","Moving to the veterinary software portfolio, Q2 was another very strong quarter for global placements, Cornerstone, Neo and Animana systems. In North America, practice management software placements grew 44% year-over-year for the quarter. Neo recently launched in Canada in Australia, complimenting Cornerstone in both of those markets.","Speaking at Cornerstone, we continue to see an unprecedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades to version 9.1 driven by customer excitement for the modernized user interface and disease. We have upgraded close to 2,000 Cornerstone users in less than four months. A record and testament to customer enthusiasm and a place to share that we achieved a critical technical milestone in the development of Cornerstone cloud, currently in field testing, which we\u2019ll make available in the future and will bring the many benefits of the cloud to customers that value Cornerstone, as the go to high end practice management system.","Q2 was also a strong quarter for Web PACS, one of our nine cloud-based softwares and service offerings, which experienced that 34% year-over-year increase in enrollments. Other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including the development of an enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate customers.","In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across the range of strategic fronts, and believe we are well positioned to sustain strong recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth and EPS gains aligned with our goals. We look forward to sharing more about the enduring growth potential we see for our business in our long-term strategy to capture this potential at the upcoming Investor day later this month.","Before I conclude, I wanted to extend our best wishes to Jon Ayers, as he works through his rehabilitation process. The strong results, we continued to deliver reflected deep and talented team that Jon has developed at IDEXX. And I know he has great confidence in IDEXX to keep delivering against our purpose in potential.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the call. I want to start on the Reference Lab. The overall numbers, I mean, that was one area that came in a little bit lighter relative to expectations. And you talked a little bit about the U.S. performance and how well that held in, but international it seems like continues to lag just a little bit. I wonder if there\u2019s anything going on there. I mean, we\u2019ve talked in the past about the EVI and the focus on the point of care offering, but I want to see if the dynamic changed at all. And I wonder if there was any impact of the heat wave in Europe like we\u2019ve seen in the past or anything like that?","Brian McKeon","Yes, Mike. Why don\u2019t I just kind of clarify the numbers? But the Reference Labs trends in Q2 were very consistent with what we saw in Q1. I think here we have some normalization going on, but the U.S. was \u2013 the Q1 was 14%. It was like 13% normalized in Q2, and we had mid-single, very consistent mid-single digit gains in international. So we didn\u2019t have a change in trend and Jay can talk more about this, but as you know, we\u2019ve been sort of signaling target improvement as we work through the year on the international labs and we will have some more favorable comparison, but Jay can expand on that.","Jay Mazelsky","Yes, just some additional context heading. Our overall business performance internationally was quite strong. We saw the 12.5% normalized CAG recurring growth performance. And as Brian indicated in his remarks, really strong competitive and placements associated economic value with the international consumables growth at nearly 20% normalized. So overall, very good performance. As I indicated, we\u2019re still in the process of building out the VDC expansion and I think time is as our VDC has continued to build relationships with their customers in the market and we know with time comes additional effectiveness.","Keep in mind that we start with very strong country organizations. A lot of our sales professionals and country managers in international have been with the company, and know diagnostics for a decade or two decades. So that\u2019s the base where we are building off of. In additional, they are representing phenomenal product line across the broad-based diagnostics offering. So we\u2019re feeling good and about where we are and expect to continue to build off that capability in the second half.","Brian McKeon","And just to reinforce something Mike on performance versus expectations, we felt very good about the recurring CAG growth in the quarter. If you\u2019d normalize the effects we highlighted, it was 11.5%. That\u2019s where we are year-to-date, that\u2019s right in range with what we are trying to achieve, fee for the full year. So relative to what we were targeting, this was an area that was right on line with what we\u2019re hoping to achieve.","Michael Ryskin","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And a quick follow-up if I could. I\u2019ve gotten a flurry of your questions, since you brought up the comments on China. That was a little bit surprising. Could you just walk us through what happened there? What do you saw in the quarter? What your expectations are for the rest of the year?","Brian McKeon","Yes, we had a couple of effects that were related to China. Let me break them down and maybe LPD is the easier one to start with. But we\u2019ve been working through the Africans swine fever impact. As you know China is not a big part of our overall company revenues. It\u2019s 2.6% last year, roughly evenly split between LPD and CAG and \u2013 but within the LPD business, the swine testing business in China is a meaningful part of our LPD revenues, and we saw an acceleration in decline on the African swine fever from the Q1 levels. It\u2019s a business it\u2019s a little tougher to predict.","We can \u2013 we sell into larger laboratories and so it\u2019s a little less visibility than some of other assets of our business, but that was a couple of $1 million below what we were expecting to achieve in the quarter, and we feel like we\u2019ve got that reason to calibrate it. We\u2019ve got some other initiatives we are advancing to mitigate that and we\u2019ve got some promising trends in other parts of the business, health herd screening that we feel good about. So I think the \u2013 net-net we think we\u2019ve got that factored in but that was a surprise in Q2.","On the instrument placements, we had excellent competitive instrument placements in China. The challenge that we had was, we had very strong prior year VetTest upgrades as well and I think in retrospect, we probably had overly aggressive goals going into this year to both to make progress on the competitive \u2013 new competitive front and to build on the strong upgrades. So it\u2019s always been a competitive market, wouldn\u2019t necessarily relate to softness in the market per se, I think, with some more as I mentioned, retrospect that we probably had aggressive goals here. But I think that\u2019s another point of context. So China is smaller for us overall, but I think in the quarter, had some impacts, but we feel we\u2019ve got that calibrated in the updated outlook.","Michael Ryskin","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Daniels","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And I\u2019ll also start by wishing Jon the best in his rehabilitation. Jay, maybe one for you, you talked about the record enrollment of, I think 370 practices in the IDEXX Preventive Care program. Can you speak a little bit towards what\u2019s driving that? It seems a little bit unique, I think, we typically see kind of a rapid growth in early adopters and then slowly in the vet space. So what\u2019s driving such strong momentum there for your business?","Jay Mazelsky","Sure. Thank you, Ryan, for the question. We think it really starts with a fact that there is a very sizable market opportunity and I\u2019m going to refer my comments specifically to North America in the U.S. We think that the U.S. Preventive Care market, addressable market is about $3 billion, we saw about $1 billion and that have served in \u2013 and we have about a third of that. So we\u2019re still in the \u2013 in our early stages of being able to develop this marketplace.","And then you look at just sort of benchmark and provide some background context on the opportunity, a fairly small percentage of Companion Animals are getting tested today. We have cited statistics and data in the past that about 15% of dogs come in to a practice for clinical visits undergo a chemistry test, only 15%. On the vector-borne disease side, a little over third. So 36% canines in any given year get some sort of vector-borne disease screened. This could be something as basic as heartworm, only 15% are getting the full vector-borne disease screened before the act. So that stats with a very sizable opportunity.","And then from a programmatic standpoint, the IDEXX Preventive Care program, I think really hits a sweet spot in the marketplace we have a care protocols designed specifically for Preventive Care or wellness screening, it\u2019s priced to really drive compliance with the client. We are able to provide tools and training for the practices and repeat follow-ups. So from the standpoint of operationalize, they\u2019re implementing a concept that our customers are quite interested in to begin with, but have struggled in the past to be able to get good traction with this, we think we have really hit the sweet spot and our field is trained and excited by it and consequently driving growth with it.","Ryan Daniels","Okay, super helpful color. And then just as a follow-up on a different topic, the operating margin performance continues to display upward pressure despite investments you\u2019re making. Can you maybe highlight what some of the key deltas are between prior expectations versus kind of the expectations you had going into the year? What are really the major upside drivers there? Thanks.","Brian McKeon","Yes, I think a couple of factors. I think we always benefit from good execution on growing the CAG recurring diagnostic revenue. So I think there the incremental flow through from that growth is high gross margin for us and I think that always if we\u2019re executing well, which we have been, supports good P&L profile. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned in my comments, somewhat slower than anticipated ramp in some of the growth we\u2019re projecting for R&D and sales and marketing, nothing to be concerned about, it\u2019s more just in a world where there is a lot of competition for talent, where we don\u2019t have all the position filled with the way that we had originally projected and we\u2019re confident we can get on that track, but we had some upside related to that.","And we have had good G&A management. We\u2019ve been disciplined in the corporate functions, we had better than expected benefit cost, which is something that we have \u2013 our HR team does a tremendous job of managing that area. And I think we\u2019re seeing good results as a company from that. That\u2019s been favorable. And so those are some of the drivers, I think it\u2019s broadly Ryan, more just reflective of the health of our business model, when we\u2019re growing, the recurring CAG revenues as well that has good favorability for us.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. And I do wish Jon all the best in his recovery as well. We\u2019re all thinking about him here. And thanks for taking my questions as well. I guess a follow-up to the last question there kind of on the profit experience that obviously, was pretty strong and were there any some timing dynamics, where you\u2019re seeing that some of the costs were potentially pushed out to the outer quarters or how should we be contemplating that quarterly cadence in terms of the profit dynamic for the balance of the year?","Brian McKeon","Somewhat, you know, more modest, I would say, in terms of pushing out timing. I think it\u2019s more of the ramp of the cost, Erin, so we\u2019re a little favorable in Q2 and we\u2019re anticipating we\u2019ll be back on track in the back half of the year and that\u2019s reflected. We shared a 50 to 100 basis points constant currency improvement in Q3 so that reflects that we\u2019re seeing the cost growth particularly in R&D and in the international sales and marketing, getting ramping as we work through the year.","So it \u2013 we had \u2013 that I would say is the bigger driver was and we have some specific benefits just in terms of things that we\u2019ve been managing effectively in the quarter, but we feel comfortable with effectively we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve an outlook for the second half that\u2019s more 50 to 100 basis points which is in line with our longer-term trends and goals.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the Preventive Care side, what could add instead of your urine analysis to the program add for you? Is this significant in terms of financial contributions or placement trends or how much of your existing kind of Preventative Care users are actually already incorporating urine analysis in their program? I\u2019m just curious what could this could add? Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","Yes. So we \u2013 thank you, Erin, for the question. We think over time that it will help support our Preventive Care momentum. Over \u2013 there\u2019s a majority of customers who already use urine as part of the testing panel for Preventive Care, and one of their requests from customers as they wanted to pressure because it\u2019s more clinically relevant. So being able to provide at a multimodality screen for customers was extremely well received in the marketplace, we\u2019re enthusiastic about it and we think it also, by the way, help with SediVue placements over time.","Erin Wright","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block","Great, thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe two questions on some similar themes that were already touched upon, but just to go to Preventative Care, I think, Jay, you might\u2019ve mentioned roughly a 300 basis point premium growth rate from those called PCC adopters versus the non-adopters. And maybe if you can elaborate on that a little bit. Do you think we see that delta widen further over time? And maybe if you were to isolate the practices that did adopt PCC, where were they previously? In other words, were they 7% or 8% and jumped to 14% or 15%? Any more granularity would be helpful. Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","Yes. So, just in terms of that, that 300 basis point orbit, we think that those customers are using more diagnostics that they have got from largely testing geriatric patients that testing adults and senior patients and incorporating diagnostics in their panels. I think what the data shows is that they had perhaps assumed that if a dog or cat was well and was an adult, that they didn\u2019t do diagnostic testing, they didn\u2019t need to do it. And what the data is showing is that they\u2019re very significant, we\u2019re able to uncover very significant number of abnormalities that require follow-up in doing testing. So we think that it\u2019s just a classic case of being able to demonstrate that the clinical benefit of doing testing more broadly across the population patients.","In terms of how that plays out differentially, in terms of growth over time, we\u2019ll say, we expect to continue to see benefits, but that\u2019s a function of\u2026","Brian McKeon","And Jon, we\u2019ll share more of that at Investor Day, that\u2019s obviously part of the long-term strategy and we\u2019ll share how we\u2019re thinking about that.","Jon Block","Okay, great. And then sort of a quick follow-up, two small ones. First on new products, you got that Analyst Day coming up, right. As you just mentioned, I hope you\u2019ve got a lot of to discuss. But is the belief that new product introductions are more, call it an industry conference event rather than a Wall Street event and the other small one would just be on the $5 million in organic revs coming down, it certainly seemed like it did not occur in CAG recurring. So if we were to isolate it, Brian, is this sort of 50-50 between, call it LPD and the instrument side? Thanks, guys.","Brian McKeon","Two questions, just on the first one, Analyst Day is we intend to have discussions in new products when we\u2019re ready to bring them to market. So I think we\u2019re \u2013 you should anticipate, we\u2019ll have those discussions close to when we\u2019re ready to bring products to market and we\u2019re not going to be trying to time it around investor events if you will. No offense, but I think we want to have this lined up as best we can in terms of executing with their business.","And in terms of the dynamics versus \u2013 deltas versus our expectation in the quarter, Jon. It was \u2013 that was pretty much it. It was three things; it was \u2013 the international upgrades where we \u2013 we had great competitive placements, but we were probably a little aggressive on trying to do that and build on the upgrades. It was LPD, China, specifically African swine fever effects. And to a degree we\u2019ve underestimated the days impacts in Europe somewhat. We didn\u2019t flag that 0.5% impact heading into the quarter and we knew there were some impact, but that turned out to be just where the days fell a little bit more significant than we anticipated.","But some total that was about $5 million, $6 million delta to where we thought we\u2019d come in and we\u2019re basically just flowing that through. We think it\u2019s a largely second quarter. We\u2019ve calibrated effectively and feel very good about the year. And as you pointed out, the recurring CAG right on track and healthy year-to-date trends right in line with what we hope to achieve for the full year.","Jon Block","Perfect. Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys, thank you. And I also want to send my best regards to Jon in his recovery. I guess my first question is just on the, how you guys are thinking about \u2013 I know you\u2019re not ready to guide for 2020, but you\u2019ve posted some really strong growth in premium instruments as you\u2019ve talked about in recent quarters. And you\u2019re going up against difficult compare, as we think about our models for next year. Recognizing that instruments are only 6% of your revenue, how do you think about growth rates in instruments going forward given difficult comparison?","Brian McKeon","We intend to continue to build on our rate of placements. I think that the more important metrics to kind of focus on, are broader than just placement growth we\u2019re obviously, as we\u2019re growing our placements, expanding our installed base that supported by improving retention. So we pointed out in this quarter, the 15% year-on-year growth in the North American Catalyst installed base, about 5 points to that is the Banfield expansion and 28% international. So we\u2019re -- now this is a business where we\u2019re adding more instruments and doing a better job retaining our customers that installed base continues to grow, it\u2019s the flywheel effect.","And that forms the foundation for additional drivers of growth, right? In terms of expanding the adoption of our innovations on this platform \u2013 on our platforms, adding new innovations as we have done in recent years as well, and that\u2019s all supported by the in-house commercial capabilities that we have the VDC model. And that outflows into the strong double-digit recurring CAG growth delivering and we intend to deliver in the future. So it\u2019s one metric, as you point out, we\u2019re building on bigger numbers we want to keep going on that, but there is a broader model here in terms of driving increased utilization and innovation on these platforms that grow and capability over time that support the double-digit growth.","Jay Mazelsky","Yes, just to add some color to Brian\u2019s remarks. A key element of our strategy, Mark, is to be able to continue to drive menu expansion which in turn supports the CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. So if you take look at Catalyst for example, we have a technology for life type of philosophy, seven new assays as part of the menu in seven years, latest being Progesterone, it\u2019s a great example of bringing Real-Time Care measurement to the clinic. As you know the pregnancy, the contamination of it, there is tight window on the veterinarian wants to be able to advise the breeder in terms of the optimal time, it -- if you are able to do that in a real-time basis with Catalyst in the clinic that drives serial testing.","In the case of SediVue, another great example, with SediVue the neuro network 4.0 which we released earlier in the year based on 175 million images, more geared towards the 4.0 release of liver function, bilirubin and ammonium biurate. So we\u2019ve got excellent customer feedback on that, and we continue to drive do manual expansion more testing utilization. So that\u2019s a key element for our strategy.","Mark Massaro","Excellent. And I also wanted just ask about the end market. Trends look strong to us. You reported clinical visits grew 2.1% this quarter. Do you expect clinical visits to hover in that call it 2% growth rate? And then I also wanted to ask about how you\u2019re thinking about competitive dynamics for the next year given Zoetis expecting to complete their integration of Abaxis on their SAP?","Brian McKeon","Yes. So from a market performance standpoint, top line practice revenue growth was 4.4%. That the clinical piece that you indicated was 2.1%, we think the relevant piece, at least, for our business because that\u2019s where the diagnostic testing occurs as part of those visits. And we\u2019re in pretty much in line with what we have seen in the past is a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter. But we think it was a strong quarter, it supports the CAG Diagnostics recurring growth profile that we achieved in the quarter and that we have indicated from an outlook standpoint, we expect going forward.","And I also think that when you take a look at some of our market development activities like Preventive Care, that will continue to drive the market. Part of what we do is we create markets, we manufacture our own growth. In terms of the your second question on competitive dynamics, we haven\u2019t up to now seen a change, more broadly speaking in the competitive landscape, we\u2019re always looking and anticipating that, but our focus is really on our customers and servicing our customers with solutions that address both the clinical and business needs.","Mark Massaro","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Westerberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","David Westerberg","Thank you for taking the question and best to Jon as well. So can you give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on SDMA slide? Is it running above, below or at expectation in terms of contributing to growth, and how do you see this as a kind of a multiyear growth driver?","Jay Mazelsky","Yes, thank you, David for the question. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on Catalyst SDMA and in fact, close to 60% of customers in the second quarter actually used SDMA on Catalyst, that\u2019s a global number since its introduction are close to 70% of customers have actually purchased SDMA for Catalyst. Another benchmark connected with that is, we\u2019ve now run over 2 million SDMA tests on Catalyst since its introduction. Now that\u2019s on top of 22 million tests plus, 22 million plus test that we run the global reference lab since introducing that test on the reference lab.","So we think from a customer perspective, customers have really accepted SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel. They see significant clinical value, not just for sick patient visits, but also well visit testing. One study I will share more of this at Investor Day is looking at well patient testing when we move from just a basic Preventive Care straight. So chemistry, CBC, the one that includes SDMA, we see a 40% increase in profiles that indicate the need for further action. So we\u2019re really clinically powerful. I think our customers appreciate that and we are seeing the type of uptick in the metrics I shared with you that support it.","David Westerberg","Got it. All right. Thank you. And then \u2013 just maybe to around consolidators and corporate clients, can you just talk about changes and demand around software, middleware or Web links Smart Flow? Are these good conversation starters? Are these revenue drivers? Are they maybe cross-selling opportunities? Can you just walk us through the more the software part element of the corporate customer base?","Jay Mazelsky","Sure. I\u2019d be glad to do. So just as a background, keep in mind that the whole notion of corporate and consolidation, it\u2019s not a new dynamic in the marketplace. IDEXX has had quite a successful track record in partnering and growing with corporate accounts over time. But when you talk to the corporate account CEOs, they generally identify commonly, three top issues. One is staff engagement and retention, the second one that you pointed out is really this notion of enterprise scale in IT and software, the third, they want to continue to drive or improve profitable growth in their corporate practices.","And we address all three as a company. First with diagnostics, because diagnostics is connected to the Information Management piece, and they I think recognize our diagnostic as a profit center, it drives the care envelope, it\u2019s an important part of their practices that is in subject of some of the same headwinds that they may see in product sales whether it\u2019s food or therapies. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence that when we provide these types of solutions to them, their staff will desire to practice best medicine remain more highly engaged.","From an Information Management standpoint, now getting specifically, to the core of your question, our customers, are corporate customers place a very high premium on integration in helping them out with workflow and workflow optimization. And the type of solutions that support that are Cornerstone or PIMS solutions, Smart Flow, Netconnect+, enterprise management and analytics packages that we come up with. The Smart Flow is a great example, where they have a really resonating with an application that works with our PIMS and other third-party PIMS that provides embedded connectivity that helps them with workflow, optimization and communication in the staff. It automatically captures, charges, if they desire to go paperless or paperless light, it has electronic forms. So these are the type of things that they are looking for, and highly responsive to.","David Westerberg","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Andrew Cooper","Thanks for the question. Lots already been asked. So I will keep it quick. Just as we think about kind of IDEXX 360, and more conversations about leveraging the multimodality approach. How has that evolved relative to kind of layering in your end, like you mentioned and some of the numbers competitively? Has there been any change there and how do you continue to drive that as a really competitive advantage for IDEXX relative to what others in the space can\u2019t replicate?","Jay Mazelsky","Yes, so, we obviously, have differentiation because we have multimodality solutions and have the ability, like we\u2019ve have just shown with the IDEXX anywhere urine analysis bundle to be able to provide, the best clinically from a solution standpoint, wherever it makes sense to be tested. So I think it\u2019s largely supportive of helping the practice the way they want to.","Brian McCann","And Andrew, I\u2019d point we\u2019ve seen steadily increasing rates of growth in cross CAG agreements with our customers. And that\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s been ongoing, but really has accelerated with concepts like 360 and the advancements that we continue to make and just bringing together broader capability to our Information Management innovation and so, to your point it\u2019s an area that\u2019s a building momentum and you see that in the strong growth in EVI and in as well as increasing retention rates across modalities. So it\u2019s definitely been core to IDEXX strategy for a long time and we\u2019re executing very well against programs like 360, just help to reinforce that.","Andrew Cooper","Great. And then just one more quick one, I think following up on a question I think Jon asked, but when we think about Preventive Care and the uptake in growth relative to the base, can you help us think about the ramp of how fast from an account says, all right we want to layer it in with the pricing you suggested et cetera, et cetera to seeing that outcome. What the sort of the ramp looks like? And how if there\u2019s any kind of color we should be thinking about or you think about the tail to that as we get out further from the first year to the second year? I know it\u2019s still early but any color there would be great.","Jay Mazelsky","I mean just keep in mind from a background standpoint that it takes time. It\u2019s a change management event in the practice. It\u2019s not just the veterinarians but the veterinarian tax receptionist, all practice has to change focus from into a new testing category or approach. So it takes time. We\u2019ll share some insights at Investor Day in terms of what that looks like but there\u2019s no one rule that fits all.","Brian McKeon","We\u2019ve made very good progress and it\u2019s supporting a high reference lab growth and we\u2019re seeing benefits across the business. So it\u2019s something that I will that will build over time and like many other things that we have in our business, there\u2019s a very long runway for development, which bodes well for sustaining high growth for the long run.","Jay Mazelsky","We have time for one more question.","Operator","That will be a follow-up from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Hi, thanks for squeezing me for the follow-up. I just want to confirm something from the prepared remarks, I thought I heard you say that the third quarter organic guide was 10.5% to 12% for the total company. I recognize you\u2019ve got the extra selling day and that should be a sizeable at 100 to 250 bps tailwind but that still, just trying to look at the comps from prior years. You still have a much tougher comp 3Q versus 4Q. So I was wondering if there was anything other than going on in pacing between third quarter and fourth quarter as you go through the year? And have also how you think about some of the you call it out the guide for the second quarter, all U.S. instrument placements may have been too aggressive, so just want to get a sense of how, the aggressive guidance in 2Q factor into third quarter and beyond?","Brian McKeon","Just on the third quarter, we talked about to restate, 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic and 10.5% to 12% recurring with the day-to-day and a half. I think that the day benefit is a little bit higher on the recurring fees, Mike, so it\u2019s largely reflective of the year to-date trend adjusting for the days and we feel very good about our momentum and our ability to deliver that. So it\u2019s not anything specific to Q3 timing other than the day change.","Michael Ryskin","Okay, got you. I think I heard you wrong on the overall number then.","Brian McKeon","And I would say on the instrument \u2013 look, we\u2019re -- as you know we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019re always trying to build off of a high base and we are executing very well on driving EVI gains and expanding our Catalyst installed base and we think we\u2019ve got our full-year impact of my back half outlook properly calibrated.","Michael Ryskin","Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","Okay, thank you, all, with that we\u2019ll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q2 and the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people of livestock around the world. I\u2019m also \u2013 and also I\u2019m grateful for the confidence that our investors have in IDEXX and our business model. We look forward to being able to share our work with investors and seeing all of you in person or through a Reg FD Presentation at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks. So thank you very much for calling in. Cynthia, that\u2019s it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

I am pleased to take you through our Q3 results and the strong momentum we continue to drive in our business. In terms of highlights from today\u2019s review, we drove 13% reported revenue growth in Q3 with strong global gains across our business lines including 12% normalized organic growth and CAG recurring organic revenues. Instrument placements were outstanding with over 30% year-on-year gains in catalyst and hematology placements in both U.S. and international markets. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.05 per share, up 24% benefiting from high revenue growth, strong profit flow-through and benefits from reduced shares outstanding. In the quarter, we repurchased nearly 2.2 million shares for $272 million bringing year-to-date repurchases to over 3.7 million shares or about 7% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2014.","Our excellent business momentum is positioning us to deliver strong 2014 and 2015 financial performance. Today, we are updating our financial guidance. We are increasing our strong underlying 2014 outlook reflecting organic revenue growth trending at the high-end of our previously raised guidance range as well as benefits from a lower effective tax rate and reduced shares outstanding. We are also updating our preliminary outlook for 2015 top line and EPS guidance with expectations for 13% to 14% organic revenue growth, including incremental revenue from distributor margin capture and strong operating profit and EPS gains. Our outlook for 2014 and 2015 absorbs the headwinds associated with the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we will discuss in more detail.","Let\u2019s go through breakdown of our quarterly performance starting with a brief overview of our regional performance. Our results reflect strong growth across regions in our CAG business as well as continued solid momentum in water revenues and better than expected LPD performance. U.S. revenues were $225 million in Q3 with normalized organic growth of nearly 10%. U.S. gains were driven by 11% normalized gains in CAG diagnostic recurring levels reflecting 14% gains in reference lab and consultant service revenues, 13% gains in instrument consumable revenues and 3% growth in revenues from rapid assay kits. We continue to outpace solid underlying U.S. market growth, analysis of U.S. clinical level data for practices that we track showed patient visits were up 0.8% and practice revenue grew 4.9% in Q3.","Our international growth momentum continues as well. International revenues increased 15% to $158 million in the quarter or 41% of total revenues reflecting nearly 14% organic growth. International CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 15% normalized with strong double digit organic gains in Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America.","Strong momentum in instrument placements in both U.S. and international markets sets the stage for continued high growth in durable CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. Global catalyst placements increased 32% year-on-year in Q3 and hematology placements also increased 32%. Year-to-date we placed over 2,100 catalysts and over 2100 premium hematology analyzers globally representing year-on-year growth of 34% and 22% respectively. While we do expect some moderation in this high growth rate in Q4 as we lap strong prior year placement levels, we are tracking well ahead of our goals for 10% to 15% placement growth this year.","In the U.S. we have placed over 340 catalysts of 30% year-on-year with 60% going to competitive accounts. At the same time we placed 352 hematology analyzers, up 31% year-on-year demonstrating continued high customer interest in benefiting from the integration of IDEXX\u2019s in-house solution. Our placement results also demonstrate clear benefits from our integrated U.S. sales force structure which is being expanded significantly in support of our go direct sales approach.","We look forward to building on this momentum with the first shipment of Catalyst One in November which will expand the accessible market for a highly differentiated catalyst technology. Catalyst now drives over 91% of our instrument consumable revenues in the U.S. with consistent 99% retention rate. The continued expansion of our catalyst base and uplift in testing that occurs when customers switch to catalyst supports our outlook for strong sustained growth in the U.S. recurring CAG revenues.","We also continue to see high demand for our SNAP Pro Mobile Device. We placed 3,200 SNAP Pros in the quarter bringing our install base to 6,100 in just 7 months since our launch in the U.S. Internationally we also achieved impressive results with 35% and 33% gains in catalysts and hematology placements respectively. As a reminder in international markets we are placing only Catalyst Dx currently ahead of future plans for global rollout of Catalyst One in 2015.","Global instrument revenue of $80 million was down about 5% organically in Q3 reflecting $2.5 million of revenue deferrals associated with the Catalyst One introductory offer as well as expansion in international markets where we are placing relatively lower AUP instruments. We continue to expect an instrument revenues growth will lag placement growth this year reflecting high placements of relatively lower priced analyzers such as Catalyst One and mix impacts from expansion in international markets.","CAG recurring diagnostic revenues are revenues associated with instrument consumables and service, rapid assay test kits and lab services were $278 million in the third quarter, representing 72% of overall IDEXX revenues. As noted normalized organic revenue growth was 12% in Q3. Year-to-date gains are now over 11% supported by 10% year-to-date growth in the U.S. and 14% growth in international. An increase in U.S. distributor inventories to 3.6 weeks at the end of Q3 from 2.8 weeks at the end of Q2, combined with a decrease in distributor inventory in the prior year period increased reported growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues by about 2% in the quarter.","The continued rapid expansion of our CAG recurring annuity in the quarter reflects robust global gains across our three modalities. Our Q3 results were supported by very strong growth in reference lab sales. Our reference lab and consulting services revenues grew 14% organically to $126 million in Q3. High growth continued in all regions around the world in part aided by an additional business day in the quarter which added about 1% for lab growth. In the U.S., we achieved volume driven 14% organic revenue gains reflecting the benefit of our integrated sales force model, test innovation and continued adoption and increased utilization of VetConnect PLUS.","Instrument consumable revenues were $91 million with normalized organic growth of 15%. Growth continues to be driven by our steadily expanding installed base of over 14,000 catalysts and nearly 19,000 premium hematology analyzers and increased testing as customers upgrades were premium instruments.","Revenues for rapid assay kits were $47 million in Q3. This reflects normalized organic growth of 5%. We continue to drive solid gains through increased test utilization and very high customer retention, both of which will benefit from our rapidly expanding SNAP Pro installed base. As we look forward to the balance of the year, while we expect continued strong volume growth in rapid assay, rapid assay revenue growth in Q4 will be moderated by a delay in timing from our normal annual price increases as well as timing related to our enhanced SNAP Up The Savings program. Our practice management and digital imaging systems business with revenue of $25 million in Q3 grew organically by 10% supported by continued expansion of our Pet Health Network Pro business.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 18% in Q3, excluding exchange impacts of $30 million reflecting organic growth of 14% and benefits from the acquisition of our Brazil distributor last year. Organic revenue growth was aided in part by accelerated timing of orders in Europe, which will impact Q4 LPD results. Overall, LPD continues to grow ahead of our expectation supported by increased sales in China and high levels of testing in New Zealand related to Livestock exports. We also continue to benefit from a slower than expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western Europe, which will moderate future growth.","Our water business grew 11% in Q3 to $26 million, including benefits from the acquisition of our South African distributor. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 9% supported by solid gains across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, primarily reflecting benefits from new customer acquisitions. High revenue growth in Q3 and strong flow-through drove 17% year-on-year growth in operating profit, excluding transitional impacts associated with implementing the all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and 24% growth in adjusted EPS.","In Q3, we incurred about $500,000 in cost associated with the ramp up of our sales \u2013 in sales and operating resources ahead of the expanded 2015 sales model. We also incurred about $4.3 million in non-recurring project management and other one-time costs required to implement the strategy. The commentary that falls on Q3 profit drivers excludes these transitional impacts. Gross profit was up 15% slightly ahead of revenue growth. We saw benefits from reduced products and service cost reflecting volume leverage and modest increases in selling price. These positive impacts were partially offset by comparisons to higher prior year foreign exchange contract gains.","Operating expenses, excluding transition impacts, grew 13% driven by increases in global commercial spending and support of accelerated revenue growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.05 for the quarter, up 24% year-on-year and $3.04 year-to-date, up 16%. Reported EPS benefited by about $0.04 per share from a non-recurring income tax benefit related to prior years. Including this benefit and transitional impacts associated with implementing the all-direct U.S. sales strategy, reported EPS was $1.03 in Q3 and $3.03 year-to-date.","Free cash flow was $176 million year-to-date or 113% of net income. Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital towards share repurchases. As noted, we repurchased nearly 2.2 million shares for about $272 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 3.7 million shares for $469 million. In the quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet through the addition of $200 million in low fixed rate term date through private placements of 7, 10 and 12-year senior notes with interest rates ranging from 3.3% to 3.8%.","We ended the quarter with $725 million in debt outstanding. We have significant liquidity reflecting $325 million of borrowing capacity available under our recently expanded $700 million revolving credit facility and $293 million in cash balances. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA were 2.0 times gross and 1.2 times net of cash balances at the end of Q3.","That concludes the review of our quarterly performance. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for full year 2014 and 2015. We would like to point that our updated outlook incorporates recent changes in FX rates. In Q3, we saw substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. This has the effect of lowering reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits. Given the substantial change in rates, we estimate that this will have the effect of lowering our 2014 outlook by about $10 million in revenues, $3 million in operating profit, and $0.04 per share compared to rates that were used in developing prior guidance. For 2015, at current rates and given established hedge positions, FX will lower reported revenues by about $20 million, operating profit by $7 million, and EPS by about $0.09 per share incrementally. Despite these headwinds, we are well-positioned to deliver strong financial performance consistent with our business goals.","We will begin with our baseline outlook for 2014 before transitional impacts associated with the U.S. all-direct sales strategy. We are updating our revenue outlook before expected impacts of inventory drawdown in the channel to $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion. This reflects expectations for full year organic growth of about 9.5% at the high end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 9.5%. Our revenue outlook also incorporates the $10 million of negative impact from recent FX changes.","We are raising our adjusted 2014 EPS outlook, while covering the $0.04 negative share impact \u2013 the $0.04 per share negative impact relates to current FX rate changes. Our updated adjusted EPS outlook is now $3.85 to $3.90, which reflects expectations for full year operating margins of about 19.5% consistent with our prior outlook and goals. Net interest expense for 2014 is now expected to be about $14 million reflecting the recent borrowings. We now expect that one-time transitional impacts related to the drawdown of inventories related to the transition to the all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. will result in a slightly lower one-time reduction in revenue and operating profit of approximately $18 million to $23 million and $15 million to $19 million respectively in the fourth quarter. The higher end of the estimated impact range corresponds with the full estimated impact of the inventory drawdown impact. We are also refining our expectation for transition sales and operating ramp up cost to be approximately $6 million this year, reflecting the timing of new hires and continue to expect to incur $10 million to $12 million in total of other one-time cost this year with the balance of the spending expected in Q4.","Incorporating these transitional impacts, we expect reported revenues of $1.482 billion to $1.492 billion and reported EPS of $3.42 to $3.54. Our outlook includes expectations for a tax rate of 29.0% excluding benefits from the non-recurring income tax item noted earlier. The lower tax rate in part reflects benefits from transition costs and drawdown impacts being reported at relatively higher U.S. tax rates. We now expect free cash flow to be about 100% to 110% of reported net income and capital investments to be about $75 million. The higher cash flow outlook as a percent of net income reflects our relatively lower capital spending projections as well as working capital benefits in 2014 from our accelerated transition to the all-direct model.","Our growth momentum and strength in commercial capability is positioning us well for continued strong financial performance in 2015. Our 2015 outlook is for revenue of $1.690 billion to $1.710 billion. This reflects expectations for normalized organic growth of 13% to 14%, including expected distributor margin revenue capture of $50 million to $55 million. This outlook incorporates expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% organic growth before margin capture, including about 50 basis points of year-on-year growth benefit related to the deferred revenue changes associated with the Catalyst One launch.","As noted, FX will be a material headwind in 2015 given significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. At current rates, FX will reduce reported revenue growth rate about 1.5%. We are on track to deliver strong profit performance reflected in projected EPS of $4.38 to $4.48 or growth of 13% to 16% compared to our midpoint 2014 adjusted EPS guidance. Note that, projected EPS absorbs a negative 2% EPS growth impact from FX changes. This outlook reflects expectations for double-digit revenue gains sustained operating margins despite negative FX impacts and $5 million to $8 million of incremental operating profit benefit from the all-direct U.S. sales strategy after funding a substantial expansion of our commercial capability.","Our outlook is supported by benefits from share repurchases, given repurchase activity to-date and expectations for continued future capital allocations towards share repurchases, we expect year-on-year weighted average share count reductions of 7% to 7.5% in 2015. We have increased debt moderately in this context and anticipate additional longer term financing in early 2015, which we project will increase interest costs in 2015 to about $28 million to $30 million. The net effect of these changes will continue to be highly accretive to IDEXX. Our 2015 outlook also reflects an expected effective tax rate of 30.5%.","Please note that our outlook excludes potential impacts from carryover inventory in the distributor channel in 2015. There is a potential for up to $5 million of revenue and $4 million of operating profit or about $0.05 per share EPS impact in early 2015. We aim to minimize the 2015 impact through our efforts in Q4 and we will update our success in this regard and our outlook here following year end.","Thanks and I will now turn the call over Jon for his comments.","Jon Ayers - Chief Executive Officer","Brian thanks. It was a phenomenal quarter with broad based growth in our global revenues. Close to 9% I might mention are recurring revenue business model. The strong growth in recurring revenues delivered strong profit growth. This performance reflects the effective combination of three key elements of company\u2019s strategy. First, a sustained focus on innovation and new product launches; second, our transformations in the commercial model; and third, highly functioning global organization.","Let me provide updates and comments on each of these elements starting with innovation. IDEXX\u2019s long history of building and growing veterinary practice diagnostic utilization through innovative and complementary products and services, this generates long lasting revenue as customers increasingly value the complementary nature of our offering. This makes our offerings increasingly attractive to customers resulting in increasing customer royalty and has a multiplier effect as it grows customers\u2019 use of our entire portfolio. Developing unique tests to better diagnose disease and manage pet health is a core element of our innovation strategy. As an example in the reference lab segment of our diagnostics business we introduced the Whipworm Antigen test in early 2014. This specialized test along with our entire portfolio of unique tests that we have introduced in the reference lab is helping to generate strong volume growth particularly in the U.S. Note that almost all of the 14% U.S. reference lab growth in Q3 is volume and much of that is coming from our existing customer as they increase their adoption of our unique specialized testing solutions.","In addition, we are leader in using information technology to revolutionize veterinary medicine and change the standard of care. Our VetConnect PLUS service is both an example of technology and business model innovation in this area. VetConnect PLUS, a cloud based service which we provide for free for our diagnostic customers delivers actual insights from the diagnostic data generated by both our in clinic diagnostics and reference labs including base line levels, changes and trends in graphical form. This delivers not only more meaningful clinical information but also helpful communication tool to the highly valued by pet owners.","Use and adoption of VetConnect PLUS increased customer loyalty to the entire IDEXX portfolio of diagnostic solution and actually increases pet owner loyalty to the veterinary practice, which in turn helps to sustain their growth and our growth in recurring diagnostic revenue. We are increasing adoption and uses of VetConnect PLUS by expanding geographically and by continuing to add new features. VetConnect PLUS is being offering in 14 countries today and will be 16 by the end of the year. In addition, popular mobile notifications and lab results are now available on both iPhones and the android mobile devices. Globally we have over 16,000 VetConnect PLUS activations of which 12,500 are in the U.S.","We also continued to advance our in-house lab integrated with our diagnostic ecosystem. Earlier this year we launched SNAP Pro our mobile device that automates the running of the test kits and adds the results instantly to VetConnect PLUS in the cloud of all of our rapid assay family. While we knew from early on that SNAP Pro brought intuitive and obvious value to the hospital operations and work flow. We now see that practice staff is keenly bringing the SNAP Pro into the exam room to show the client the result of the SNAP test on the SNAP Pro screen.","The SNAP Pro screen clearly shows any positive results and also all of the negative results from our multi-analyte SNAP test including our flagship canine product SNAP 4Dx which tests for six common mosquito and tick-borne diseases. SNAP Pro provides a powerful way for the practice to show the pet owner the value of running our multi-analyte SNAP test on their bellowed pet. By showing value to the pet owner, we increased practice loyalty, compliance, visits, hospital revenue and IDEXX revenues. We have now placed over 6,700 SNAP Pros year-to-date with customers, including 600 quarter-to-date in Q4. This product has huge continued momentum.","Speaking of the rapid assay business, we have been extraordinarily successful in the last month with our annual SNAP Up The Savings membership program, a marketing program which we have run annually for over a decade and well-known by our customers. We have now over 9,000 practices enrolled in the 2015 program, way ahead of any prior year at this time, which gives certain discounts on purchases of all of our SNAP kits as the program has done in prior years. We expect that by the end of the year 85% of our rapid assay customers will be 2015 SNAP enrollees, SNAP Pro or SNAPshot Dx customers, corporate accounts or some combination of the above. So, in addition to the unique value that our family of SNAP tests brings to the practices, these elements strengthen the customer value and thus retention in this segment of our recurring diagnostic revenue. Of course, we won\u2019t be done placing SNAP Pro in 2014, we project significant further placements in 2015, but no product more clearly defines IDEXX instrument innovation than Catalyst One, our next generation chemistry analyzer that we are launching this quarter.","Catalyst One will prove in time to be the most successful and widely used point-of-care instrument globally. We will begin shipping Catalyst One to our new customers in North America on November 3. Now, that we have completed development and an extensive lab and field testing program. As such, we have begun taking orders for customers\u2019 delivery this quarter, an announcement that has been highly anticipated by our North American sales organization. Catalyst One brings unique value of the catalyst platform to our customers with simplicity and in a very competitive entry cost. The analyzers leaf cost can be fully funded with IDEXX rebates by running as few as one patient profile per day. This addresses the vast majority of the market particularly when measured by recurring consumable revenues. Catalyst One functionality and clinical value is completely unique in relation to competitive offerings.","Let me just briefly mention four of the dimensions of uniqueness. First is test menu. Catalyst has test breadth and complete flexibility. The instrument can run a complete chemistry profile of 22 tests using whole blood in 8 minutes similar to a profile that you would send to the reference lab. The largest panel of competitive offering is only 14 tests, but it can also run 17, 15, 14, 10 or 6 test profiles as well as single individual tests. Customers appreciate this flexibility as some cases require only a single test or two and others a complete Chem 22. Catalyst One is also unique in the ability to run several highly important tests for thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes and therapeutic drug monitoring. Each of these tests can be run either alone or together with a profile. Without Catalyst, customers will have to send the sample to the reference lab at greater cost and longer turnaround time.","Second is speed. Catalyst One is unique in being able to reliably generate chemistry results using whole blood within 8 minutes. With Catalyst One, results can easily be generated during the exam and what we call real-time care. Third is two-way integration. With all major practice management software systems, a huge benefit to staff productivity and engagement, electronic medical records and automatic charge capture as the patient information never needs to put into the analyzer. The auto-charge capture and invoicing feature alone can augment a practices\u2019 EBITDA by 2% or more. This economic value is large in relation to the cost of the analyzer and itself can pay for all of the equipment within months. I would note that this capability does take years to develop, including the requisite collaboration of development by third-party software providers. And fourth is of course, VetConnect PLUS, the cloud-based service provided at no incremental charge with instant results on your smartphone the moment the analyzer is complete. Test menu, speed, elegant integration and VetConnect PLUS, four unique elements of Catalyst all at competitive costs.","However, the chemistry analyzers only part of the in-house lab, which almost always includes an analyzer for hematology. A simple biology review provides useful context here. Blood is made up of plasma and cells. The chemistry analyzer gives critical data on the contents of plasma and our hematology analyzer provides 25 parameters on the cells, red blood cells and white blood cells as well as platelets. Clinically, chemistry and hematology needs to be run together and this is exactly what veterinary practices do. The evidence, over 95% of profiles sent to the reference lab that include chemistry also include hematology and 96% of our Catalyst Dx customers in the U.S. also have one of our two advanced hematology analyzers.","Customers buy chemistry and hematology together with IDEXX VetLab Station, because they work in delivering results on a patient sample. Just as you would want only one app to give you a stock\u2019s price and volume, our veterinary customers want an in-house lab that gives the patient\u2019s chemistry and hematology results in one report or mobile app. Customers also want an in-house lab, where patient information is entered only once for all the analyzers or better yet has real-time two-way integration with the practice management software and that is the role of IDEXX VetLab Station, the information hub for the in-house lab that integrates all the instruments and connects them real-time with customer practice management software. IDEXX is unique in being able to do this and IDEXX VetLab Station also connects to the internet or smart service as well as the VetConnect PLUS instant results. So, while Catalyst One is truly unique, innovative and cost effective in comparison to today\u2019s competitive offering, all these advantages that I just thrive for Catalyst One are also enjoyed by our Catalyst Dx customers today.","As Brian stated, our Catalyst Dx installed base of customers account for 91% of our consumable, chemistry consumable revenues in the U.S. with certain \u2013 when certain corporate accounts, which we had historically served direct or excluded. The unique value that Catalyst brings plus IDEXX hematology to the veterinary practice explains why we have maintained consistent 99% customer retention.","Okay. Moving to the commercial transformation, in the veterinary market a sustained rate of innovation must be matched by strong field sales and support organization that can bring these benefits to the practice and support their adoption and thus growth of the diagnostic category. In the U.S., we have transformed our sales organization in 2013 to an account manager model, where our customers are supported by a single veterinary diagnostic consultant representing all three diagnostic modalities that makeup our recurring diagnostic revenues. Territories have become small enough that our sales professionals can establish regular customer calling cycles. In 2013, we demonstrated a 60% increase in customer visits in this new model, with just a 15% increase in sales staff. With this model gaining maturity in 2014, we have seen consistently strong growth over the course of the year in diagnostic recurring revenue in the U.S. with Q3 coming in at 11% normalized growth.","One of the key reasons for this growth is that as we are regularly calling our customers, we create awareness and education of unique new testing capabilities and workflow innovations that we offer both with our in-house instruments and our reference lab. This is one of the reasons why customers have consistently asked that we visit them more often. The result is that when we visit at subject matter experts, customers grow their use of IDEXX diagnostics faster contributing to the growth of our recurring diagnostic revenue. This is another reason why, for example, we are seeing 14% reference lab and consulting services modality growth in Q3 in the U.S.","And so with this insight, we are embarking on a further expansion of direct sales and support model as we go to our fully direct sales strategy in the U.S. This allows us to shrink territories even further, with each sales professional having smaller, more concentrated geographies and thus able to visit more customers more regularly. In fact, in this new model, a VDC can visit accounts that make up 60% of his or her revenues in a week and 95% in four weeks. We have made exceptional progress in Q3 and moving to our new fully direct sales strategy in the U.S.","Some milestones of note, we have hired 96% of our expanded sales and field support physicians and expect to be virtually complete by November 3, including our 174 veterinary diagnostic consultants, 22 veterinary diagnostic specialists and 23 regional managers. Second, this staffing success also includes an expanded team, 73 field support representatives for diagnostics, which we have now 100% filled. These folks, which are made up of highly experienced veterinary practice professionals, train existing customers on our steady stream of new innovation, such as our in-house lab, advanced menu, and VetConnect PLUS and they are highly appreciated by our customers. Third, we are now live with a fully staffed inside sales center consisting of 75 regionally assigned professionals. This group both receives inbound and makes outbound customer calls, helps customers with orders as product line experts and has tremendous customer reach and frequency. Fourth, we are alive with our nationwide logistics capability now providing free shipping and next day delivery to the entire continental U.S. leveraging our partnership with UPS and FedEx. And fifth, we have introduced several other elements of our direct sales and marketing strategy, such as credits for expired products and special promotions when ordering direct.","Our teams involved in all these elements, the plan have done a truly phenomenal job and we are ahead of an ambitious schedule laid out just a few months ago. We are now in the position to begin to transition our customers to our fully direct sales model through the balance of Q4 and leading into 2015. The growth in our commercial capability extends beyond the U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics part of the business as we are now operating as a highly effective global organization. As Brian enumerated, we have achieved strong growth globally in the companion animal market.","In the quarter, Europe as a whole had 15% organic growth in recurring diagnostic revenue, Asia-Pacific 18% and Latin America 43%, where we benefited from our direct presence in Brazil. This momentum in our global CAG diagnostic recurring revenue is a result of significant country and region leadership additions we have made along with additional field based resources. I was in Europe last week and our international teams are highly engaged doing a great job at accelerating growth of IDEXX and leveraging the unique value of our diagnostic offering.","Also, important to note that this CAG international momentum does not yet even benefit from the launch of Catalyst One slated for Q1 in major European markets. Catalyst One with its low entry cost and unique capability is going to be a significant driver of recurring revenue growth globally for years to come. Practices are generally smaller internationally, so Catalyst One\u2019s lower price point is better suited to these markets than Catalyst Dx. Our international teams can\u2019t wait to get their hands on the new analyzer and its integration with VetConnect PLUS.","Our water business with 43% operating margin year-to-date and is almost 100% recurring revenue from a highly loyal customer base also is effectively in investing commercial resources for accelerated growth achieving 9% organic growth in Q3, building on 7% in Q2 and 2.5% in Q1. It\u2019s really amazing to see what this team is able to do with a little investment and by taking a fresh perspective on driving growth in this highly profitable business.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business is a mix of recurring and multi-year campaign revenue. Both sides of the business did incredibly well achieving 13% organic revenue growth and performance with contributions from all regions in this global business model. Again, this team is really engaged and focused on global growth, particularly the recurring revenue portion of the business. In this call as we traditionally do, we are getting top line and bottom line guidance for the next calendar year 2015 that incorporates 13% to 14% normalized organic growth.","This outlook reflects the continued output of investment R&D and innovation projected at over $100 million in 2014 and growing, a level we believe represents greater than 80% of the identifiable industry\u2019s investment in diagnostics and information technology R&D for companion animal health. Note, much of this R&D is devoted to products, services and software advancements that we have yet to announce, with some exciting additions to our lines slated for 2015 introduction. The 2015 also reflects our investment in the U.S. and global commercial expansion and the full rollout of all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. Note that it also incorporates contingency, appropriate for the risks in our business, including the all-direct sales strategy. Finally, our outlook accounts for promotional strategies to take advantage of our direct approach to drive diagnostic customers, diagnostic volumes in the sustainable, profitable recurring revenue growth and bottom line performance.","So, before I open the call for questions, I just really want to thank the 6,000 IDEXXers who helped make this such an amazing quarter performance, one of the best in my 12 years at IDEXX. And so with these opening remarks, Brian and I are ready to take your questions. Cynthia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, maybe I will start one with you before my follow-up. If I go back and look at kind of July and then your October update and then today, it seems like the impact you are anticipating from the all-direct sales shift has lessened over those periods, both in regards to the sales investment required and some of the revenue and operating profit hit to the inventory drawdown, can you just go into a little bit more detail how you have honed in that range and why it looks to be less than anticipated?","Brian McKeon","Sure, why don\u2019t we breakout into \u2013 Don into two components. One would be the cost estimates that we had. They have \u2013 the major change there was the \u2013 on the we obviously we are making some preliminary estimates back in July and on how this would rollout on the ramp costs so the cost that we \u2013 the ongoing cost that we are putting by the sales resources, operating resources that we expect to continue, we took that estimate down for 2014 from $8 million to $6 million and that\u2019s basically just timing. It\u2019s of when the costs actually flow through. As Jon noted we are fully on track to be fully staffed. And just relative to our earlier estimates which were a big conservative we came in a bit better on that front.","The second change was related to the impact of the distributor drawdown. And we had higher estimates when we first came out with our outlook there we didn\u2019t, we hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to speak to others about how to manage this. And so we estimated that the impact would largely take place in early 2015. We have been very effective at working together to move this forward, so we can have a clean transition on January 1. We did reduce the impact of the revenue and profit in part because the impacts that we estimated in 2015 would have been grossed up for the additional margin capture. So you reduce that by the 15% of margin capture by moving it into 2014 as less of a revenue offset. And just versus our last outlook we have moved it a couple of million more again just based on refinements as we are getting closer to the date. So taking a step back it was more that we had more limited information when we put out the original estimates that were bit conservative and as we were refining this it\u2019s we are able to tighten that range up a bit.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay, that\u2019s perfect, very helpful color. And then as for my follow-up, I guess one for you Jon, you talked a little bit about your rapid assay initiatives both in regards to making that more of an instrument consumable with the strong placements there, but also the SNAP Up The Savings program and your corporate accounts. So can you maybe the one thing I am not as familiar with is the SNAP Up The Savings, does that actually walk consumers in for some kind of minimum purchase or is it just a very high retention vehicle because they incur more savings the more products they use just some more color on that and the retention aspects of it? Thank you.","Jon Ayers","Yes. It gives them a discount when they are enrolled in the program, it gives them discounts upfront and it gives some discounts based on the volume of their purchases in the back too. So it\u2019s \u2013 it doesn\u2019t lock our customers in anything. But it\u2019s a very well appreciated program and it does give some attractive volume discounts as a \u2013 as they use SNAP products over the course of the year.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay. Thanks a lot for the color and congrats on the strong performance.","Jon Ayers","Thank you.","Brian McKeon","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Instrument placements were very strong as were consumables but was there any meaningful promotional activity that was new or just implemented in the latest quarter as opposed to what occurred in the first half of the year that had a significant impact on Catalyst One as well are you seeing the initial traction or feedback that you had hopped to see ahead of that launch, where do orders stand and how big is the market opportunity there?","Jon Ayers","Yes. There was nothing indifferent about Q3 from in terms of the types of programs that we used versus the prior programs. They were all continuing focus on the Catalyst introductory offer and everything was basically a business as usual. This program has been very effective first of the year. With regard to the anticipation of Catalyst One, we only began taking orders this quarter. I do note that we actually entered with a little higher backlog of catalyst coming into the quarter than we normally do. So obviously we are in good shape and it\u2019s not a big backlog business but more units in the backlog is helpful for Q4. But I think Catalyst One really and we had a number of customers who said I love what you are talking about with catalyst but I really want to wait for the analyzer I don\u2019t want to go through the introductory offer and now we can serve those customers and they can take their Catalyst One delivery in Q4 get the tax write-off and start enjoying the benefits of catalyst technology. So we have \u2013 we do have customers who have been waiting for Catalyst One.","And then of course Catalyst One is going to be very effective at both upgrading the remaining vet test customers that we have out there of which we have thousands of course. And also it\u2019s a wonderful tool to upgrade customers who are in decade old technology and want to move to the unique value of IDEXX\u2019s diagnostic solution that have competitive offerings and that\u2019s a very attractive base of customers to go after. I think Brian noted that even in Q3, 60% of our placements work to new and competitive accounts and that just shows that there are a lot of customers who are not using IDEXX today, who want to move to the new capability that we bring.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And on the direct transition, you mentioned previously that 60% of your business are roughly that is direct already, has that moved at all ahead of the full direct initiatives or your full direct effort? Where is the metric now and has it surprised you based on kind of customer responses following recent changes from Patterson and Schein?","Brian McKeon","Yes. That in Q3, our business model was the same as Q2, so the 60% roughly holds. I think we are now of course in the market and we are close to our 365 field and phone-based representatives who are representing for the diagnostic line between veterinary diagnostic consultants and the specialists and our inside folks and our field service folks. And when we have conversations with customers, we are easily able to ease any concerns they have and build enthusiasm as they become aware of the change. So, I think we are well facilitized to do that. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a matter of going out there and talking to customers and I think we are fully staffed in the position to be able to do so and in fact are doing so quite effectively.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block - Stifel","Great, thanks and good morning guys. Maybe the first one, Brian for you and there was a lot of moving parts and a lot of helpful numbers, but just when I look at sort of the 3Q\/4Q cadence and what\u2019s implied for fourth quarter, you beat by roughly something like $0.17, you raised by $0.05 for the year. I know you called out I believe roughly a nickel in FX headwind, but maybe if you can talk to the cadence in the 3Q\/4Q do we just all have it wrong, because of a lot of OpEx coming on from the hiring towards the tail end? That would be on the bottom line. And then on the top line, you steadily increased the organic growth throughout 2014. Fourth quarter is an implied step down, obviously a tougher comp, but maybe if you can talk to that as well? And then I will go ahead with my follow-up. Thanks.","Brian McKeon","Sure. And why don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, Jon, we provide full year guidance, not quarterly guidance, so why don\u2019t we focus on kind of what our outlook was and what our outlook is. We \u2013 as you noted, we had a very good Q3 and that is giving us confidence in taking up our organic revenue growth rate to the high end of the range and from where we were currently and our revenue number is aligned without excluding the FX adjustment. In terms of the fourth quarter, we expect that our growth is going to be in line with our full year outlook adjusting for a couple of factors. We are delaying the rapid assay price increase just to align it with our other \u2013 our practices to Jan 1 and we have this expanded SNAP Up The Savings program. Combined, those are probably going to reduce our organic growth rate by about 1 point in the fourth quarter and we do expect some moderating growth in LPD. It was extremely strong in Q3 as well, but basically, the underlying growth is consistent with our full year outlook adjusting for those factors. And we are expecting the same kind of flow-through, the same kind of flow-through on the operating profit margin. As you noted, we had some FX headwinds and had some things like benefits from the accelerated share repurchases, which help to mitigate that. I think relative to where the Street may have been I do believe our revenue number was a healthy beat to what people were expecting for us then I think that was probably the key driver in the quarter.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay, great. Very helpful. And then Jon for you, you had I guess one competitor report in front of you in a way of three competitors reporting behind you, can you just talk to what you are seeing in the field? I mean, you gave a lot of specifics on catalysts, but I guess where I am going with this is I am anticipating that we are going to hear from others their success in moving share and how they are being impactful out in the field and do you want to speak to vet test retention at all and in other words, do you think if they are citing success, it\u2019s more just a function of them placing the boxes instead of Abaxis or are you seeing any higher levels of churn within vet test even though it is only 9% of consumables ex-corporates? Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Thank you. So, I think that\u2019s a good question, obviously, 91% of our consumable volumes comes from our 9,000 plus catalyst customers, where we have consistently maintained 99% loyalty that really didn\u2019t change in Q3. All those trends hold steady. By the way, the trends with the vet test, which are typically low 90s retention are \u2013 those trends haven\u2019t changed other than maybe 30 basis points impact on the consumable value of the move of one of our corporate accounts to a competitive analyzer, but that was a pretty low volume account. So, clearly, catalyst technology is very unique. A lot of vet test customers that we have been trying to convince to upgrade for a long number of years with our partners that haven\u2019t upgraded typically are smaller accounts obviously. I think we have 6,000 of them. Some of them are \u2013 let me have another analyzer in their practice too. So, that\u2019s why they are lower volumes. Now, we have Catalyst One. And Catalyst One looks and feels like an instrument that is worth upgrading to that. It\u2019s an easier decision both economically in terms of how it looks on footprint than Catalyst Dx is, but clearly, it\u2019s the \u2013 it\u2019s where we see the lower royalty is in the low volume vet test installed base at 9% of our consumable revenue. So, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think you probably understand that\u2019s an important factor.","Jon Block - Stifel","Thanks for your time guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James","Hi, guys. Two quick ones for me. First, on the inventory in the channel in the quarter, it looks like obviously you had a couple of more \u2013 about a full week of more this quarter relative to last quarter and I would have thought that the distributors would want to kind of draw that down in anticipation of the change. So any comments of why you thought the acceleration in 3Q relative to normal trends?","Jon Ayers","No, just 3.5 weeks is totally business as usual. Our inventories in the field for the last as long as I have been at IDEXX 12 years that range between 3 to 4 weeks that\u2019s right smack in the middle, I think the two-way it was just a low number happen to be how the days fell at the end of the quarter. I think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what the distributors typically need in order to fill their warehouses across the country and serve customers.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly on the international growth, another very strong quarter there and I am just trying to get a sense of how you thought about Catalyst One internationally and what that could do from maybe a top line perspective over the coming years as you better penetrate the much bigger international opportunity versus the U.S.? Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Yes. Catalyst One was as much designed for the international market as was the U.S. market, because it\u2019s really got all the functionality Catalyst Dx, but it\u2019s 40% less cost and a smaller footprint actually has incremental functionality, if you consider VetConnect PLUS and the addition of the T4 tests. So, our international teams we are very, very excited about Catalyst One, but they have been gearing up. That\u2019s why we have increased our investments in our international operations and we were now direct in most European countries in South Africa and Brazil and we geared up our capability in some of the Asia-Pacific country and we are going to be launching Catalyst One in virtually every market in 2015 with the exception of Japan, where there is a regulatory approval required. It takes a little longer in Japan, but we have got a great offering in Japan with Catalyst Dx. And the Japanese really appreciate ProCyte as a hematology analyzer.","So, I think we are in a \u2013 just in a phenomenal position to grow the recurring diagnostic revenues internationally for years to come. Obviously, we have got a lot more vet test upgrade and a lot of Greenfield accounts. We have a much more fragmented competitive scenario. It\u2019s kind of country by country and we are growing the lab business. I didn\u2019t mention it, but our lab operations in Europe did very well in the third quarter. The Leipzig lab is really becoming a very effective tool, a twin lab business, because we are able to provide far superior turnaround time next morning which is really unheard of in the markets that we are serving with that lab previous to it\u2019s introduction and that works in conjunction with Catalyst One. These are trying to work together to buildup integrated diagnostic offering much in the same that we have done in the U.S. So we are very, very excited about the global market and it\u2019s not really dependent on economies obviously with 15% organic growth in Q3 in Europe we didn\u2019t get any help from the economy in that regard, but these are attractive markets for us.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James","Thanks for the color. Nice job guys.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will go the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just starting off wanted to ask about the delay in the price increases, Brian I think you made a comment about that, could you give us a little bit more clarity why you decided to lay that price increase and I have got a follow-up on that?","Jon Ayers","Thanks for that question. We actually made that decision about a year ago. Our price increase \u2013 last price increase was September of 2013, but the industry standard is January. And what happens is all the suppliers increase their prices to the veterinary practices in January. And what practices do is they go update all of their systems, one. And so when you have a price increase that is not timed with that, it\u2019s an inconvenience to the customer. So what we decided about a year ago is that we would go 15 months without price increase, so we can move it to January which is an industry norm and also the norm for where we had already moved the vet lab consumables. So we would be consistent with ourselves and with industry norm.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","And that makes sense. Thanks Jon. And then just could you give us a little bit of color as to what type of increases you typically push through and what this move to the direct sales model and maybe more competitive landscape do you think that changes the pricing power in the industry overall?","Jon Ayers","Yes, these are typically a very standard normal price increases of \u2013 in some cases 3% or 4% and in some cases less, but not more and they are just ordinary as we are taking customers through the change through direct model. I think they are totally comfortable. We are able to address any concerns that they might have with regard to pricing. And those are \u2013 we are well facilitized and plan to have those conversations and the conversations that we have been having to-date are universally successful.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe could you provide a little bit of color around strong growth in Europe, it looks like probably your strongest quarter I have ever seen and if you could comment on the trajectory of that growth as we paced out into \u201915 and beyond?","Jon Ayers","Yes. Thank you. It really was a great quarter. I think we have a great management team there. Michael Williams moved over there two years ago with really broad understanding of the diagnostic business. And we actually have very long tenure country managers but I think we added some supporting personnel. We hired \u2013 we actually hired Head of Abbott Diagnostics European business. Who is now running that business and she joined in June and she has been just a phenomenal addition and we have added other capabilities. But I think the other thing is that the products and services have gotten better. We have \u2013 both our hematology and our chemistry offering they know how to sell them. Of course our lab business is really starting to grow nicely across the major countries. We have that 15% growth obviously is a portfolio of countries some of which are growing higher than that. We had obviously higher growth in the Nordics by the way. We already lapped going direct there and which we did at the beginning of 2013. So this is \u2013 that\u2019s positive. But we had in excess of 20% - 15% growth in Germany and Italy and Spain of all places. So it\u2019s a broad based capability people love their pets in Europe and I think we are particularly well positioned both commercially in terms of our product line.","Brian McKeon","And I would just add Mark I think that 15% growth is certainly what we hope we can achieve on a sustainable basis in Europe over time which I think is incredible given the economic backdrop. I would highlight, there were some things in Q3 that benefited us. The prior year was floods in Germany and there were some softer performance that benefited the growth a bit, but it\u2019s\u2026.","Jon Ayers","There are always things like, when does the Easter fall or weather good or weather bad in Europe that can affect it. But as Brain said, that\u2019s a good number to go for going forward.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity","Great. And just as a follow-up, you commented on the reference lab, but I think that probably beats most of street models, so can you comment on first of all you didn\u2019t provide revenue guidance by segments. So, at what level do you think the reference lab can grow and if you can comment on the variability through the quarter that would be helpful?","Jon Ayers","Yes. We don\u2019t run it by segment, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t comment and give guidance. But we are talking about we believe in growing recurring diagnostic revenues. And when we do that, we actually free ourselves to think about all the opportunities that can grow the whole. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t actually give guidance that\u2019s not the way we think about the business anymore it\u2019s an integrated offering. But clearly, lab modality is doing well. I think it\u2019s doing well because of our specialty test portfolio in North America. And combined with the fact that we are calling on our existing customer, this is the change in the business model last year. Prior to last year, we had laboratory diagnostic consultants basically we are only calling on potential customers, not existing customers. Now, we are routinely calling on our existing customers. And when we call on them, they are actually adopting that long list of specialty portfolio that we have launched over several years, but which we didn\u2019t have brought adoption because we just didn\u2019t have that commercial channel. So, that \u2013 and then, we are just, we are investing in labs all around the world and improving the service levels. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the global sales.","Brian McKeon","And Mark, I would point out, we did provide guidance on recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth this year, 9% to 11% and we are trending slightly above the high end of that and that\u2019s giving us the confidence throughout the year to raise our guidance ranges through revenue growth and as well going into 2015, given that\u2019s a very durable revenue stream giving us confidence for the high growth rates we are projecting next year.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity","Great.","Jon Ayers","Lab is a significant contributing factor as you know.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity","Yes. Thanks. Nice quarter.","Jon Ayers","Thank you.","Brian McKeon","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company. Your line is open.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering, how many pent-up Catalyst One placements are to go out in the next week and a half when you start placing those things, are most of those accounts that have committed to it, already having the Catalyst Dx in the practice already or are there some that have committed to that?","Jon Ayers","No, our Catalyst One is not \u2013 all of our placements in Catalyst One in Q4 will be the new customers. They won\u2019t be just to upgrading the introductory offer customers who \u2013 that will happen in 2015. So and just a background here, we went to introductory offer at the beginning of 2014 and said well we\u2019ll sell you Catalyst One, but we will loan you Catalyst Dx until for a year until you get to Catalyst One. So, the year doesn\u2019t start until 2015. So, those Catalyst Ones are to customers who have vet tests or competitive analyzers. And, it\u2019s hard to quantify because we weren\u2019t really taking orders for Catalyst One direct placements until this quarter.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, one other thing is, we are hearing in our survey is that about a quarter of practices are concerned about the volume discounts that they receive from their distributor now that IDEXX has gone direct, is there a plan to address that whether its discounts on consumables or some other promotion or do you just not worry about those people and think they will get over their concern?","Jon Ayers","No, we are not surprised that you are hearing that. We absolutely have a plan and it\u2019s in all regards that you say. And the conversations we had with customers when we take them through it, they are absolutely fine. And so, we just need to take customers through it. We have 365 people who can do that. And we are very confident that we had different creative ways including some standard promotions that we are introducing in our direct model for the business that starts program as well as on the Vet Lab side, which I think will \u2013 which are proving to be quite satisfactory to customers as we have those conversations.","Brian McKeon","And that\u2019s all factored in our financial outlook.","Jon Ayers","All of those our promotions, everything are factored into our financial outlook. As well as contingency, we have recognized that perhaps on the vet test and small base that will have some customers that we don\u2019t reach with Catalyst One and we will make the unfortunate decision to invest in a decade old technology that doesn\u2019t have that capability. And so, we have really \u2013 we have factored all of that into our guidance. We are running a bit over. So, we will take one more and close.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks so much. Apologies if I missed this, but as far as incremental invested capital associated with the direct transition goes, the original guidance was $15 million to $20 million, has that number changed at all? And is it all in 2014 or \u201815? And Jon, you continue to mention innovation on the IT front going into 2015, can you give us a sense of what\u2019s the next step there? Is it focused more broadly on expanding Cornerstone utilization or some other sort of capability, any sort of details there would be great? Thank you.","Brian McKeon","On your first question, it\u2019s the same estimate, Erin and it will be in 2015.","Jon Ayers","Okay. Yes, on the IT innovation, obviously we are continuing to add capability to the ecosystem whether it\u2019s VetConnect PLUS or Pet Health Network Pro, Cornerstone you have mentioned or that\u2019s not our only practice management software, but certainly practice management softwares are core to that ecosystem, plus we have other areas that we are investing in that are all really generated to help grow the practice and increase their relevant pet owners. We find as practices invest and particularly our cloud-based \u2013 newer cloud-based technology such as VetConnect PLUS and Pet Health Network Pro combined with their practice management software in many of the cases it\u2019s IDEXX, but not always. They can grow their practice. They are reaching out to customer before during and after the visit. They are earning into new kinds of business models. And this really is a roadmap I think for the profession, roadmap not only we ourselves, but in conjunction with the American Animal Hospital Association and AVMA, American Veterinary Medical Association really is how practices can effectively operate in the future and have strong growth in the current environment. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jon Ayers - Chief Executive Officer","We just want to thank everybody for being on the call. And again, just a huge note of thanks and gratitude to the IDEXX customers who have really worked hard in many ways, including of course the IDEXX all-direct strategy in the U.S., but around the world to achieve just a phenomenal Q3. I am so proud of everybody and we look forward to updating investors on our results for the full year in January. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional questions. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian McKeon","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2019.","IDEXX achieved continued strong financial performance in Q4. This concluded another year where we again delivered revenue and EPS gains above our long-term financial goals. In terms of highlights we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on track with our expectations, driven by consistent 13% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We achieved full year organic revenue growth of 11.6%, aligned with our long-term financial goals of 10% plus annual gains supported by 13% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets.","Our full year EPS was $4.26, an increase of 36% on a comparable constant currency basis. This performance reflected strong top-line growth, a 130-basis point improvement in operating margins on a constant-currency basis and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. We\u2019re well-positioned to build on these results in 2019.","We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth reflected in our consistent guidance range of $2,385 million, to $2,425 million in annual revenues. We\u2019re raising our EPS guidance to $4.66 to $4.78 or growth of 15% to 18% off our 2018 results on a comparable constant currency basis, aligned with our long-term goals.","This is an increase of $0.04 per share at midpoint reflecting flow-through of $0.06 per share of 2018 profit upsides, supported by operating margin gains at the high-end of our goals and upsized from approximately 50 basis points of favorability in our effective tax rate, which we expect will sustain in 2019. These gains are partially offset by a $0.02 per share reduction in our estimate for share-based compensation tax benefits related to changes in our stock price, which is excluded in our comparable constant currency EPS growth calculation. Our guidance reflects consistent expectations for year-on-year foreign exchange impacts.","We\u2019ll walk you through the details of our 2019 guidance later in my comments. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results by segment and region. Q4 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $479 million up 12% organically reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG diagnostic revenues. Global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including $4.5 million or 1.3% in growth benefit from the new revenue Accounting Standard primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement.","By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13.3% organically, driven by mid-teen growth in consumables and reference lab sales and continued solid growth in rapid as a revenues. U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was primarily volume driven, with overall net price gains of approximately 2%. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostics customer retention metrics sustained at high-levels, reinforcing the durability of a recurring revenue base.","IDEXX\u2019s U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to outpace U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,000 clinics. In Q4 patient visits were up 0.3% and clinic revenues increased 4% per practice compared to the prior-year period, a relatively lower level of overall practice revenue growth compared to recent trends.","This same-store growth data is for veterinary visits of all types and appears to be impacted by moderated growth in non-clinical visits, as we\u2019ve seen growth for clinical visits trending closer to 2%. These solid clinical visit trends are aligned with our continued strong business results. We\u2019re refining our data tracking and analysis of clinical versus non-clinical visit trends and look forward to sharing more of this front on future conference calls.","International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 12.5% organically in Q4 driven by 20%-plus organic growth in international consumable revenues. Mid-single-digit reference lab growth improved relative to our third quarter results, with overall gains constrained by continued softer performance in select markets impacted in part by a commercial focus in 2018 on driving very strong in-clinic revenue gains.","Veterinary Software Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems revenues increased 9% globally in Q4, reflecting 8% organic gains and benefits from our recent acquisition of Smart Flow. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued to strength in our Diagnostic Imaging business, which posted a 20% increase in digital imaging system unit placements for the full year 2018.","For the full year, overall CAG revenues increased 13% organically driven by 13% gains in CAG Diagnostic revenues, strong premium instrument placements and solid growth in our Veterinary Software and Digital Imaging business. Full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth included 1.3% in nonrecurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue Accounting Standard changes. Adjusting for this effect our 2019 goals target continued low-teen organic growth in our CAG business, building on our strong business momentum.","Our Order business revenues grew 8% organically in the fourth quarter to $30 million, driven by strong gains in international markets, which were offset to a degree by the timing of year-end U.S. shipments, which moderated overall Q4 growth. For the full year, Water revenues reached $125 million, up 9% organically with faster operating profit growth, reflecting 45% operating margins. We\u2019re very pleased with our continued momentum in the Water business and our targeting continued to high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2019.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q4 was $34 million, down 5% organically as expected, reflecting comparisons to high-2017 year-end government program and distributor ordering. Quarterly growth was also pressured by end-market impacts related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing, and the continued impact of low milk prices in key markets, which has constrained demand for Dairy testing and growth in bovine pregnancy test sales.","For the full year 2018 our LPD revenue was $131 million, up 1% organically. As our LPD revenues are 90% international, macroeconomic pressures in-markets like China can have a relatively larger impact on the LPD business segment than the company as a whole. Given these factors, our 2019 outlook factors in expectations for relatively flat organic growth in our LPD business.","For the full year 2018, total U.S. revenues reached $1.358 billion, up 13% organically, and international revenues increased 10% organically to $855 million or approximately 39% of IDEXX\u2019s total revenues. Full year revenue gains were driven by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets, solidly within our long-term target growth ranges.","Our strong Q4 and full year results reflect continued benefits from global expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally we placed 3,957 premium analyzers in Q4 an increase of 8% compared to high-2017 Q4 levels bringing full year 2018 premium placements to 13,047, up 14%. We placed 2,042 Catalyst in total in Q4 globally, a 10% year-over-year increase, 1,170 premium hematology instruments up 13% and 745 SediVues in line with very strong prior-year levels.","Our focus on high economic value placements drove a 15% global increase in global Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in Q4, and solid EBI gains in both North America and international. In North America, we placed 421 Catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts or 76% of total North America Catalyst placements. International Catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts increased 29% year-on-year in Q4, to 710 instruments, contributing 48% of total international Catalyst placements.","For the full year, our new and competitive Catalyst placements totaled 3,626 globally, an impressive 20% year-over-year increase. In addition to strong premium instrument results, we placed 2,345 SNAP Pros in Q4 supported by over 2,000 placements in North America, bringing our worldwide installed base to over 25,000. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q4 were 37 million a 3% increase organically, off a strong compare in 2017, with gains moderated in the quarter by instrument program mix impacts. Q4 instrument revenues include a $10.5 million in revenues attributed to the Accounting Standard primarily related to expansion of the IDEXX 360 customer program.","Our strong Q4 instrument placement results capped a year of substantial progress in expanding our premium instrument base. We finished the year with 37,000 Catalysts up 24%, nearly 29,000 premium hematology analyzers up 11% and nearly 6,600 SediVues up 69%, reflecting a record 2,719 SediVue placements in 2018. Combined our premium instrument base increased 21% globally in 2018.","Our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation and our strength in commercial capability continues to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of 157 million grew 19% organically in Q4. Results reflect continued 20%-plus gains in international markets and sustained mid-teen growth in the U.S. High-volume-driven consumable gains were supported by expansion of SediVue paper run and SDMA slide revenues, which again contributed about 4% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.","Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services with revenues of $178 million grew 11% organically in fourth quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains strong reflecting a mid-teen volume-driven organic revenue gains. Global lab revenue growth was moderated by mid-single-digit gains in international markets, which while up from Q3, were impacted by continued soft growth trends in select markets. We\u2019re forecasting continued moderate lab growth in our international reference Lab business in the near-term, as we enhance our commercial focus to build on the very strong progress we\u2019ve driven in developing our IDEXX VetLab business in international markets.","Rapid Assay revenues of 48 million grew 5% organically in Q4 reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid Assay gains were primarily volume-driven supported by continued growth of 40x plus, Specialty and first generation products.","Turning to the P&L. Gross profit was $300 million in Q4 up 10% on a reported basis. Adjusting for foreign exchange impacts gross margins increased about 70 basis points supported by continued solid net price gains and strong growth in Consumable revenues. Foreign exchange hedge gains which benefit gross profits were $1 million in Q4. Operating profit in Q4 was $115 million up 18% as-reported, or 20% on a constant currency basis.","Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains and operating expense leverage supporting a 170 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 6% as-reported or 7% on a constant currency basis driven by growth investments in Sales and Market and supporting G&A resources in our CAG business with overall OpEx growth mitigated by disciplined cost control and LPD.","For the full year, operating profit was $491 million. This reflects an operating margin of 22.2% for the full year, an increase of 130 basis points on a constant-currency basis. This outstanding result reflects approximately 30 basis points of constant-currency gross margin gains or about 50 basis points of improvement adjusted for impacts related to cost reclassifications in our lab business.","Our strong full year operating margin results also reflect significant operating expense leverage benefiting from our accelerated revenue growth while we expanded our sales and marketing capability globally and increased investment in products and software R&D, which reached $118 million in 2018 or nearly $130 million on a cash basis.","EPS in Q4 was $0.98 per share, including $0.01 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity and $0.02 in negative impacts related to year-over-year FX changes. On a comparable constant-currency basis, EPS increased 40% including net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.","For 2018, EPS was $4.26, including $21 million or $0.24 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year, foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.01 per share net of FX hedge loss impacts of $1 million. Adjusting for these factors and prior year discrete tax impacts, 2018 EPS growth was 36% on a comparable constant-currency basis.","Our effective tax rate for 2018 was 17.6%, including approximately 5% of rate benefit related to share-based compensation activity. This tax rate was approximately $0.03 per share favorable to our earlier guidance estimates, including about $0.02 of additional benefit related to share-based compensation activity.","Free cash flow was $284 million for 2018 or about 75% of net income. Our free cash flow was net of $116 million of capital investment, including $42 million of combined investment related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and German core lab relocation.","We also supported $60 million in instrument program investments for the year, an increase of $44 million year-on-year, associated with the very successful IDEXX 360 program in the U.S. in support of strong premium instrument placement growth internationally. We allocated $369 million in capital towards share repurchases for the full year 2018, including repurchases of 489,000 shares in Q4 for $103 million.","Our balance sheet is in an excellent position. We ended the year with $1.006 billion in debt, $124 million in cash and $450 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.67 times gross and 1.46 times net of cash. Our strong performance and disciplined capital allocation supported achievement of a 49% after-tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments for 2018.","We\u2019re well-positioned to build on this strong performance in 2019 with the financial outlook aligned with our long-term goals. We\u2019re maintaining consistent 2019 guidance for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth and revenue of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion. This outlook equates to reported revenue growth of 8% to 9.5% net of a consistent projected 1.5% FX growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release.","We finalized the components of our revenue guidance as part of our year-end planning and refined our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook to 11% to 12%, building on our exceptional 13.2% organic growth in 2018, which included 1.3% of nonrecurring growth rate benefit related to the implementation of the new revenue standard.","We\u2019re raising our 2019 EPS outlook to $4.66 to $4.78, an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint, reflecting approximately $0.06 per share in flow-through of 2018 profit upsides offset by a $0.02 per share reduction in estimated tax benefits from share-based compensation activity. This outlook factors in an estimated $0.03 negative year-on-year impact from FX net of $10 million in projected hedge gains, consistent with our preliminary guidance estimates.","As a sensitivity, a 1% change in the dollar from rates assumed in our press release would impact 2019 revenues by approximately $8 million and operating profit by approximately $2 million, net of hedge positions currently in place.","We\u2019ve refined elements of our P&L outlook as we finalized our 2019 plans while maintaining a consistent comparable EPS growth outlook of 15% to 18%. We\u2019re now targeting 50 to 80 basis points of constant currency operating margin improvement, a slight reduction to the high end of our targeted improvement range, with targeted year-on-year gains driven primarily by gross margin improvement.","This refinement is offset by favorable updates to our projections for interest expense and year-on-year share count reduction. We\u2019re now projecting $37 million to $38 million in net interest costs in 2019 and a 1% to 1.5% reduction in average shares outstanding, with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leverage levels at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA.","Our outlook for effective tax rate in 2019 remains at 20% to 21%, as sustained 2018 upsides are offset by updated estimates for tax rate benefits of stock-based compensation, reflecting more recent shape price levels. We now project $6.5 million to $8.5 million or approximately 2% in tax benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation in 2019, approximately $0.02 per share below prior estimates and $0.15 per share below high-2018 levels.","In terms of free cash flow, we expect to continue to invest in high-return instrument growth programs globally and to deploy $160 million to $175 million in capital spending, including approximately $70 million related to completion of our Westbrook headquarter and German core lab projects. For 2019, this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income or approximately 80% of net income normalized for these two major projects.","In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2019, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 6% to 7.5% range, reflecting organic gains of 9% to 10.5%, net of a projected 1% equivalent days\u2019 headwind. Q1 operating margins are expected to be at the lower-end of our full year improvement goals of 50 to 80 basis points as we continue to advance implementation of our international commercial resource expansion. We expect our effective tax rate in Q1 to be 18.5% to 19%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity.","That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan Ayers","Okay. Brian, thank you. A little color commentary and then we\u2019ll open it up to questions. We finished 2018 with strong revenue growth and impressive bottom-line results, even as we\u2019re making significant incremental investments in the business to support our customers, and that will generate sustained growth for years to come.","Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue, which constitutes 75% of IDEXX\u2019s overall revenues in 2018 grew organically 13% for the quarter and the full year, consistent with our expectations. U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue, which represents almost two-thirds of the total global generated organic growth of 13.3%, while international generated 12.5%. International growth was supported by 20%-plus instrument consumable organic revenue growth. Clearly, pet owners have an increasing appreciation of the importance of health care for their pets.","Our growth trends as 2018 wraps up are also a testament to the value our customers see in IDEXX\u2019s unique diagnostic offering and the importance the IDEXX technologies play in health care. The market for veterinary and \u2013 medical and technician talent is really competitive right now, as you can see from this morning\u2019s job report. In fact, it\u2019s been reported that there\u2019s one veterinarian available for every five veterinary job openings.","And so practice owners need to attract and retain valued staff by providing an essential tools and a partner to support their job well and take the best care of patients; thus the importance of IDEXX\u2019s far more advanced innovations. And so our customer retention metrics, which are the foundation of growth in a recurring revenue model continue at exceptionally high-levels in Q4, if not inching up ever so slightly.","Our organic growth remains primarily volume driven, augmented by continued modest price realization. The latter reflecting benefits of how our offerings advance with the benefit of almost $130 million of cash R&D and diagnostics and software in 2018 and a projected almost $150 million in cash R&D in the same in 2019.","This technology for life approach includes the behind-the-scenes software upgrades that happen regularly for our point-of-care instruments like the recently-announced Neural Network 4.0 for SediVue advancing menu. And the progesterone test for our Catalyst platform, our seventh new test in seven years on the Catalyst platform, as well as regular advances in VetConnest PLUS our cloud-based diagnostic software.","For 2018 placements of Catalyst in new and competitive accounts were up 20%. New and competitive Catalyst placements over the course of the year were an important contributor to the 19% organic growth and IDEXX VetLab instrument consumables in Q4. We\u2019re praised with the instrument placement results that Q4 contributed to the year that Brian has enumerated as well as the completion of the rollout of Catalyst one analyzers at over 1,000 Banfield hospitals.","We\u2019re entering 2019 having completed important commercial expansions around the world. The U.S. expansion with the greater customer coverage from a deeper field base, professional organization was in place for the start of Q4. There\u2019s always some settling in during the first quarter of an expansion, as our professionals, including newly-recruited professionals, develop relationships with their customers in their new or reconfigured territories. Especially in this light, the North American growth metrics also against the strong compare were very strong.","As we enter 2019, we\u2019re beyond this initial settling in-period in our U.S. market, our largest, with an experienced world-class team of professionals and frontline leadership. This team is focused on growing diagnostic in the Software category, advancing customers adoptions of new protocols such as preventive care diagnostics, fecal antigen testing, urine analysis using SediVue and growing the overall number of customers that benefit from IDEXX\u2019s unique technologies.","Our U.S. field footprint is in place \u2013 with our U.S. field footprint in place a quarter ago, our 2019 U.S. focus is on the productivity that comes from rep development and time and territory. Our commercial investments in the U.S. in 2019 will focus on high ROI opportunities beyond the field footprint. Our international teams\u2019 expansion plans were timed generally about a quarter later than the U.S. At this point, we\u2019re largely complete in hiring expanded commercial resources to advance instrument placements and a Companion Animal Group diagnostic recurring revenue growth in accordance with our plans.","Our international teams are building competencies with our key commercial strategies. For example, the economic value index of an instrument placement to prioritize high-value chemistry placements which is one of the reasons why we saw a 29% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements in Q4 internationally to a record over 700 units which was up 100 units from Q3 of 2018, which itself was a quarterly record.","Another strategic competency being adopted by international is leveraging the IDEXX 360 program to accelerate instrument placements and drive recurring revenue growth. This type of program is generally new to our IDEXX teams outside of North America and I\u2019m pleased with the team\u2019s progress here as the year wrapped up.","Our international teams are poised to have a great 2019, spreading the benefits of IDEXX\u2019s innovation such as IDEXX SDMA, including on Catalyst. Catalyst placements and our best-in-class hematologist offerings as the expansions is complete, they are settling period in the first quarter 2019. These international Commercial expansions along with a unique diagnostic and software technology offering gives us confidence in our revenue growth targets primarily driven by volume testing gains with secondary support from modest price realization and net new customer additions.","While current economic times bring us steady than a broader macro noise, IDEXX\u2019s growth remains solid reflecting the durable recurring nature of our revenues, the benefit of our differentiation enabled by our industry-leading investments in the innovation and supported by the growing bond between pets and their owners. In sum, we are sustaining solid growth momentum as we enter 2019 which gives us confidence for the 11% to 12% projected organic growth of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in 2019 similar to the 2018 growth trends on an adjusted basis.","Before I open the call to questions, I want to express my deep gratitude to our employees for their accomplishments in 2018 and the pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and Livestock and also my gratitude to the continued confidence the customers have in IDEXX as a value-added technology partner. ","So with those comments, Cynthia, we\u2019ll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Daniels","Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Two somewhat disparate ones. First off, Jon for you, as we think about the expanded international sales force and your potential rollout of IDEXX 360 and kind of integrating the reference and point-of-care more actively, is there an opportunity to push the preventive care protocols and challenge in those markets as well? Or is it still a bit too early in those markets to think that could be a organic growth driver?","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, thank you for that. We\u2019re actually beginning to look at that in some of the more advanced international markets. I think it\u2019s an opportunity we have. And in addition, when we talk about the benefits of diagnostics in a preventive care scenario, it reinforces the importance of running diagnostics when it is not a wellness presentation. And so I think we\u2019ll see it early days in international in 2019, very early days, kind of where we were at the U.S. several years ago. But preventive care really has come of age in 2018 and it\u2019s a big component of our growth in 2019 in the U.S. and now more and more the Canadian market.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. And then if we look at the U.S. market, I thought it was somewhat noteworthy in the press release you called out Millennials and that being a focus for the organization. Can you speak to that note in a little bit more detail as it relates to, you know, how like it serves as a tailwind for the industry and then anything you\u2019ll do specifically given the large size of that Millennial market and their proclivity to spend more on vet care? Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, so Millennials, which we generally define as the 15-year span from 37 to 22, are now in their, you know, taking care of their own pets. They\u2019re also an important and growing part of the professional community of veterinarians and technicians, and all the evidence that we see is that the Millennials visit the vet more. They\u2019re more in tune with their pets.","And I think that one metric kind of calls it out that while maybe 20% of prior generations feel their pets have special health needs, 46% of Millennials think their pets have special health needs, which really I think is an indication of how Millennials are in touch with their pets. And so we see this as \u2013 and then the early evidence is even the generation beyond that, maybe taking it even a bit further, but this is obviously the largest component of the consumer category right now and I think will be a key long-term driver for the growing importance of pet health care.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. Looking at the patient visit growth metrics that you gave, you gave some new color on the clinical visits which were up 2%. How has that metric trended over the past few years, and how would you characterize kind of underlying demand trends across the U.S. companion animal market? I assume that is a U.S. metric you\u2019re giving there.","And what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying demand trends for the year? Can you speak to some of the more resilient aspects to your business that can withstand the sort of fluctuations in underlying demand trends? Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, I want to start with the last part. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re growing the utilization and importance of diagnostic in all kinds of presentations. I think people are realizing that just by doing a physical exam and a history, you\u2019re missing a lot of pieces to the equation without running diagnostics, and of course you\u2019re missing other pieces of the equation if you\u2019re not running IDEXX diagnostics.","So even though we\u2019ve seen some slight \u2013 some moderation in the pet visits over the course of the second half of 2018 in the U.S. market, which is really the only market that we have industry data, and as you note, I think the clinical visits are moderating less. But still, we\u2019ve got 2% growth in clinical visits, so. Which is of course the only type of visit that is important to IDEXX. The nonclinical visit is not really a factor for IDEXX. We\u2019re seeing good demand growth. And so our expectation in 2019 is consistent with really what we saw in 2018.","Brian McKeon","Second half of 2018.","Jonathan Ayers","I think we\u2019re factoring in the recent trends, and our outlook is very much in line with the adjusted growth that we\u2019re driving coming out of the back half.","Brian McKeon","Let\u2019s also recognize, you know, we\u2019re seeing growth in the instrument consumables associated with our new tests, Catalyst SDMA on slide and the growing installed base of SediVue and the growing use of preventive care. So we have a number of growth drivers that make up the total Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue projected growth for 2019 of 11% to 12% on an organic basis.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. Thanks. And on the international side \u2013 I\u2019m going to ask another question on international reference lab \u2013 but when will the sales force more meaningfully kind of mature there? And how quickly is that relative to what you typically see kind of in the U.S.? And then how should we think about that quarterly cadence in international reference lab? When do you really expect that to start to improve over the course of the year? Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","I like to look at the results as a whole, and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve prioritized the Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts, which is a little bit harder sale than a Catalyst placement to an existing IDEXX chemistry customer using VetTest. And while we\u2019ve largely upgraded the VetTest volume in the international market, there are some -- I think it\u2019s 10% of our chemistry consumable volume in the international market because with VetTest remaining to go. This is \u2013 the 29% year-over-year growth I think is really showing that the international is prioritizing the highest ROI work. And let\u2019s recognize, once we place a Catalyst, the loyalty internationally on Catalyst is virtually 100%. ","So these are going to be customers that are going to be using Catalyst for life, and this is very enduring recurring revenue let alone any growth we get in utilization from menu or utilization or adoption of additional protocols. We did see a nice \u2013 we saw a couple percent tick up in the international reference lab organic growth in Q4 over Q3 which really, I think, validates a part of what we saw in Q3 with weather. And part of it was some selective slowdown in markets as we prioritized those chemistry placements.","To get to really where will the IDEXX 360 program and our overall focus on both Catalyst and reference lab, I would say that\u2019s probably going to \u2013 we\u2019ll probably see that in the second half of 2019 start to kick in. But the productivity of the sales force is already pretty high on the important instrument placement side of the equation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig deeper on a couple of the moving pieces and the updated 2019 guide, just to get some clarity. So I think you mentioned the CAG recurring revenues outlook you refined to 11% to 12% versus the 11.5% to 12.5%. It sounds like the accounting standard is now a little bit more; it\u2019s \u2013 I think you said 1.3 and previously is 1.0.","So this is a bit of a two-parter question but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the entire reason for the shift and it\u2019s just a bit of a rounding decision. And then the second part of the question is if that\u2019s now 11% to 12% but the full \u2013 the total company guide is reiterated 9.5% to 11%. is there an offset somewhere else? It looks like LPD is still going to be challenged because of African swine fever. Is this something better in Water quality or is this just a rounding between the various buckets?","Brian McKeon","Yeah, Mike. It really is kind of the rounding effects as we\u2019re just finalizing our plans would be \u2013 we try to provide input for each of the segments in the call, so we said low-teens CAG, high-single-digit Water and relatively flat LPD, and it really is a refinement finalizing our plan. It\u2019s not related to the accounting adjustment, and that kind of implies high-single-digit growth in areas like VSS and digital, and our instrument placement revenues, so it\u2019s just wrapping up our plans very much in-line with our trends coming out of the end of the year, if you look at the CAG recurring growth adjusted for that 1.3% effect, it\u2019s very consistent with that.","We provided the extra decimal point. It\u2019s been slightly above 1% through the year. We\u2019ve just been rounding and we wanted you to have that exact number as we finished the year, but again that is a nonrecurring growth rate benefit. We should be through the accounting change adjustments and kind of fully normalized heading into 2019.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, Mike, I think supportive of Brian\u2019s comments and your comments, I think you\u2019ve characterized it right. We\u2019re pretty unique in providing revenue and profit guidance in October of the year before for the following year which really shows the enduring and predictable nature of it, and really just as we finalize our plans and outlook, we\u2019re talking about some rounding considerations.","Brian McKeon","And I would say we had an outlook in Q4 for the international labs of mid-to-high single-digit. We\u2019re a bit at the lower-end. We did see improvement, and some of that\u2019s factored in as well so we think that we\u2019ve got that well calibrated.","Michael Ryskin","Okay. And then just if I could squeeze in one other quick one on the vet volume data you provided for 4Q, the .3% increase. I\u2019m just wondering if you saw anything weird in the U.S. in terms of whether in the quarter \u2013 we had the California wildfires in October, or if you think there\u2019s any potential impact there from some of the macroeconomic data, the GDP data that came out late in the year, the stock market had a negative move throughout the year, so I was wondering if you thought there was anything there that led to that decrease in vet clinic visits?","Brian McKeon","It\u2019s a lot of moving parts. I would say, and then you have to throw in the calendarization, of December too, which with the holidays and where they fell. I think the .3% that\u2019s total visits we\u2019re getting a better understanding. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to talk in detail about it yet but we\u2019re getting a better understanding of what portion of those visits are clinical visits and what the clinical visit trends are. Are preliminary analysis is clinical visits are closer to 2% of growth in Q4 and so some of that deceleration maybe really just revenue going from out of the practice management system into other channels.","Some channels are channels that benefit the veterinarian through like the direct sales from the veterinarian, but doesn\u2019t go through the practice management software which is of course what we\u2019re measuring. So but I think the overall trends, and certainly our companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13.3% in the U.S. speaks for the fact solid state of the growth in our portion of the industry.","Michael Ryskin","All right. Much appreciated. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of John Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Block","Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. I\u2019ll ask also probably a couple of guidance-related questions. So Brian the first one I think if I heard you correctly the midpoint of the 1Q organic was about 9.75 with a 1% days headwind, that\u2019s largely in-line with the 9.5 to 11 organic for the year. So I guess where I\u2019m going with this is there anything to call out from a cadence perspective for the year on a top-line? Should we think stable and then maybe the Op margin expansion is a bit back-end weighted? Any color would be helpful.","Brian McKeon","I think that\u2019s a fair call, John. I think we\u2019re not, I don\u2019t think we have any meaningful targeted calendarization differences or things to note. You always have segment by segment, specific compares but as we work through the year, but I think that\u2019s fair. And yes, on the operating margin, the full years 50 to 80 and we\u2019re likely at the lower-end of that coming out of the blocks, and some of that\u2019s just the lapping of the investments that we made on the commercial expansion.","We\u2019re still advancing some of the international aspects of that, and as Jon, noted we\u2019ve got plans to increase our R&D spending this year as well, so that\u2019s all factored in, but we\u2019ll expect to build on that through the year. And I did note that we are targeting primarily improvement from gross margins this year, so that we expect that will be consistent too.","John Block","Okay. Very helpful. And that\u2019s probably a good segue into the second question which is, Brian, I haven\u2019t pushed you on margin expansion for some time so maybe I\u2019ll go back for my second question. In 2017 and 2018 the Op margin expansion I believe was around 120 bps to 130 bps, guidance this year like you said is 50 to 80 bps.","Obviously to be fair the baseline is higher now, but you have lapped a lot of investments notably in the sales force that you\u2019ve made over the past 12 months to 24 months and maybe at a high-level you can just speak to the incremental investments and why the amount of op margin expansion in 2019 would be more muted versus the past 12 months to 24 months? Thanks, guys.","Brian McKeon","Yeah, it really is an operating expense story. We\u2019ve been highlighting the additional commercial expansions which will be, as I noted, lapping heading into this year. And the cash R&D metrics that Jon highlighted would imply closer to 15% growth in R&D this year. So we\u2019ve had very high return on our ongoing investment in the organic growth of the business, as highlighted by our 49% after-tax return on invested capital and\u2026","Jonathan Ayers","And then investable business.","Brian McKeon","We are very pleased with the growth and want to keep investing towards that. And look, if we deliver at the higher end of our revenue goals which we\u2019ve had the last couple years, that can have some favorable flow-through benefits. But we\u2019re very comfortable with the outlook that we\u2019re providing at this point.","Jon Block","Okay. And maybe one quick one, if I can. The quality of the beat was really high in the quarter. Notably, the R&D expense came in ahead of what we were looking for. You talked about, per your comments, Brian, solid R&D expectations for 2019. So Jon, maybe can you talk about the turnaround time, if that\u2019s a good term to use, for some of those projects? Would we expect that pipeline to materialize at all in 2019, or is that something more of a 2020 event? Thanks for your time, guys.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, I\u2019m not going to talk about anything specific in the R&D pipeline that we haven\u2019t already talked about, but I do want to reinforce that some of our R&D, a significant portion of our R&D is about our products\u2019 expanding menu, advancing their capabilities. Not only do we have cloud-based software that\u2019s continually advancing, whether it\u2019s in our veterinary software and services, our digital imaging, or of course VetConnect PLUS, and R&D investments are going to that.","So it\u2019s no big product launch, but it\u2019s a continual advancement in the capability that we\u2019re giving the customers, which of course supports recurring revenue growth. Our instruments are almost \u2013 you could consider them as, you know, cloud-based software. They\u2019re continually advancing behind the scenes for our customers, and this is the new model.","Anyone who\u2019s got something powered by software better be continually advancing it through the cloud. I know that\u2019s what Tesla is doing on automobiles and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for quite some time with now seven new menu items on Catalyst in seven years and the advancement in our hematology offering that we talked about over time with four new parameters on ProCyte and the advancements of the Neural Network, the incremental capability we have in IDEXX VetLab Station. So there\u2019s a steady diet of things that don\u2019t necessarily get a lot of individual play, but they have a very meaningful impact on the sustainability of our growth.","And we have very a good pipeline across the diagnostic and software categories. Our R&D group is very \u2013 it\u2019s amazingly productive, combined with our knowledge of the business and our customer requirements and our ability to leverage and access and input third-party technology into our offering. So it\u2019s a continued part, as I\u2019ve said, with close to $150 million of cash R&D in diagnostics and software investment in 2019, we see this as a core part of IDEXX being the sole innovator in the industry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you.","Mark Massaro","My first question is on the mix between U.S. and OUS. So historically, your international growth has trended higher than your U.S. growth, largely given a lower base of business in international but also based on stronger trends OUS. When we think about Q4, in your prepared remarks, you talked about soft growth in select markets OUS, so can you just give us a sense of where those markets are and what your expectations are for OUS in 2019?","Brian McKeon","Yeah, so, Mark, that was specifically a reference to international reference labs. So we had consumable growth in international. The 20% growth overall was strong across all of our markets. It was really exceptional performance. If you look at the instrument placement growth and the resulting\u2026","Brian McKeon","20%-plus. We're very pleased with that progress this year. That was the key driver of the recurring revenue gains. As we\u2019ve been highlighting the mid-single-digit growth in reference labs, what we saw in Q4 was a recovery from the summer in some of our key markets and we don\u2019t like to highlight specific markets for competitive reasons, but we saw a recovery from some of the weather impacts that we had highlighted. ","And we do continue to have relatively lower growth in some markets, and we think this is largely related to the fact that we really shifted the commercial focus on driving the high in-clinic gains this year and weren\u2019t as focused, not by intent, but just outcome on the reference lab business. We\u2019re working to get that back on track, and we expect it will be successful with that, and but it will take an annuity business, the growth rate is really a reflection of what\u2019s happened the last four quarters. So we\u2019ll hopefully be highlighting progress on that front.","Jonathan Ayers","I do want to take the opportunity to \u2013 big shout-out to our German lab and our German commercial organization lab, of course, more than just Germany, but they really had a great Q4 across the board. That\u2019s a team we move to the veterinary diagnostic consulting model we have in the U.S. at the beginning of the year, and they\u2019ve really executed well. Of course, that is the largest lab, where we\u2019re building the new corn Westheim facility which you noted in the capital expansion. So I think we\u2019re putting the money where the performance, is and so that\u2019s the one market I\u2019d really give kudos to.","Mark Massaro","Great. And then as we think about your new point-of-care progesterone test launching in the coming weeks ahead, I know you haven\u2019t raised your 2019 guidance. But can you give us a sense for the size of the market; how you intend to price, it whether it\u2019s a premium to other innovations, such as like SDMA in the slide, for instance? And what type of market potential you think there is for progesterone.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, the list price of that test per test will be $34.99 in the U.S. market; obviously international markets, it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s going to be market-specific, so that is a very attractive list price, and. But it\u2019s really very small, direct contributor. I think what it is, is two things that are relevant to investors. One is this continues to advance both the loyalty of Catalyst customers and it gives us the opportunity to place a Catalysts that have a requirement to serve responsible breeders.","And second, it\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re not done adding menu to our in-house instruments. And this is one of the things about our instrument platform; it\u2019s very flexible to menu addition because each life can be developed individually, and we have the capability to do that. Really puts us in a unique position in chemistry as well as hematology and urinalysis to continue to advance the installed base capability in what we call technology for life.","Mark Massaro","Excellent. And then if I can, are you seeing competitive dynamic changes as a result of some of the consolidation in the space and Zoetis acquiring Abaxis? Just as we think about Abaxis becoming more meaningful in Europe and outside the U.S. do you see any changes to your strategy OUS this year?","Jonathan Ayers","It\u2019s always been a competitive market. I would say with regard to major markets, the U.S. is the most competitive market. And as you can see is our \u2013 our loyalty, even with VetTest customers outside the U.S. is in the high-90s, so it\u2019s always been a competitive market. We don\u2019t really see any changes that have come to play that have been a consequence of the change in ownership of Abaxis.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Thanks, guys. Just had a couple quick follow ups I wanted to throw in there. You mentioned the minus one selling day in the first quarter. Just for our modeling purposes, could you give us the days\u2019 impact throughout the rest of the year, and just to confirm there was no impact in 4Q of 2018?","Jonathan Ayers","So 2019, we have a favorable day benefit in Q3, so and I think the other quarters are not material enough to highlight. Q4 we had a favorable day benefit, but we believe it was offset by the timing at the year-end of the Christmas and New Year's holiday, which really impacted kind of year-end, both Clinic activity but also our shipments, and so we didn\u2019t call that out as a factor because we really think it was weird offsetting effects there, so that was not an adjustment to our Q4 results.","Michael Ryskin","Okay. I appreciate that, and then just the follow-up on one of the other questions I asked earlier about the international reference lab. Sounds like you had the improvement from the low single-digit to mid-single-digits in the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering you called out the relative focus of the sales force driving Point-of-Care versus Reference Lab. As we think through to 2019, how quickly should that move up? Is this something that is reasonable to think can take another step higher in 1Q? Or is this a little more gradual to get the international back to the more high-single-digit range?","Jonathan Ayers","We, in the near-term, it will take time. So\u2026","Brian McKeon","I think we\u2019ll see gradual improvement over the course of the 2019. I think we are coming back to our German organization which moved to Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant model where you have one account manager representing in-house and Reference Lab. They moved to that in the first quarter of 2019, and they had a very good fourth quarter across-the-board and I think that really shows what happens when we get with a little bit of time and territory and learning the new model. I mean, every market is a little different.","Some of them were already there. Some of them are making changes to that model. Some of them are Distributor markets where that\u2019s not really relevant, or markets where we don\u2019t have a Reference Lab business, so there\u2019s a lot of different models internationally, but I think that\u2019s an indication of what we expect to see over the course of 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","David Westenberg","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. So the number, the Instrument placement number blew away my estimates, but the Instrument actual revenue number was a little bit below, at least in trend line. So is that a function of strong international placements? Or is there an increase in rental style contracts?","Brian McKeon","It\u2019s a great question, David. It was up 3%, some of that is the compared to very strong results last year, we really had an exceptional Q4 in 2017, and the other factor we did note was Instrument program mix impacts, and as you pointed out, very strong performance internationally can drive, that and the growth of programs like rental programs internationally, and 360 can have an effect too on the Instrument revenue recognition. They\u2019re all great programs with a high-return, but can have a bit of a moderating affect on growth. So those were the primary drivers.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, I also want to call out David. The U.S. did a great job. They had a tough compare where they were really rocking and rolling in Q4 2017. Q4 2018 was the first quarter of the expansion. Well the most recent expansion, and in the context of the strong compare, and the first quarter expansion, they had a very strong results, as Brian laid out, and were up year-over-year, so but to your point on revenue, there can be a program mix impacts.","As I think international placements are going to generate \u2013 are generally small practices, that\u2019s a fair point, and so each placement generates a little bit less incremental recurring revenue than our U.S. placement, but having said that, I think we\u2019re very, very pleased with the Instrument placements globally in Q4.","David Westenberg","Just maybe just one follow up on kind of the revenue build side. You had 17% consumable growth. That\u2019s a great number right there. Can you maybe help us parse out contribution from SDMA versus kind of organic consumption or consumable utilization and kind of help us understand really what SDMA on the slide is kind of doing there.","Brian McKeon","Yeah, I highlighted that 4% of the consumable growth, the organic consumable growth, in Q4 was a combination of SDMA on a slide and SediVue paper run. They\u2019re pretty equal. I think we\u2019re both contributing I think round about 2%.","Jonathan Ayers","And we\u2019re very pleased with the Catalyst SDMA adoption. We\u2019ve now topped a million runs on Catalyst with SDMA. This adds to the close to total 20 million of SDMA results when we include the reference lab. In the U.S., we have 58% of our practices who have run Catalyst SDMA in the last quarter and 64% who have purchased it. These are really amazing adoption metrics and of course, SDMA is unique to the IDEXX solution, so globally, the metrics are very similar. It\u2019s actually 58% adoption in the U.S. and 56% adoption meaning they\u2019re actually running it. ","Of course, we can uniquely measure that because we have smart service on our instruments which brings all sorts of benefits, including our ability to measure and about 64% of global install base has purchased the SDMA. So these are -- in the first year launch, these are amazing adoption metrics, and it really shows the progress we\u2019ve made on providing education to the field of the importance of SDMA, as being highly correlated with GFR, meaning elevated SDMA, says something is going on and you need to look more closely, and you\u2019re not going to see that with traditional parameters, so it\u2019s a great story.","We\u2019re going to continue with our investments in SDMA education as part of our 2019 marketing plans, but I\u2019m certainly pleased with the adoption rate and as we mentioned it also contributes to the organic instrument consumable revenue growth.","Operator","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. Ayers for any closing comments.","Jonathan Ayers","I want to thank everybody for calling in and I know we\u2019ve got some employees and other constituents and again I want to express my gratitude for really a fantastic 2018. We run the company in a way that delivers the day and secures the future, and I think we had a great delivery in the year, as we\u2019ve enumerated here on this call.","And with the work that our employees do across the world, I think we also made significant progress in securing the future for IDEXX and our customers in the veterinary market, in the Water market, in the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy market and in the human blood gas market through our OPTI Medical systems. And so with that, we will conclude the call and get started on 2019. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

Please go ahead.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay. Thank you, Bonnie. With me is Will Blanche, our VP of Finance and Interim CFO; and also Ed Garber, who is coming back into the role, one of our veteran finance executives and coming back into the role of Director of Investor Relations. So I'm going to just turn over to Will now to take you through the numbers, and I'll come back with some color commentary.","Willard R. Blanche","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for today's call. As reported in our press release, our second quarter revenues were $352.6 million, yielding organic growth of 5.5% and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.99, a year-to-year increase of 9%. Second quarter organic revenue growth was driven by very strong increases in instrument consumables and lab services, partially offset by revenue growth associated with capital and system placements. Earnings per share growth exceeded revenue growth due to strong gross margins, resulting from cost efficiencies and favorable product mix along with augmented shared repurchases. Currency had an immaterial impact on EPS.","As for the economic environment, I wanted to share what we are seeing in the U.S. veterinary market based on data from 700 of our own Cornerstone customers. During the second quarter, patient visits were up 0.7% and practice revenues grew 4.9%, representing a modest improvement over patient visits that grew 0.1% and practice revenues that grew 3.5% in Q1. Growth rates for both metrics did accelerate somewhat over the course of Q2. VetLab instrument and consumable revenue of $112 million grew 9% organically. Instrument revenue of $20.7 million declined 10% organically. Chemistry analyzers placed through volume commitment reagent rental programs in Q2 of this year, which were not used in last year's second quarter, negatively impacted our year-over-year instrument revenue growth by roughly 3%. Adjusted for this, chemistry revenues were up slightly in the quarter. Our worldwide chemistry placements and units were very solid for the quarter, with 14% growth versus prior year and more than a 35% step-up versus Q1. This double-digit year-over-year growth reflects increases in both Catalyst and VetTest placements and was driven by our worldwide sales focus on chemistry instruments, given their importance in resultant consumable stream compared to a hematology placement. We are also very pleased with the quality of these placements, with about 55% of our North American and approximately 50% of our worldwide Catalyst placements going to customers new to IDEXX. Both of these metrics are the highest we've reported since the launch of Catalyst in 2008. For the full year 2013, we maintain our projection for chemistry placement growth to be low single digit, similar to our growth in 2012.","Our worldwide hematology placement saw 18% sequential growth and similar to Catalyst, a little over 50% of worldwide ProCyte placements were to customers new to IDEXX. Total hematology placement declined 11% in the quarter compared to a relatively strong quarter in the prior year and contributed the large majority to total instrument revenue decline. For the full year, we now expect hematology unit placements to be flat versus 2012.","Instrument consumables revenue of $78.5 million grew organically 15% versus the prior year period or 14% when normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. We are very pleased with this normalized growth rate, which represents our strongest quarterly result in many years. Our growth continues to be a function of our increasing installed base and the quality of those placements; increased testing, as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-house labs with Catalyst and ProCyte; an enhanced loyalty from our base of Catalyst customers who now account for 82% of our U.S. chemistry consumable revenues, exclusive of corporate accounts.","On the strength of this result and in light of the strong fundamental volume growth drivers that we see, combined with somewhat higher price realization, we are increasing our expectation for full year normalized organic growth for instrument consumables to 12% to 14% from 11% to 13% previously.","Our second quarter Rapid Assay sales of $46.1 million grew organically 2% versus the prior year period, consistent with Q1. Change in distributor inventory levels did not impact second quarter growth. The growth was impacted by a change in marketing programs over the prior year, which shifts the timing of purchases by practices to later in the year. In addition, we did not see patient visit growth, a key driver of same-store sales, pick up very much in Q2. We continue to expect Rapid Assay growth to accelerate over the remainder of the year, driven by marketing program timing, our expanded sales force and the launch of new products. With half of the year behind us, we are now adjusting the full year growth range to 4% to 5% from the previously provided range of 4% to 6%.","U.S. distributor inventory levels for instrument consumables and Rapid Assays averaged 4 weeks at the end of the second quarter based on forward-looking demand, which is within their customary range.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services business, with revenues of $115.9 million, grew organically 9.5% in the second quarter versus the prior year period, representing a 360 basis point improvement over Q1 2013 and the highest rate of growth we have seen since Q1 of 2012.","Growth accelerated across all geographies. The acceleration in growth has been driven by a fully staffed sales force for the first half of the year that has increased diagnostic testing from our existing customer base. In addition, the increasing adoption of VetConnect PLUS in the U.S. has led to improved customer retention.","Lastly, we believe the 2012 weather dynamic that negatively impacted Q1 2013 growth, as discussed in April, had a slightly favorable impact on Q2 2013. For full year 2013, we continue to expect organic revenue growth for labs and consulting services in the 8% to 9% range or 9% to 10% growth for the second half of 2013.","Our customer information management and digital imaging systems businesses, with revenues of $21.8 million, declined 4.5% organically in the second quarter versus the prior year period. As mentioned in our April call, we had significant turnover in sales reps in Q4 2012 and there's a 6- to 9-month learning curve for new reps. As a result, we have relatively low orders and ending backlog for Q1, which contributed to the lower number of install opportunities for Q2. However, as expected, we saw the order rate accelerate throughout the quarter and we have a healthy backlog at the end of Q2, which positions us well as we head into the second half. While we still project an accelerated growth rate in the second half of the year, given Q2 sales, we now expect to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year versus our prior low double-digit expectation.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 1% organically versus the prior year period to $28.3 million in the second quarter. This performance was driven largely by higher-than-anticipated volumes in European livestock disease programs, including BSE. BSE declined slightly less than expected, due to delayed implementation of changes in EU testing regulations. We now project a low single-digit decline in organic growth for the year for Livestock, Poultry and Dairy versus the low- to mid-single digit decline expected in Q1.","Our water business grew 2% organically versus the prior year period to $22.4 million in Q2, reflecting gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. Year-to-date, the business grew 4%, in line with our thinking and consistent with our expectations for full year organic growth in the mid-single-digit range.","Moving to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin at 56% was 105 basis points favorable to prior year. As mentioned, this was due to cost efficiencies, primarily in lab operations, price realization and favorable revenue mix, with lower margin capital and systems revenue comprising a smaller share of Q2 revenue. Operating expenses were 33.7% of revenue and our effective tax rate at 30.8%, reflected in part the 2013 R&D tax credit.","Turning to cash flow. Our free cash flow was $56 million or 104% of net income in Q2. Consistent with Q1, free cash flow in the quarter is a bit lower than our experience historically, due to spending on our new administrative facility on our main campus.","We repurchased 1.65 million shares during the quarter, representing about 3% of our outstanding stock. This level was higher than the roughly 732,000 shares repurchased in Q1 and was higher than our expectations in April. This activity resulted in about $0.005 of EPS favorability in the quarter. Looking forward, we project full year revenues of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion, which implies a second half organic revenue growth rate of roughly 10% and yields a full year expected organic growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. Full year expected organic revenue growth is down from our previous guidance in April of 7.5% to 8%, reflecting primarily our latest thinking on revenue associated with capital placements. The acceleration in our second half organic revenue growth rate will be driven by 3 primary factors: First, using year-over-year compares; next, 3 sales force initiatives of note; and third, recent investments and innovations.","In terms of easing year-over-year compares, you may recall that in Q4 of last year, our businesses were impacted by a number of items, including Hurricane Sandy, the timing of the Christmas and New Year's holidays and the launch of our reagent rental program, all of which will benefit Q4 2013 organic revenue growth rates. In fact, we expect organic growth to be almost 300 basis points higher in Q4 than Q3, given these items and our growing momentum.","As to the sales force initiatives, there are 3. In our North American digital imaging and customer information management systems businesses, we have growing capacity and experience in our field sales force for these lines in the second half of the year. Second, as Jon will explain in more detail, we are expecting increase in productivity from our North American diagnostic sales transformation with our new Veterinary Diagnostic Consultants. Finally, in Scandinavia, we expect to see improved capital sales as our new direct sales organization continues to gain experience and build relationships after moving to a direct model in Q1.","In relation to recent investments and innovations, we expect Pet Health Network Pro, VetConnect PLUS and our BioResearch business will contribute to accelerated growth in the back half of the year.","Changes in currency rates since our April guidance contribute modest headwind to revenues, and when combined with a change in organic revenue growth mentioned above, lead us to project reported revenue growth for the year of 6% to 6.5% as compared to 7% to 7.5% previously. We expect full year gross margin to be about 55% or 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance, reflecting our latest thinking about revenue mix for 2013 and operating efficiencies. We expect operating expenses to be approximately 35% of revenue for the year, consistent with our previous guidance. Operating margin is projected to be about 19.5%, which represents a year-to-year expansion of about 20 basis points when normalized for currency and the pharma milestone payment in 2012 and offsetting discrete items in the first quarter of this year, consisting of the 2012 R&D tax credit and the Trendset loss reserves. We expect the tax rate to be 29.5% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our previous guidance. Net interest expense is expected to be $2.5 million to $3 million, also unchanged from our previous guidance. And weighted average share count is expected to be down 3% to 3.5% from full year 2012 levels, an increase of 50 basis points from our previous range of 2.5% to 3%, reflecting our latest thinking on share repurchase.","The reduction in share count increases both ends of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.02. This leads to updated full year 2013 earnings per share guidance of $3.42 to $3.48, which compares to our April guidance of $3.40 to $3.46. With this updated guidance, earnings per share growth for 2013 is projected to be 10.5% to 12.5% when normalized for currency and the discrete items mentioned previously, consisting of the pharma milestone payment in 2012, the Trendset loss reserve in 2013 and the impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit on both years. We expect free cash flow of 95% to 100% of net income compared to 100% to 105% of net income previously. This reflects a revised expectation for capital investment of $90 million versus $80 million at the time of our April call, due to investments to support lab growth, IT productivity investments and some future new products.","Now I turn it back to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay. Thanks, Will, for taking us through the numbers. I'm pleased with the organic revenue growth and the acceleration from 3.3% to 5.5% in the second quarter for the whole company, and that being led by CAG at 6.8%, which reflects the strong momentum in instrument consumables and lab services. Our prospects on momentum give us confidence in a projected roughly 10% organic revenue growth for the company in the second half of 2013, via the road map laid out by Will.","As noted in the press release, we're ahead of plan with our diagnostic sales force transformation for the Companion Animal business in North America. North American Companion Animal diagnostics revenues make up approximately 50% of our total revenues, just to give you context. As you know, from our April call, 20% of our diagnostic sales representatives in North America transitioned to their new customer-centric role as a Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant, or VDC, during the second quarter. These VDCs demonstrated their ability in the third month of the quarter to increase the number of customer calls on average by almost 60% versus the prior sales model. In addition, even though these representatives were the first wave of the transformation, had brand-new roles and in most cases a modified or different territory and customers set, they achieved sales performance equivalent to the sales professionals that were operating in our prior model. This is pretty impressive give a performance for the first few months of the first wave. We strongly believe incremental benefits will come as the VDCs enjoy additional time in their new role and new territory. We believe that based on the learnings of the first wave, our second wave, which encompasses the remaining 80% of the diagnostic sales force in North America, including all of that in Canada, that this way, we'll get off to a much faster start. In fact, we're seeing a large portion of the target 60% increase in customer calls per professional taking place right away after training the second wave.","We're also ahead of our plan in hiring experienced professionals to expand our field sales presence, having increased our North American diagnostic field force by 14% at the start of July as compared to the start of April. Turnover from the transition to the new roles and territories has been below our 5% projection -- actually 3%, which really indicates the enthusiasm, I think, the sales organization has for this new structure. And the team has done a great job in hiring experienced sales professionals for the new territories and open positions. Average sales experience of the VDC hires is over 10 years, which is very strong. We're very pleased with that. Training is complete in the U.S. and Canada as of last week for the brand-new representatives of IDEXX as well as the second wave of existing field sales representatives moving into their new VDC roles. And so all the field are now fully in their new roles. Of course, we learned a lot between the first and second wave of the implementation, as we knew we would, and I expect that the new territory model, with a regular calling cycle, smaller territories and -- will generate -- and are projected almost 60% growth in the number of in-person customer call will be quickly adopted within the few -- first few weeks of wave -- for wave 2, whereas it took a few months in wave 1. We're seeing that the new model with smaller geographic territories and a smaller -- more regular, consistent calling cycle really works. Between the higher call productivity and the expanded feet on the street, this equates to approximately an 80% increase in customer contact for our North American diagnostic sales reps. This on call activity will lead to greater customer satisfaction and loyalty, greater account growth and more effective cross-selling of diagnostic modalities.","Our field force for diagnostics alone in North America now amounts to 184 professionals. And these are supplemented by our field sales specialists for digital radiography and customer information management, inside sales, our distribution sales support team, trainers and others, a total of 325 personnel. This number also does not account for our distribution partners, which add another approximately 750 representatives to the resources that help our customers grow their practice by adopting the use of our innovative solutions in diagnostics and information technology.","Let me also provide an update on VetConnect PLUS, our innovative cloud-based service that provides the results for the current diagnostic sample within the context of the patient's complete historical diagnostic history, including all of their reference lab and in-house diagnostic testing, all in one single view. We have now activated over 8,500 practices with this innovative service, including several hundred in Canada, subsequent to the launch in this important country, market on July 1. Utilization of VetConnect PLUS is continuing to gain steam as the primary way to view, analyze and share diagnostic results that are provided by IDEXX and thus, gain insight into the patient's health and medical history, as well as communicate results with the pet owner. Of course, one of the key roles of our new VDCs as diagnostic account managers will be to support our customers in the adoption of VetConnect PLUS, with the superior clinical abilities. We find that once a veterinarian sees their patient's IDEXX results through the lens of a patient's complete diagnostic history and is easily able to share that insight with pet owners in a visually compelling way, they never go back to a fax or printout of only the most recent blood sample data. And why would they, as VetConnect PLUS is a free service? We are on track to continue to expand VetConnect PLUS internationally beyond Canada, with launches in the U.K. and Australia by January and other markets in 2014.","In our Rapid Assay product line, we are launching 3 new products: First, we have already launched IDEXX Angio Detect this July, a test for lungworm, which is a life-threatening canine disease prevalent in the U.K. and Denmark and other countries in Northern Europe. We launched it, as I said, in July. So -- but while 2013 revenues for this test are expected to be modest, the introduction is highly appreciated by customers where lungworm is endemic, as there has not been a good diagnostic test until now. We will also be launching another new Rapid Assay test early in 2014, SNAP Feline proBNP, a screening test for heart disease. This builds upon our cardiac franchise in the reference lab using the same biomarker technology. At the most recent American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine in June, several papers were presented on this biomarker and the SNAP Feline proBNP's efficacy.","In this call, we're also announcing the prospective launch of SNAP Pro, a mobile device that automates the SNAP test, as well as pushes result automatically to VetConnect PLUS in the cloud. SNAP Pro improves staff efficiency and saves our clients money from both loss runs and loss charges from test run. Beta test feedback from customers has been fantastic, as it addresses the pain points associated with using all point-of-care test kits. Of course, once VetConnect PLUS is populated with SNAP results, VetConnect PLUS becomes an even more comprehensive portal for a patient's diagnostic history. Like our other diagnostic modalities, other benefits of VetConnect PLUS come into play for our SNAP test kits, including easy sharing of client-friendly electronic summaries with pet owners of SNAP results and mobile access to those results. We'll be taking orders for SNAP Pro in the fourth quarter, with delivery expected in early in the first quarter of 2014. Our distributors will be quite involved in placing SNAP Pro to our broad set of customers who purchase SNAP test kits, and training of our distribution representatives will begin in August.","Finally, later in the quarter, we'll be introducing IDEXX IMAGEBANK, a software as a solution -- software-as-a-service solution that provides backup and storage for a practice's digital images. IMAGEBANK is designed to archive images directly from the IDEXX PACS software, eliminating the need for manual and expensive on-site storage. Clinicians will also enjoy the convenience of accessing patient images through VetConnect PLUS, enabling remote diagnostic interpretation. Image review is enabled by IDEXX's own customized image viewing software, built upon the highly successful I-Vision Mobile iPad app. IMAGEBANK is another key step in building out our patient-centric diagnostic ecosystem on the cloud.","In summary, we believe we have in place pieces of our strategy to bring real value to our customers globally to help them grow their practices and to drive growth and profitability for IDEXX for years to come.","So with those introductory comments, Greg, I'd like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Jon, I wanted to give you a follow-up on the sales force transformation. I'm curious, your view on how quickly the 60% increase in calls leads to stronger organic growth. And then maybe you could talk about how that manifest and at what rate, via better retention, more utilization with existing clients and then the opportunity to cross-sell them to other modalities of diagnostic testing versus what they currently have.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Ryan, thank you for the question. First of all, we expect the ramp in call frequency because of the smaller territories and because they moved to a regular calling pattern. That ramp is, in the second wave, is happening very quickly and we would expect that to be well in place by the second month of the quarter. And so I think we'll see a greater increase in productivity in the second wave than in the first wave. Now in this new model, what -- our customer has a single diagnostic representative, and that is what's different than in the past. Not only did they not see the rep as frequent, they didn't see the same rep. So they saw 2 different reps, one for the in-house line and one for the reference line. And so seeing the same rep and seeing that rep more consistently, I think, is going to be able to generate a relationship that will allow us to achieve all 3 of those growth parameters that you mentioned. In fact, we believe the vast majority of customers are going to be able to see -- be seen twice a quarter by this rep. And so what that does is it builds a relationship, increases loyalty and retention. And of course, that rep is also going to be helping the customer appreciate, enjoy the benefits of VetConnect PLUS with our diagnostics, which also increases retention, but it also builds that relationship to help us cross-sell. Ryan, as you recall, the majority of our customers who use 1 or 2 of our chemistry and hematology modalities, reference labs at one side or the in-house equipment on the other side, only 36% of that universe actually uses both. So the cross-selling opportunity is pretty big. And then the third area that you mentioned is helping the customer grow. And this really -- what's interesting about the industry is our customers actually want to see our reps because they know our reps can help them with their practice. The biggest complaint we've had in the past is they don't see the rep enough, and we're solving that problem here with a consistent relationship. So how that's going to play? We actually have only modest expectations for the impact of this in our acceleration in organic growth over the second half of the year. You heard the road map that Will laid out, and it was only the second of 3 factors in the sales initiatives, which is itself only one of the 3 factors in the organic growth. But we think it will build momentum over time and position us very, very well for the long term. And they're -- it's exactly unclear how it's going to play out in the short term, but we're very pleased with the success that we had in the wave 1.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful color. And then as a follow-up, maybe a little bit more of a big picture question but related. You've always talked about a somewhat slow adoption curve in the vet space, moving glacially with the new product launches. But do you think the initiatives underway in IDEXX, particularly moving to the more consulted sales team and then introducing more information technology into the practice that you can, perhaps, accelerate innovation and when you think of your new Rapid Assay launches, new test launches actually drive greater utilization of those over a shorter time frame, so that it augments your growth outlook in '14 and beyond?","Jonathan W. Ayers","I think that's very true. One of the areas where we've had -- where you had typically a slow adoption in the veterinary profession is the adoption of new, innovative and highly appreciated test technologies such as, we've launched molecular diagnostics and pancreatitis and cardiac and allergy testing, all new menu, if you will. And the adoption's been slow. And I think one of the reasons the adoption is slow is while we've had a number of resources available to the customer, we haven't had that in-person contact. And one of the things that we found in wave 1 was customer said, \"Hey, I heard you started allergy or I wanted to learn a little bit -- more about those pancreatic tests.\" And so the purpose of these calls is first to address the questions that the customer has. And they're actually quite -- they're quite interested in learning about this, but they really haven't had someone who is fully knowledgeable to be able to take the time as part of the regular call cycle to introduce this. So we could see a more rapid adoption. Clearly, we think the -- while the adoption rate of VetConnect PLUS has been pretty fast relative to our history, we think the adoption rate will accelerate in the new model for the same reason.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First one for me, I was just hoping to get some color on how you're monetizing VetConnect PLUS. We've seen some pretty solid adoption trends there. Just wondering if you can give us some color on how that trend's impacting the business.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well, thank you, David. First of all, VetConnect PLUS is a free service to anyone and, of course, populated with diagnostic information that's generated from IDEXX's modalities. And so we're not monetizing it by targeting subscription. I think what we're seeing and as the adoption increases is customers now get a lot more value out of the diagnostic information that they were getting before from anyone, including IDEXX, because it has it in the context of the history. And what that does is it increases the loyalty of our customer base. And any increase in loyalty, of course, all of the things being equal, increases our growth rate. So I think that's probably the earliest monetization. The second is that VetConnect PLUS makes it very effective for -- very easy for a rep to -- first, to add value with a customer by helping appreciate the benefits of VetConnect PLUS in the modalities that they are using and then cross-sell the other modalities, as they understand that those can also populate VetConnect PLUS. And then third and probably much longer term is direct -- the direct impact of VetConnect PLUS could have on growing utilization of diagnostics, including new, as well as more common types of tests.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then on the CAG gross margin. In the quarter, I was hoping you could break out the improvement we saw related to mix and price and improved efficiencies. I think you mentioned that the lab business, we saw a nice uptick in efficiency there. Just hoping you can give us some -- quantify the impact.","Willard R. Blanche","Sure, I'll take that one. As far as the gross margin for the businesses, reference labs was the primary driver there and it would -- I'd split it out between the 2. It's -- we don't typically do too much of that, but it's primarily reference labs and then supported by the other change with the mix. I'd say more reference labs, though.","Jonathan W. Ayers","We're getting the, of course, the productivity and efficiency and the volume leverage associated with that strong organic growth.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more quick one for me. What's the expected list price for SNAP Pro?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Thank you. That's a good question. The list price is going to be a little under $1,500. But probably the AUP will be less than that because we'll have volume discounts and other types of programs to encourage adoption.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry if I missed this. But can you break down the rental placements in the quarter and the impact it had on the overall instrument sales? And how should we think about the quarterly progression of instrument placements in sales. You'd mentioned that's an easier comp and some other drivers, but if you could break down the key drivers going into the second half, that would be helpful.","Jonathan W. Ayers","In rental, I'm assuming you mean our volume commitment to placements where we don't have upfront recognition of the instrument revenue, so I'll let Will take that.","Willard R. Blanche","Sure. So looking at the trend of volume commitment deals over the past several quarters, we did have that -- those commitment deals step down a little bit in Q2. As mentioned, it only impacted us by 3% in the quarter versus what we had seen previously. And that represents roughly somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 or so chemistry instruments. And just for comparative purposes, back in Q1 and Q4, that averaged around 100. So we are seeing a slowing trend there.","Jonathan W. Ayers","It's obviously replaced by other programs because we had a nice pickup in overall chemistry placements and year-over-year growth.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And can you speak to, I guess, any recent changes in distribution, potentially expanding some of your exclusive distribution relationships to include certain instrument products or capital equipment? How much do you forgo on the margin for some of these relationships? And net-net, are the economics favorable to you?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Thank you. We have -- typically, with distribution in some instruments, had a, what we call a buy-sell relationship with them in the same way that we had consumables. At the request of our distribution partners, we added that. We added the chemistry and hematology instruments to that. A couple of notes: It was -- we don't expect it to be very much of our volume. In fact, I would call it immaterial in the second quarter. And second of all, the economics are no different to us because what we're doing is we're putting this in in replace for a commission or a spiff to distributor rep. And the margin that the company receives is about equivalent to what we would have paid in terms of the spiff. So there's really no change in economics. It's just in some ways, in some cases, the distributor prefer to have this arrangement, and we want to be responsive to our distribution partners.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So sales force on -- or sales representative on the distribution side would have to essentially meet some sort of a threshold to get some sort of commission rate. Is that how it would work?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well, it's -- they -- with all instruments, our sales reps are highly involved. And in certain situations, we do have involvement of the distributor rep. And in that case and in certain cases, just works out better that the distributor can recognize revenue on that instrument placement. It's really revenue recognition for them. But for us, it's the same price because if we paid them a commission, we would just net that against the purchase price. So by -- well, let me reinforce. The primary way that we sell instruments is, by far and away, is with our direct sales force and we really expect this to be a very small, if not immaterial, aspect of our instrument placements in North America, or I should say, in the U.S., where we have -- where we've made this change. And it's something that we want to be supportive of our distribution partners with.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Ross Taylor from CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question, I just wondered if I could have Will repeat what the impact to the changes in distributor inventories was on the instrument consumable growth. And then more substantial question, I just wondered if you could comment at all about some of the new products, any commentary about how the rollout of Pet Health Network Pro is going. And then with regards to the SNAP Feline proBNP test, how do you -- do think this expands the market or does it simply cannibalize your reference lab business for proBNP? Or how might veterinarians use this differently in practice than the current test?","Willard R. Blanche","Perfect. So as far as the impact of the changes in distributor inventory levels, on instrument consumables, there was about 1%. And for Rapid Assays, it was negligible.","Jonathan W. Ayers","So there were a couple of questions in there. So one of them was about Pet Health Network Pro. Just to remind investors, we formally launched Pet Health Network Pro earlier this year, actually I think in March of this year. I think it's become the most robust client patient communication and education service platform out there for the veterinary market. And I'm really quite excited about the impact it's going to have on helping veterinarians communicate and educate pet owners on the attributes of things like preventative health care and in turn, diagnostic testing. The feedback from users really has been outstanding since launch. As you expect with any new software launch like this, penetration is ramping. We have a strong team focused on opportunity. They continue to improve the underlying software. In fact, we had a new release of Pet Health Network Pro. It's a cloud-based system. So when we do a release, everybody benefits from it simultaneously. We had a new release in early July, which adds additional capability. And so I think we're excited about it, both as a revenue generator because it is a subscription-based software as a service but also as a way to help practices to grow. Where we had the most success with Pet Health Network Pro has been with Cornerstone customers, and that makes a lot of sense because it's the only client communication tool that is fully a part of, integrated with and built in to the Practice Management Software. So you can do things like -- have customers generate visits just online as well as direct sharing from the patient record to the patient to the Petly, which is the place that the pet owner has all the patient information. So we're pleased with the ramp and we're building an installed base.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And also if you have time, just any comments about the NT-proBNP part that...","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, very briefly, it's not going to -- nothing cannibalizes. Testing begets testing. We think this continues to build the cardiac franchise. Feline, with cats, the protocol really is more and more accepted that this is a screening test of healthy cats because cats can get the cardiac condition that this tests for, just as an adult. And it doesn't present very nicely, it kind of presents a sudden death in some cases. So we like to catch it a little earlier than that. And so I think this really -- it's just going to build upon our reference lab franchise for cardiac testing and give more awareness. As I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, building adoption of these things takes some time. And when you have multiple modalities that provide a similar category of protocols, in this case, cardiac testing, it helps to expand awareness.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jon Block from Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe, the first one, Jon, for you. I mean, just big picture, if you can to speak to your overall confidence in the back half pickup? And I know you guys gave very good reasons as to why we should see the acceleration in the back part of the year. But to be fair, those reasons also existed before, right, I mean, 3 and 6 months ago when you alluded to them. So you step down the organic by 50 bps in each of the past 2 quarters. Do you feel comfortable that the guidance is where it needs to be? And then maybe, what went on over the past 3 or 6 months that lead to, I mean, it seems capital base, but if you can maybe pinpoint where the shortfall stem from.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, thank you. Thank you for the question. We feel -- we've really taken a close look at the second half. Of course, the second half is where we always thought the step-up would occur. And the second half, at this point, is still in front of us, like it was earlier in the year. The shortfall in the second quarter that you refer to and the step-down in organic growth is associated with capital placements. In some cases, it's really the lower margin capital associated with digital radiography and customer information management, and then the quantity versus the quality of the capital placements. But the -- I'll tell you what the other thing that we feel pretty excited about is the success. As we predicted, overall, in the growing use of the annuity portions of our CAG diagnostic modalities, 76% of the company's revenues are the Companion Animal Group and about 90% of the Companion Animal Group's revenues are the annuity portions of the modality. That'll be all the reference labs, all the instrument consumables and the SNAP kits. And we're now -- we're actually stepping up our guidance for instrument consumables. Those are already pretty strong from -- at 11% to 13% organic growth. And now we're stepping up to 12%, 14%. We are certainly very pleased with the 55% competitive chemistry placements in the second quarter. I think our sales organization has really learned how to do that. They have a lot of confidence now. And then of course we are pleased that lab is progressing, just as we expected, with a 9.5% organic growth in the second quarter. So we think we're on track there. And so that's the important part of the business. And then of course, we have the non-CAG businesses, which are doing, on a whole, as they expected. We're also seeing -- Jon, this is not just the -- it's not just the U.S., it's just not -- not just in North America story, it's a global story. We achieved growth in Europe in the first half of 8.1%. That was -- first quarter was 6.6%, second quarter was 9.3%. There's a little bit of calendarization in that. But 8.1% in our European Companion Animal Group, which I think is a very strong performance given the shape of the European economy, and it's certainly not helping us out. But we have a very strong offering and a very strong strategy and a very strong set of country management teams there. We also achieved close to 10%, 9.6%, to be precise, growth in our -- in IDEXX in the Asia-Pacific portion of the world and we had flat growth in Q1 and 19% in Q2. I think, again, some things are between the quarter, so I take the growth there. We have -- we see a step-up in both of those strong regions in the second half of the year, which is another factor that gives us confidence and the momentum in the second quarter that gives us confidence in the full year organic growth. But what we have not put very much -- stock in yet is the impact of the sales force transformation. There's a small amount in there associated with the acceleration, but it's a very small portion of that step-up. We've -- obviously, people have to learn their new roles, but we're certainly very pleased with what we've seen so far. I tell you, I am very pleased with the level of enthusiasm that we have in our sales organizations. I was with them over the last couple of weeks. And what's different about the second wave than the first wave is the second wave knew it was coming. They knew what their new territory was, as of April 1. They listen to the experience of the first wave reps, and so their enthusiasm builds. And really one of the most common reactions that I got from the sales organization was, \"We're just excited. It's here now.\" Many of our veterans said, \"This is something that is going to be a better experience than we have before. We're really going to be able to take care of customers.\" And I think you can see that in the extraordinary low attrition. We had associated with the change of this magnitude, 3% attrition in the second quarter in our CAG entirety, in our CAG diagnostic sales force in North America in the middle of all these territories changing, and everything, I think, really speaks to where the sales force is on this.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that was very helpful. And actually I was going to ask you about European CAG and APAC and you got to those with your answer. Maybe 1 or 2 other quick questions. I thought what was interesting, you mentioned that it was the biggest quarter competitive win, I think the number was 55%. So what was behind that? Because it seems like it's still a little bit early since you're just going through the sales force transformation. Is that a VetConnect PLUS phenomenon? You mentioned the guys being more comfortable on trying to take away some competitive wins. So what was behind that big number in the quarter?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Well, I think the highest number that we had before the second quarter in North America for competitive, for our new Catalyst placements was 45%. So it was a nice jump from 45% to 55%. Now that number has been growing, really, over the last couple of years, but that was a pretty big jump between the first and the second quarter. And obviously, we still have 80% of our sales organization in the old role, so you can't really attribute that to the sales force transformation yet. I think we really attribute that to the fact that the sales organization is getting more and more comfortable with selling the unique benefits associated with our in-house offering and the benefits of that combined with our reference lab offering and VetConnect PLUS. But it's not just VetConnect PLUS. We have a Real-Time Care value proposition that only IDEXX can provide. We're the only ones that can provide the ease of use and turnaround of sample within a 20-minute patient exam. So I think there are a number of things that we have put in place that help our sales reps communicate the unique value to the IDEXX diagnostic offering, that we really put in place over the last 6 to 9 months that we saw the benefit of in the second quarter. So it's nice to see that momentum and why I would expect that to continue into the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor from Feltl and Company.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Just curious on how much of the organic lab growth was price realization in the quarter?","Willard R. Blanche","Sure. So breaking that out, it's about -- for the total company, it's about -- roughly half. But probably closer to 60% of the growth comes from volume and 40% from price.","Jonathan W. Ayers","On a global basis.","Willard R. Blanche","On a global basis.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. It looks like you guys had a really nice quarter in terms of competitive installs. But the guidance, you're looking for kind of flat hematology and low single digits on chemistry. If you're going to be able to generate that double-digit type consumable growth, how much do you see that coming from growth in testing versus, perhaps, the price realization there?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. The vast majority of that is volume growth. I think it's a very, very small portion of it which is price. But you mentioned the competitive placements, which are, of course, fully contributing to the additional growth. But even when we upgrade existing customers, we see a growth of 25% or more in utilization because of its -- because of the capabilities of the instrument. So we get growth in both types of placements. Of course, the momentum in the first half, this is a momentum business. It doesn't change overnight. You're not going to see -- you're never going to see the change in instrument consumable growth that much from -- on an underlying basis, adjusting for changes in distributor inventory, very much because it's really a quarter's growth is the result of the last 4 or 5 quarters of placement and customer activity. So the fact that we achieved 14% growth in the second quarter tells us -- gives us some confidence for the momentum of going into the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A lot of discussion so far, but it's all limited to 1 or 2. But in terms of the MWI agreement, I know you gave some color on 1Q about their level of commitment and kind of the revenue growth that you saw. Any step-down or any kind of changes with regards to their commitment 2 quarters into the new change?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Thank you. Nick, we continue -- there's really absolutely no change in the story from what we said in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with all of our distributor partners. We look at our distributors very carefully in terms of their -- the revenue that they generate, as well as the engagement their field sales organization have with initiatives that are IDEXX-specific, typically program types and initiatives or initiatives of writing with our -- and working with our sales organization. And when we look at all of those, again, we saw really no change or no difference in these metrics with our nonexclusive versus our exclusive distributors in the second quarter, just as we saw no change. And we really didn't expect any change as we did in the first quarter. What I am excited about going forward is with the new sales -- our direct sales model, where we have a single sales rep for a territory, smaller territory. They now have the opportunity to work with fewer distributor reps because they're not carrying -- covering as large a territory in a more intense basis. And I'm looking forward to that partnership between our rep and our distributor reps in helping the customer grow the practice. And this is what we really need. We know that customers want that help. When they get that help, that their practice responds. And in this economy, they can take control of their destiny a lot more than sometimes they appreciate just by the -- what they're doing with their practice. And so when we partner with our distributors, we can make that happen. And I think that partnership is going to be -- there's going to be a much greater opportunity with that partnership in our new sales -- into CAG diagnostics account manager-type sales model.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then maybe secondly, on Europe, obviously, a pretty solid performance there. You didn't mention Leipzig, Germany, the new reference lab, how is that tracking and kind of how much of that is contributing to the sequential rebound in organic growth relative to 1Q?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. Leipzig is tracking very, very well. We extended it to several more countries in the second quarter as we expected. We like the performance of Leipzig and then the other area that's performing quite well, where we had quite a bit of growth was the Nordic countries, where we went direct. And I don't know, Will, maybe you have the growth in Nordic countries, but it's a pretty high number in the second quarter, as we really came on -- we had a pretty good number in the first quarter but the second quarter is even more unbelievable. So we're very pleased with that initiative. And the Nordic countries are -- these are countries where our diagnostic solutions work very well. They're sophisticated practices. They have a strong -- the pet-owning population has a strong bond with their pets, and their economies are strong. So these are very appropriate markets for us to have an effective solution, where we can combine both the in-house and the reference lab offering. And of course, part of it is we're able to go direct with in-house. The other part of it is that we have the Leipzig lab, which is helping us in those Nordic countries with a very, very attractive and heretofore unknown turnaround time. But we also had good performance in some other parts of Europe. Of course, Europe has got a lot of different economies, and some are doing better than others. For example, we have a very good performance in Italy. Leipzig is actually helping us in Italy. And who would have thought Italy, given the economic situation there. So we're pleased and we have a very experienced management team and set of country managers in Europe, and they're really taking the strategy with a lot of excitement.","Willard R. Blanche","Jon, as far the Nordics, we saw high double-digit growth in the Nordics. So in...","Jonathan W. Ayers","High double digits.","Willard R. Blanche","High teens, high teens.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Lastly, maybe just quickly for you, Will. In terms of gross margins, you've been up over 100 basis points in each of the last 2 quarters. And I think even back to 2012, you're up 100 basis points in the back half of the year as well. Now your guidance for full year would suggest less of an improvement in the back half. Is that more attributed to the mix? Or is there anything -- considering the customer utilization pull-through and kind of still flattish like instrument numbers, I would have anticipated this level of success to continue going forward.","Willard R. Blanche","Sure. There are definitely some mix dynamics because we do expect the instrument placements to rebound a bit in the back half of the year, and so I think certainly that is...","Jonathan W. Ayers","That's in the second half of the year versus first half.","Willard R. Blanche","Second half of the year versus first half.","Jonathan W. Ayers","So we did get mix dynamics in the second half of the year versus the prior year because of the higher proportion of consumables versus instruments. With the drop in instrument revenues, you actually improve your gross margin mix. So I would expect that -- we've seen that sort of sequential step-up in meeting up year-over-year step-up in margin that we saw in the second half of last year and first half of this year. We've kind of gone through that now. So I think we'll continue to enjoy that. But I wouldn't expect it to see a significant further year-over-year increase in the second half of the year, other than what we are achieving in lab versus our productivity.","Operator","And sir, there are no further questions. Please continue.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Great questions. I just want to also congratulate everybody on their performance. The company's been working hard on some of these very, very large transformations, certainly, transformation, the way our customers enjoy the benefits of IDEXX diagnostics and then the transformation on our sales organizations around the world. And so I think it really sets us up well for the second half, and we look forward to continuing to report our progress at the next earnings call in October. And with that, we'll complete the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Merilee Raines.  Please go ahead.","Merilee Raines","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today.  As we reported in our press release this morning, our Q2 revenues were $335.6 million yielding organic growth of 7%; and diluted earnings per share were $0.91, a year-to-year increase of 10%.  Revenues were slightly below our thinking at the time of our April call, the result of a few factors; first, unfavorable changes in currency rates relative to our thinking in April resulted in about $2 million of lower revenues.  Post currency input, somewhat lower growth in reference lab revenues currently offset by stronger growth in instrument consumables revenue in North America, were the primary factors netting to organic revenue growth that was about 1% lower than our expectations.","Earnings per share for Q2 were in line with our thinking in April.  The impact of lower revenues was offset by lower-than-anticipated spending on operating expenses, in part due to discretionary spend and in part due to timing.  While actual currency rates versus expectation yielded a modest unfavorable impact on revenues for the quarter the impact to EPS was immaterial.","As a backdrop to the discussion of our Q2 performance in our companion animal group, the following is what we are seeing in the US veterinary market based on a subset of roughly 500 practices using our Cornerstone Practice Management System.  In Q2, patient visits grew by 4% and practice revenues grew by just over 5.5%.  While both metrics continue to be favorable to the growth rates seen throughout 2011 when patient visits were flat and practice revenues were up 2.5%, they were slightly lower than the Q1 metrics of 5% patient visit growth and 7% practice revenue growth.  Further, the growth rates for both metrics decelerated somewhat over the course of Q2.  We believe this trend indicates that some of the strong pickup in Q1 was due to the mild weather experienced over much of the US.","In Europe overall we saw stabilization of organic growth for our companion animal group segment at 5%.  This is consistent with the growth in Q1 which had seen a step down from 8% in Q4 2011.  As was the case last quarter, the growth rates for this region varied by product and service line and by country.  All in all these data reaffirm our thinking that given the continued challenges to consumer confidence in both the US and Europe, we will see only a modest benefit from the macro environment to volume growth in 2012 over 2011, and the pace of improvement may not necessarily be steady.","Let me now give some further detail on the top line performance of our companion animal group.  Overall, companion animal group revenues grew organically 8% in Q2 or 9% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventories.  Lab instruments and consumable revenue of $104 million grew 9% organically.  Sales of instruments were $23.3 million, a [two-year] organic growth of 15%. As for placements, our worldwide catalyst placements were up 7% and vet [test] placements were flat.  An important placement metric for us as we think about follow-on consumable growth, is the percentage of placements into accounts new to IDEXX, and in Q2 about 40% of the catalyst placements were in that category.","Given first half combined chemistry placement growth of 12% and the more difficult comparison in the second half due to the placement success generated by our protocol-based rebate program introduced in Q3 last year, we project total year combined chemistry placement growth of about 5%.  We saw strong performance in our hematology placements with a combined placement growth of 19%.  ProCye remains an attractive choice for our larger customers, and sales of new and recertified LaserCytes are continuing to do well in accounts with lower volumes.   If you will recall, we launched ProCyte in Japan in Q1.  As anticipated, the market interest is very high and nearly 15% of the Q2 placements of ProCyte were in Japan.  Roughly one-third of placements of ProCyte in Q2 were into accounts new to IDEXX, which we believe is a solid metric given its relatively recent launch.  We expect combined ProCyte and LaserCyte hematology placement growth to be 15% to 20% for the full year.  ","Consumable revenues of $68.9 million grew organically 7% or 10% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels.  This is a modest acceleration from the 9% growth that we experienced in 2011 and Q1 of this year, a [reflection] of our growing installed base increased testing in the neighborhood of 15% to 20% as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-clinic labs with Catalyst and ProCyte; and increased same-store testing as a result of improving patient visit metrics.  We now expect full-year 2012 normalized organic growth for instrument consumables to be 9% to 10% based on the momentum of each of the growth drivers just noted.","Our Q2 rapid assay sales of $45.6 million grew organically 4%.  When normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, revenues grew by 5%.  This growth, though down from the 10% normalized organic growth we saw in Q1 is largely consistent with our thinking at the time of our April call.  We expect that the favorable impact on growth from price to be lower sequentially due to the benefit experienced in Q1 from changes to seasonal marketing programs have resulted in lower discounts.  We continue to project 4% to 6% normalized organic growth through the year as we anniversary the list price increase we took in the latter part of 2011.","US distributor inventories for instrument consumables and rapid assays averaged four weeks at the end of Q2 based on forward-looking demand, which is within their normal and customary range.  Our records laboratory and consulting services business with revenues of $106.4 million grew organically 7% in Q2.  The majority of our organic growth came from higher test volumes with the addition of new customers.  As mentioned upfront, the overall growth in the quarter fell somewhat below our expectations, driven in roughly equal parts by lower realized pricing and lower than anticipated volume growth primarily in Europe as European performance continued to be affected by economic headwinds.","Volume growth in North America and Asia-Pacific was solid and relatively on par with volume growth rates in 2011.  Lower realized pricing was primarily due to the increasing success we have had over time selling our lab services in conjunction with our in-clinic diagnostic offerings.  In such situations, discounts on laboratory services are used by our customers to purchase our capital equipment \u2013 digital, vet lab and computer systems.  This is a positive for us in that the discounts are invested back into IDEXX.  It is also positive for our customers as when they use our in-house equipment in conjunction with our reference lab they achieve the benefits that come from an integrated approach to diagnostic testing \u2013 test results at the time of the patient visit and deeper insights with follow-on testing at the reference lab.","These benefits are now further enhanced via the consolidation and management of diagnostic information from both venues \u2013 in-clinic and outside lab sources \u2013 with our launch of VetConnect Plus this month in the US.  As for footprint expansion, we opened a new day lab in Connecticut during the quarter, bringing our total global network to 58 labs.  We have plans to open a couple of additional labs over the remainder of the year including a lab in Germany in Q4.  This new German lab will serve as a centralized hub for testing samples picked up by our European logistics partner from customers outside of major metropolitan areas.  The lab and direct ship service through our logistics partner will open up new markets for us in areas of Europe where we do not have lab presence today.  It will also allow us to consolidate evening testing from our visiting European lab to take advantage of scale economies.  This replicates the successful strategy we have employed in the US through our methods lab and will greatly enhance our reach and service levels across Europe and including the Nordic countries.","For full-year 2012 we now expect organic growth for labs and consulting services of 8% to 9%.  This change from our previous guidance of 10% is due to the expected continuation of the factors that we mentioned in both our Q1 call and today \u2013 lower pricing realization due to marketing programs that benefit our total CAG business combined with lower testing volume in Europe due to the economic environment.  That having been said, we do expect the impact of marketing program lab discounts to abate somewhat over ensuing quarters as the number of bundled yields per quarter is now leveling off after ramping through 2011 and early 2012.  ","Our practice management and digital imaging systems, with revenues of $22.1 million, grew organically by 24% in Q2.  Implicit in the full-year organic growth guidance of high single to low double digits that we provided in April was Q2 growth in the high teens given a relatively weak year-to-year compare.  The better than anticipated Q2 performance reflects both products lines benefitting from market momentum driven by our steady rollout of enhancements to the offerings.  Customers continue to appreciate ongoing software innovations that support practice efficiency, better medicine and client communications.  We now expect low- to mid-teen double digit organic revenue growth for this line for 2012.","Our livestock and poultry diagnostic revenues declined 4% organically to $23.1 million in Q2.  This decrease was in line with our expectations, driven largely by the events we had mentioned previously including a decline in BSE revenues due to the change in the EU testing regulation and the step down in testing from an eradication program in Germany.  We project relatively flat organic growth for the year for poultry and livestock diagnostics.  This implies a second half growth of 6% to 7% driven by a couple of factors.  Frist, BSE, which was a significant drag on growth in the first half should have a negligible impact on second half growth as we anniversary in Q3 the change in the EU testing regulation.  Second, we anticipate a moderate pickup in growth from new products and certain government programs from their levels in the first half.","Our water business grew 5% organically to $22 million, reflecting contributions from new accounts in North America and gains in our core Colilert testing business in Europe.  This growth was in line with our thinking and is consistent with our expectations for full-year organic growth.  ","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin of 55% was in line with our expectation that gross margin in Q2 would be about 100 basis points higher than in Q1 due to some seasonality in our vector-borne disease testing franchise.  Operating expenses at 32% of revenue as mentioned were modestly below our thinking in April, reflecting somewhat lower discretionary spending and timing between quarters.  Our revenue profile was relatively higher parasitic disease testing in Q2 combined with our operating expense profile with certain commercial activities such as trade shows and sales meetings more prevalent in Q1 tends to result in operating expenses as a percent of revenue lower in Q2 relative to Q1.  Our effective tax rate of 31.9% and our share count were roughly in line with our expectations.","As for the balance sheet and cash flow we ended the quarter with $202 million of cash and $247 million of debt for a net debt position of $45 million.  Our inventory balance of $144 million was up by about $3 million from our expectation and from the level at the end of March.  This was due to the receipt of a shipment of ProCyte from our OEM supplier in Q2 that was originally anticipated to occur in Q3.  As we indicated in April, we expect inventory levels to come down over the next couple of quarters and to end the year at approximately $140 million.  DSO at 42 days remains stable and in good shape.  Our free cash flow was $50 million or 98% of net income, a bit lower than our expectations due to the somewhat higher inventory balance as just mentioned and the timing of payables runs.  ","Looking forward, we project full-year revenues of $1.3 billion to $1.31 billion, a decrease of about $10 million to the low and high ends of our range relative to the guidance provided during our April call.  This is a result of the unfavorable impact of currency.  Reported revenue growth is now projected to be 7% to 8% as a 2% unfavorable impact from currency more than offsets a 1% favorable offset from acquisitions.  Our organic growth of 8% to 9% remains consistent with our previous guidance.  The components of growth have evolved as we expect somewhat stronger growth from our instrument consumables and practice information management and digital imaging systems businesses, and somewhat lower growth in our reference laboratory and diagnostic consulting services business.","Consistent with our thinking in April, we project a somewhat improved economic environment to benefit volume growth by about 1% to 2% for the full year.  We continue to project gross margin to be about 54% for the year, about 100 basis points above the full-year 2011 percent; and operating expenses to be between 34% and 35% of revenues for the year.  We expect operating expenses as a percent of revenue to be modestly higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.  This is a reflection of investments we are making to continue to bring innovative products and services to our served markets.  A notable example is the introduction of Pet Health Network Pro, a web-based client communication and education service for veterinarians and their support staff.  VetConnect Plus, which we described in our Q1 call, is also having its full commercial launch this month.","Our expectation for gross margin and operating expenses yields a projected operating margin between 19% and 20% for the year, which represents an improvement of roughly 50 basis points relative to last year when 2011 is adjusted for the favorable impact of discrete pharma payments we received that totals about $4 million.  We expect the tax rate to be between 31.5% to 32.0% for the full year which is unchanged from our previous guidance.  As a reminder, our  projected tax rate is approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than in 2011 due to the fact that we have not incorporated the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in our 2012 rate.","All of this leads to updated full-year EPS guidance of $3.05 to $3.10.  The unfavorable impact of currency relative to rates assumed during our April call accounts exclusively for the decrease of $0.02 to the low and high ends of our range relative to our previous guidance.  Our overall financial outlook related to business performance is consistent with our thinking at the time of our April call.  Details on currency rates implicit in our guidance and our currency rate change sensitivity analysis is included in our earnings press release.  We project free cash flow to be approximately 105% to 110% of net income for the full year.","And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jon for some further comments.","Jon Ayers","Thanks, Merilee.  Overall we had a solid quarter and are tracking to our goal of achieving 8% to 9% organic growth set at the constant currency.  Like all companies that do business internationally, we\u2019re impacted by the strong dollar and our guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rates accordingly.  Regarding the economy, after the early part of the year that benefited from favorable weather comparison in North America we see the resumption of a more continued slow improvement in our markets.  Success comes at the individual customer level in the companion animal market.  It is this segment of our customers that are effectively responding to the needs of the pet-owning clients that are seeing strong growth in their practice, and our strategy is to provide the tools to help drive that growth and get more customers to adopt those tools.","In the area of new products we\u2019ve been particularly productive in 2012 within our companion animal group, which makes up 82% of the company\u2019s sales.  So far this year we have introduced or plan to introduce shortly an impressive list of new tests, services, and software solutions.  Let me list a few.  In April as investors know, we started shipping SNAP 4Dx Plus, an upgrade to our highly successful SNAP vector-borne disease test that added two new tick-borne diseases to a single kit, bringing the total number of diseases detected in one SNAP to six.  The response on that has been very, very favorable.","In April we introduced the Pet Wellness Plan service in partnership with [VerenaCare].  In April we began shipping phenobarbital for our Catalyst Dx chemistry analyzer, a new test that is receiving rave reviews for the value it brings to a patient that is prescribed phenobarbital for therapeutic treatment and the ability to test right on site for that level.  We are saving and improving lives with this new test according to feedback we are receiving from practices who started using the Catalyst Dx.  Also in May we introduced allergy testing in our reference labs in conjunction with GREER.  This is a whole new category of testing that addresses a common condition in dogs and continues to build upon our strategy of specialized testing capability that sets IDEXX reference labs apart.","Fifth, in June, we introduced a new version of our digital radiography [Constant] software v3.6 that adds Image Coach which guides the physician through the process of taking a high-quality digital image, a very helpful feature that ensures first shot quality.  Sixth, just this week we\u2019ve formally launched VetConnect Plus after a beta phase, a capability I introduced in the April call.  VetConnect Plus is a cloud-based service that allows a veterinarian to see a patient\u2019s entire blood work history from IDEXX both in-clinic and at the reference lab in one interactive screen.  The history allows for trend analysis which adds a whole new dimension to the value of blood work for the practitioner and the pet owner.  The customer signup for this new service has been amazing and we are close to 500 customer activations between our beta customers and a couple of hundred that have signed up so far this week.","Seven, also this week we introduced, as Merilee mentioned, Pet Health Network Pro, a new cloud-based service that will support the practice\u2019s ongoing relationship with their clients between appointments.  By improving communication and increasing client understanding of pet health and the value of veterinary care, Pet Health Network Pro helps practices promote the importance and the relevance of the veterinarian, which increases both visits and revenues per visit at the practice level.  And eight, in August we\u2019ll be providing a new set of capabilities that will upgrade our franchise hematology analyzers, both LaserCyte and ProCyte.  First, they\u2019ll both be able to run body fluids other than blood, a sought-after capability that is unique to IDEXX.  Second, we\u2019ll be adding several new species and third, in particular in ProCyte, we\u2019ll be adding the capability to detect the presence of banded neutrophils and nucleated red blood cell counts \u2013 huge additions to the existing CDC parameters that help determine conditions such as inflammation and other significant abnormalities.  Again, these capabilities are totally new to any veterinary hematology analyzer, and previously these parameters could only be determined by looking at the blood sample under a microscope.","That\u2019s eight new important and significant products and services launches in five months, and each adds value to the whole companion animal group offering continuing to build upon the strong foundation of instruments, test kits, lab services, digital imaging and information technology offerings that we have today in the market and which we think are unique to the veterinary market.  These products and services expand the practice of veterinary medicine.  With these product launches we are truly achieving our mission of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.","As to the matter of our US distribution strategy we discussed in April, there\u2019s not much to report other than our process is moving forward in discussions with our distributors and that no decisions have been made.  At this time we anticipate that we\u2019ll have identified a general distributor and have agreed at least preliminarily on the terms of a generalist agreement by Labor Day.  It is still our assumption that the effective date of any changes to our distribution agreement will be January 1, 2013.  In terms of how we are reaching a decision on what changes to make, we are looking at all the relevant factors including the degree of each distributor\u2019s interest in becoming a generalist, the historical performance of each distributor in selling IDEXX products, and any unique strategic attributes that each distributor might bring to [elevate] our relationship going forward.  As expected, we continue to keep the FTC informed and they are monitoring the process closely, and are also in regular communications with our distributors.","As you have seen in our press release we\u2019re very pleased to announce the promotion of several of our executives to Executive Vice President, with two filling new operating roles: Michael Williams and Johnny Powers.  Michael and Johnny have each made significant contributions to the success of IDEXX to date and I am delighted they are taking on expanded portfolios.  ","In addition, we have filled a third operating Executive Vice President role with Jay Mazelsky who comes to us from Philips Healthcare, where he was General Manger and Senior Vice President of Computer Tomography, Nuclear Medicine and Radiation Therapy Planning.  In that role he led a business that is well over $1 billion in scale.  One of Jay\u2019s accomplishments was to lead the revitalization of Philip\u2019s Computer Tomography Unit and over the last several years has brought an improved innovation in the product line; and through better delivery of customer service his Business saw several points of North American market share gain in the world\u2019s biggest and most competitive diagnostic imaging region.  He\u2019s got a great track record, he\u2019s a seasoned executive and we think he\u2019ll be a great addition to our Senior Team.  He\u2019ll be an effective leader in innovation and growth and help us take the company to a new level of scale and profitability.","In addition to the three operating EVPs that I just mentioned, we\u2019re elevating Merilee Raines whom you know, and Bill Brown, our Chief Scientific Officer, to the Executive Vice President level in recognition of their contributions and the importance of both finance and technology to the ongoing success of IDEXX.  We were also pleased to announce the addition of Ann Szostak to our Board of Directors effective earlier this month.  Ann brings extensive executive and board experience to IDEXX, and we are delighted to have someone of her caliber in this important capacity.","In summary, we\u2019ve had a solid quarter.  We have a strong new product momentum, an augmented management team and Board of Directors, and a good outlook for the remainder of the year.  So at this point I\u2019d like to open it up to Q&A.","","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly.  (Operator instructions.)  Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.  Please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Yeah, good morning; thanks for taking my question.  I\u2019ve got one macro and then one company-specific follow-up.  On the macro you mentioned in your prepared comments that the end market slowed a bit in Q2, which is not surprising, but also that you saw some deterioration throughout the period.  And I\u2019m curious first off if you can talk about the magnitude of that slowdown through Q2, and then number two, is there any ability to perhaps determine how much of that was weather-related?  Maybe it was more flea and tick weakness throughout the quarter; anything you can help with kind of setting that between macro weakness and pull forward weakness would be helpful.  ","Jon Ayers","Ryan, it\u2019s certainly a question of great interest to us all.  To answer the first part of the question, I think the growth was a couple points less in the third month than it was in the first two months but I do caution that monthly data can be quite noisy because you\u2019ve really got a very small amount of time that you\u2019re measuring that year-over-year compare.  It\u2019s hard for us.  We don\u2019t really have direct visibility to the flea and tick piece and pull forward and such, so it\u2019s just really hard to speculate.  Certainly there was a very favorable weather compare in Q1 which we mentioned in April, and I think it\u2019s not a secret to anyone that consumer confidence and general economic trends seemed to deteriorate a little bit over Q2 and that was consistent with I think what we saw in our markets, again subject to, with a caveat, a volatility in monthly data.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then the company-specific, just with the resolution of the distribution agreement it sounds like it now may be in place by Labor Day.  Does that mean in Q4 you\u2019ll start to make some changes and is that contemplated in your guidance related to things like maybe ramping up your direct sales force?  Or will that really mostly take place in F13?  Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Yeah, thanks.  Of course I\u2019ll remind investors that our distributor contracts do go through the end of the year, and it is our anticipation in our discussion with our distributors, although anything can happen, that they would like us to honor those contracts through the end of the year.  So any actual changes that would take place in that conflated scenario would be at the beginning of a new contract year of January, 2013.  And so our guidance really incorporates all the different moving parts of the company and we would see that that transition is something that we can manage within our numbers.","Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you.  And our next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray.  Your line is open.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi, good morning, Jon, and congratulations, Merilee.  The first question I have, just if you could maybe give us an update on Europe?  It sounds like on the reference lab side we might have seen a little weakness there.  Do you think this has stabilized or are you expecting some additional deterioration throughout the year?","Merilee Raines","David, as I mentioned, even though the overall companion animal group growth in Europe was constant at 5% in Q2 as with Q1, it did vary by product line, vary by country.  It\u2019s really hard for us to predict where that will go.  I think implicit in our guidance is we\u2019ve kind of presumed that what we\u2019ve seen will just continue, and obviously we\u2019re closely monitoring the situation.  But you know, that was just a little bit tough to call.","Jon Ayers","Yeah, and in the meantime of course we will be starting that new significant lab during Q4 and we\u2019ll get a little benefit from that as it starts up.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay.  And then I\u2019m not asking for any 2013 guidance here, but just as we kind of think about the impact from the distributor change, any kind of initial thoughts of should we assume there\u2019s a little bump up in sales and marketing or any kind of color there?","Jon Ayers","Well, we anticipate that the impact on the changes and the modest refinements in the composition of our marketing and sales and channel costs, where we have\u2026  Whenever we will have a difference in advocacy at the distributor level we will replace with direct costs \u2013 I don\u2019t think the bottom line will be different or the trends will be different, although of course the composition might be a little bit different.  So we really see as we mentioned in the April call, that any shifts will offset each other.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Your line is open.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions.  On the consumables side of the business can you break that down by volume and maybe how it was trending in the US in particular?","Merilee Raines","Erin, as far as the instrument consumables, almost all that growth and virtually all the growth is due to volume; it\u2019s very, very minimal price.  And as I mentioned, the growth was particularly strong in North America.  As you might expect it was a little bit less though actually, up a bit in Europe from Q1 to Q2 and the increase continues to be strong in Asia-Pacific.  So it\u2019s a good solid growth across regions.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then on the reference laboratory type of business it\u2019s obviously with the slight deviation from that 10% trajectory you\u2019ve seen I guess over the last several quarters.  You mentioned some of the marketing changes before, but were some of the more competitive pressure involved particularly in the US?","Merilee Raines","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any change in the competitive environment.  That\u2019s always been pretty intense, as we\u2019ve said, and I really do think that what we\u2019ve found is that you know, our ability with our strong offerings and the fact that they\u2019re increasingly becoming more integrated in the way that they work together, that there\u2019s just a real opportunity for us to drive growth in all areas by selling these products and services together.  And it\u2019s just the way that accounting works that the expense of these programs is largely born by [less] but the benefit accrues across our companion animal group business.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great.  Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King.  Please go ahead.","Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King & Associates","Hi, this is my first question.  I just wondered if you could give any color on what the role or function of the new Executive that you hired from Philips is going to be.","Jon Avery","We are, between the three, they\u2019ll take large responsibility collectively for the lines of business and the regions of the company.  Michael Williams is going to move to run our international business, and also the water, livestock and poultry diagnostics, dairy; and retain responsibility for OPTI Medical Systems.  All four of those businesses are the majority international.  We really see a very significant opportunity around the world to grow our businesses and we\u2019re really delighted to have Michael do that, and so that leaves the instrument business where Jay Mazelsky will take leadership in addition to the software businesses of the companion animal group and our North American commercial region.  ","And then Johnny Powers will continue to run the lab services business but will have an expanded portfolio that includes also what we call the rapid assay or the [neo] assay business, really the specialized test development business that goes both into the test kits and reference labs, as well as our worldwide operations and our bioresearch strategy.  As you know, we made an acquisition in November which we\u2019re very excited about it.   It\u2019s not a big opportunity but we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunity in bioresearch so that will be his portfolio.","They\u2019re going to work very closely together.  They\u2019ll work very closely with me because really everything is connected to everything else at IDEXX and so we\u2019ve very pleased with this new team.","Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King & Associates","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then my second question is I just wondered if you\u2019d help me understand the lower price realization on the lab side compared to I think your earlier expectations.  Is that simply a function of you\u2019re just selling a lot more products through the bundle of deals and that\u2019s where the impact is coming from, or is it just something else?","Merilee Raines","Yes, that is the case, Ross.  Really the change there is largely a result of these marketing programs, and again, just the way that the accounting works for those.  The cost is borne primarily by the reference labs.  I do want to just emphasize, though, that we are getting price realization.  There is price growth in the lab business; it\u2019s just that, as we talked about a year ago at this time, maybe a third of our growth was coming from price realizations.  Now that price realization is a good 2.0 points to 2.5 points left on that.  So there is still growth there.","Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King & Associates","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.  (Operator instructions.)  We\u2019ll go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates.  Please go ahead.","Nicholas Jansen \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Hi, yeah, just a quick question on the distribution changes.  I wasn\u2019t sure if you guys were anticipating any impact on inventories in Q4 as you would anticipate the generalists to perhaps cut back on inventories, or how does that change?","Jon Ayers","Well one of our anticipated elements of this is that the generalists would continue to carry our product lines, so I don\u2019t really see\u2026  We would fully anticipate they would continue to carry the product line as generalists into 2013.  And so I\u2019m not sure that that would impact much of a change.","Nicholas Jansen \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Okay, and then back on the reference lab side of things, I know you guys have been successfully capturing share over the last three or four years relative to your largest peer.  Are you starting to see maybe the easier share gains starting to subside and maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s contributing a little bit to the slower growth?  Or is it just on the European side and you\u2019re continuing to have success on the North American side?  Thanks","Merilee Raines","Nick, I would just reiterate that the volume growth that we are seeing in North America is very consistent with what we saw last year.  So I think that this really, as far as volume goes the primary contributor was Europe; and as I said, in equal parts though, a contributor is the impact of price.","Jon Avery","Exactly.  And in addition we continue to be excited about the reference lab opportunity and to make investments in the reference lab.  I mentioned in my opening comments the allergy testing which I think is a major category.  Dogs get really itches and skin rashes and it\u2019s really a real problem, and we have really not been a large commercial lab that\u2019s offered a comprehensive allergy testing and immunotherapy business.  And so we\u2019re excited about that.","The other thing that I want to reiterate is VetConnect Plus and the ability to see the historical data on a patient, whether that data came from IDEXX reference labs or the in-house, it\u2019s really exciting.  And I think it\u2019s adding a new dimension, a new level of excitement to our customers.  You can see it by close to 500 practices have already started using, not only just signed up but they\u2019re actively using this capability.  They\u2019re seeing just as you see, it\u2019s a lot more interesting to look at several years of a company\u2019s financial history than it is to look at a one-year snapshot.  They\u2019re really valuing it and it\u2019s given a lot of energy to our sales force to continue to sell the IDEXX innovation into the market.","So the nice thing is that we\u2019ve got some nice new, we\u2019re taking it to a new level in the reference lab as we are in the in-house side of our diagnostic offering.","Nicholas Jansen \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Thanks, and maybe if I can just squeeze in one more in terms of the companion group gross margin.  It was down a little bit year-over-year, and is it more just on the reference labs not getting the price realization?  I would have assumed that with the pretty strong consumable growth that we would have saw a little bit of leverage there.  Thanks.","Merilee Raines","Nick, it is really not a result of pricing.  I mean look, year-over-year again there was price realization so that was not a drag.  We did, there is however some mix impact just as you again, are looking year-to-year in the relative growth rates of the business. Some of our relatively lower gross margin businesses have been growing at a faster rate than the relatively higher businesses, and so that mix impact was really about a point of un-favorability year-on-year.  So counterbalancing that is really a couple of different things: we had some favorable impact from currency and that is a function of the hedging gains that we have this year versus having hedging losses last year; and also the price realization that we\u2019ve been getting in our rapid assay business.  So there\u2019s a few puts and takes going on there but that kind of all in all led things to be relatively on par year-over-year, but mix is the primary unfavorable impact.","Nicholas Jansen \u2013 Raymond James and Associates","Alright, thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  (Operator instructions.)  We will go to the line of [Del Hader with Salestel and Company].  Please go ahead.","[Del Hader \u2013 Salestel and Company]","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.  On VetConnect Plus, is there a revenue component associated with that or does it just help to solidify your position within the practice?","Jon Avery","Yeah, thank you for that question.  There is not a revenue component today.  We\u2019re offering this as a service at no charge associated with using IDEXX diagnostics, whether they be in-house or reference labs.  It is a cloud-based service.  It can be accessed via browser and that would be on a PC or laptop; it can be accessed inside of Cornerstone if you\u2019re managing your medical records with Cornerstone, and we have 6000 Cornerstone customers; and it can be accessed on a tablet such as an iPad.  So you run the diagnostics in the back, with the in-house lab for example, and second you\u2019ve got it on the tablet to show it to the pet owner.  ","It just really supports real-time care in addition to that whole integrated view of the patient with the history.  So it is a real differentiator for our four diagnostics lines and really it brings the context that whether the diagnostics are run in-house or in reference labs they\u2019re important parameters, and it doesn\u2019t matter.  And what\u2019s really important is monitoring the health of the patient.","[Del Hader \u2013 Salestel and Company]","That sounds like a very nice product.  And then on the distribution side of things, have multiple distributors expressed interest in taking on the generalist role or do you plan on choosing a single distributor to be the generalist come next year?","Jon Avery","In our conversations, I think the first preference of all three distributors was to be value-added.  I think they built value on the IDEXX relationship over the long time period they\u2019ve been associated with us and our level of innovation.  And so but we are in discussion with all three of them with regard to that value-added role going forward versus what a generalist role would be going forward.  We want to have a relationship with the generalist that is strong and we need to be able to compensate them at a level that will maintain the acceptable level of services that we receive from them; and our goal is to provide the best result for both our business and the business of our distributors while being attentive to the issues of the FTC\u2019s concerns.  And as I said we believe, while we can\u2019t guarantee we believe that moving this would address the FTC\u2019s concerns.  And so we\u2019re in discussions with distributors and flexible as to how we might get there, and in the context of two value-added and one generalist.","[Del Hader \u2013 Salestel and Company]","Okay great, that\u2019s helpful.  Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question will come from the line of Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti & Company.  Your line is open.","Mitra Ramgopal \u2013 Sidoti & Company ","Yes hi, good morning.  Just a quick question as it relates to Europe: you said you had another lab there.  Are you seeing some opportunity in terms of just [speaking of] to grow or expand as a result of the weakness there?","Jon Avery","I would say just to be clear, we are going to be opening another central lab in continental Europe in Q4 but we have been opening labs there all the time.  I say that our growth is despite the economic [reasons], not as a consequence; but there clearly is an opportunity to provide superior reference lab services across the geographies of Europe.  That\u2019s a growth opportunity and that\u2019s a growth opportunity that\u2019s there somewhat independent of the economy.  Certainly the economy impacts our business but not to the extent that we aren\u2019t generating good solid, continued mid-single digit growth in our labs in Europe which I think is a pretty impressive accomplishment given all that we\u2019ve heard that Europe is dealing with at this point in time.","","Mitra Ramgopal \u2013 Sidoti & Company ","Thanks.  I also have a quick question as it relates to the medical device tax for next year.  I just wanted to be sure, does that impact you in any way?","Jon Avery","Not in the veterinary business, and I guess I would put this in the area of very, very immaterial: our OPTI  Medical Systems sells in the human market but the majority of those revenues are, a good majority of those revenues are outside the US.  To the extent they\u2019re inside the US I think they are.  I\u2019m not entirely sure but I think they would be subject to that tax, but that\u2019s a very, that\u2019s well less than 1% of IDEXX\u2019s revenues.","Mitra Ramgopal \u2013 Sidoti & Company ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  We have a follow up from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Your line is open.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up.  I guess there seems to be some varying news out there on the market opportunity associated with the anticipated distribution changes.  And I guess it seems to be different than maybe what you have articulated.  Where is the disconnect here, or how should we think about this disconnect amongst the industry constituents?","Jon Avery","Well, I would say, I can really only speak from our perspective.  First and foremost, our strategy is providing great innovative products and services that help the practice deliver a higher standard of care, be more efficient, provide more client value.  And that is the hallmark of IDEXX; it\u2019s the hallmark of our strategy.  Our sales and marketing, of which distribution is a piece but of course we have a very significant direct sales force in the US, is a way to bring those innovations to the market, but really it starts with the innovations and then we have some marketing and channel strategies to do so.  ","So we remain excited, and as you can see just in the last five-month period the level of additional innovations that we\u2019re bringing to the market that build upon real-time care and the deeper insight of our highly differentiated reference labs, and the unique capabilities of our SNAP test kits \u2013 the vast majority of that is unique and proprietary capability; not to mention the information technology offerings which saw a really nice growth in Q2.  We really think that that is the hallmark of IDEXX, and so these changes in our distribution strategy are a refinement to a piece of our go-to-market strategy in one, albeit an important, country \u2013 the US \u2013 that is the executional component of that innovation strategy.","So I think when you start from that perspective you really see that this is a refinement as opposed to thinking that distribution is everything.  It\u2019s different in this market.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yep, that\u2019s great.  Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Next we\u2019ll go to the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray.  Your line is open.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up question. The question that I have, I just want to get an update: has FTC actually signed off on this as kind of a strategy to resolve their concerns?","Jon Avery","Well, we can\u2019t ever guarantee what the FTC might or might not do.  And there\u2019s always the risk of regulatory action \u2013 I mean that\u2019s just the nature I think of the environment that we\u2019re in, and that doesn\u2019t really go away until we have a consent decree in place.  But as we said in April, we\u2019ve gone down this path of identifying a generalist distributor both because we felt it was an acceptable solution from a business perspective and because we believed it would satisfy the FTC\u2019s concerns.  Of course those beliefs came from our discussions with the FTC. ","As you can imagine, we wouldn\u2019t have undertaken this very public process if we didn\u2019t have confidence in the prospects of avoiding litigation based on our discussions.  And I just might note, David, that since April we\u2019ve communicated regularly with the FTC regarding the status of the process and we know they\u2019re also in regular communications with our distributors.  And to our knowledge, the FTC is still putting their process on hold of proceeding to litigation as we pursue this solution.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  And our final question is a follow-up from the line of  [Del Hader with Salestel and Company].  Your line is open.","[Del Hader \u2013 Salestel and Company]","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up.  Do you plan on any increased incentives or rebate offerings in the second half of this year prior to the distribution agreements or one of them changing?","Jon Avery","No, not anything in the context of the evolving nature of our distributor relationships.","[Del Hader \u2013 Salestel and Company]","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, and with that, speakers, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jon Avery","Alright, thank you.  I\u2019d like to thank everybody for attending the call.  I want to congratulate also all the IDEXX employees that have been involved in bringing Q2 to conclusion and bringing these innovations to the market.  We really have just really a lot of excitement at IDEXX on this, and so I do appreciate the investors\u2019 interest in IDEXX and we look forward to continuing to update you as the year progresses to its conclusion.

IDEXX delivered continued high revenue growth and excellent financial results in the first quarter. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth driven by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. As expected, FX impacts from the strengthened U.S. dollar reduced reported revenue growth by about 3%. ","Operating margins improved 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, better than projected, reflecting strong gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth as well as timing delays related to select IT and R&D project spending. EPS was $1.17 per share, up 16% on a reported basis or 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis. ","Strong revenue growth and operating margin gains drove 21% constant currency operating profit growth. We also recognized about $0.02 per share in upside related to higher than projected tax benefits from stock compensation activity. In terms of our full year guidance, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth, reflected in our consistent guidance range of $2,385 billion to $2,425 billion in annual revenues. We\u2019re increasing over 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $4.76 to $4.88 per share.","This incorporates an increase of about $0.07 from an updated outlook for 80 basis points to 110 basis points in full year constant-currency operating margin improvement, $0.01 to $0.02 per share and benefit from updated interest expense projections, and $0.01 to $0.02 in upside related to updated effective tax rate projections. Our operating margin outlook factors in additional investments were advancing this year and reference lab capacity, corporate customer support resources and customer-facing software capability while continuing to deliver a strong operating margin improvement and comparable constant currency EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals. ","We\u2019ll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments, let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Q1 results were supported by continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $509 million, up 10% organically by 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 7% overall and 6% organically with overall revenue gains constrained by comparison to very strong prior year digital imaging system placement levels. ","Veterinary software services revenue grew at a high-single digit rates organically in Q1, reflecting very strong skills across \u2013 results across our practice management platforms with the continued growth of our PIMs and applications installed base supporting expansion of recurring software services revenue. Our digital imaging business continued to achieve high levels of digital radiography system placements and high growth in recurring Web PACS subscription revenue linked to our expending installed base. ","Our Water business revenues grew 8% organically in the first quarter to $30 million, reflecting continued solid growth in the U.S. and double-digit gains in international markets. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 4% organically. Gains in herd health screening, poultry and pregnancy products sales were offset by moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues, continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and continued pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from the African swine fever epidemic in China. ","By region, U.S. revenues were $358 million in the quarter up 9% organically, driven by 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of an approximate 1% equivalent day headwind. Strong U.S. gains reflected continued double-digit growth in reference lab and consumables and solid mid-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were primarily volume driven with U.S. net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. ","In terms of our broader U.S. market trends, this quarter, we significantly revamped and expanded our reporting from our data set from approximately 7,500 practices, representing five different practice information management systems. We\u2019ve also refined our weighting framework based on practice as in region prepared in collaboration with Animalytix. We\u2019re now providing same-store growth in clinical visits for practice augmenting our quarterly reporting on total same-store visit and revenue growth for Companion Animal Veterinary visits of all types. ","In Q1, we saw improvement in total visits per practice growth to 1.3% year-on-year with clinical visits for practice growing at a greater amount of 2.2%, an overall revenue per practice growth of 5%. Please note that these metrics are on a same-store basis and do not include growth benefits from incremental practice formation, which we estimate at approximately 1% annually. ","The Q1 2019 earnings snapshot on our website shows quarterly data on clinical visit growth for 2018 and Q1 2019 as well as some additional information we\u2019ve added that describes our measurement methodologies and refinements we made towards historical data to reflect the additional insight we\u2019ve gained from our data analysis efforts. ","International revenue in Q1 were $218 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by strong 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including continued 20% plus organic growth in consumable revenues as we benefit from 30% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base outside of the U.S. We saw modest benefits from advanced ordering in the UK ahead of the Brexit deadline, which added approximately 2% to international consumable growth in Q1.","International reference lab growth was in the mid-single digit range, as we continued to advance commercial efforts targeted on accelerating growth in this line of business, while sustaining strong momentum in expanding our catalyst install base in international markets. In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by continued progress in driving catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. The quality of our instrument placements were strong in Q1. We achieved 207 placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 7% with a higher tax rate of premium hematology instruments, which drove a solid increase in EVI, our measure of multiyear economic value of instrument placements. ","We also placed 122 second catalysts at IDEXX accounts in North America, compared to 59 in Q1 2018, supporting growth in customer utilization at larger accounts. Internationally, we placed 633 catalysts at new and competitive accounts, up 20%. By region, competitive and new catalyst placements represented 69% of total placements in North America and 62% internationally. ","Strong catalyst placement results and continued high retention is reflected in 24% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. Overall, we placed 2,775 premium analyzers in Q1, down 2% compared to very strong prior year levels. Q1 results were led by 1,463 catalyst placements globally, up 4% overall supported by 442 placement in North America, a 20% year-on-year increase. And 1,020 placements in international markets, down 1% compared to record prior year results, which included high levels of VetTest upgrades in emerging markets. ","As noted, we saw a high attach rate of premium hematology instruments with chemistry placements in Q1, which supported 823 premium hematology instruments globally, up 9%. SediVue placements were 489 in Q1, down 26% versus very strong prior levels impacted by our exceptional SediVue placement performance in Q4 as well as our commercial focus in Q1 on capturing high EVI, new and competitive catalyst placement opportunities. ","In addition to strong premium placement results, we drove continued momentum with SNAP Pro with 1,999 placements in the quarter. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 were $29 million, a 3% decrease organically of a tough compare in 2018, which included mix benefits from very strong placements of higher price SediVue instruments. ","Benefits from an expanding instrument base, test innovation and enhanced commercial capability continue to drive strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities. Instrument consumable revenues of $167 million grew 15% organically in Q1. Results reflected double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued 20% plus growth in international markets. High volume-driven consumer gains continue to be supported by expansion of SediVue paper run and estimates live revenues, which contributed approximately 3% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter. ","Reference lab and consulting services with revenues of $203 million grew 11% organically in the first quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains strong reflected in solid double-digit volume-driven organic revenue gains, supported by expansion of our preventative care programs. As noted, International reference lab growth was in the mid-single digit range supported by solid gains in Europe. ","Rapid assay revenues of $54 million grew 6% organically in Q1 reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume-driven supported by growth in 40x plus and first generation products.","Turning to the P&L. Operating profit in Q1 was $133 million, up 18% as reported, or 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins were 23.1%, up 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage.","Gross profit was $332 million in Q1, up 9% as reported or 12% on a constant-currency basis. Gross margins increased to 110 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by continued moderate CAG Diagnostic net price gains, volume leverage and productivity gains and our U.S. reference lab business, mix benefits from high consumable growth as well as solid gross margin improvement in our Water and LPD businesses. ","Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit were $1.4 million in Q1. Operating expenses in Q1 were up 4% or 7% on a constant-currency basis, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in CAG, sales and marketing and R&D spending with overall spending increases mitigated by modest constant-currency growth and G&A cost, including benefits from later phasing and certain IT-related projects. ","EPS in Q1 was $1.17 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2018 and 2019 decreased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share. Our effective tax rate was 17.7% in Q1, including benefits of 4.4% to our tax rate or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.02 per share higher than projected. ","Free cash flow was minus $4 million for Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality and increased capital spending related to major projects. We continue to maintain our full year outlook for free cash flow of approximately 60% to 65% of net income for 2019 and a $160 million to $170 million in capital spending, which includes approximately 20% of free cash flow impact, driven by $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German Core Lab relocation. ","We allocated $54 million in capital for repurchases of 267,000 shares in Q1. We ended Q1 with $1,052 billion in debt, including $100 million of the new tenure notes issued in the quarter. Our liquidity remains strong with a $117 million in cash and $502 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.69 times gross and 1.5 times net of cash and investment balances.","We\u2019re maintaining our 2019 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We\u2019re now projecting annual interest expense, net interest expense of $36 million incorporating a more favorable full year interest rate outlook.","Turning to our 2019 guidance, we\u2019re reinforcing our full year revenue outlook, while raising our EPS range by $0.10 per share. Our full year reported revenue guidance remains $2,385 million to $2,425 million, reflecting consistent expectations for 9.5% to 11% overall organic growth and 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues.","Our reported revenue Outlook reflects a consistent projected 1.5% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release. We\u2019re raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance, $0.10 per share to $4.76 to $4.88 or 16% and 19% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This incorporates a 30 basis point increase in our outlook for constant currency operating margin improvement now estimated at 80 to 110 basis points for the full year, resulting in approximately 7% \u2013 $0.07 per share in improvement in our EPS guidance range.","We\u2019ve also refined our outlook for net interest expense and stock compensation tax benefits, which combined at approximately 3% to our full year EPS \u2013 $0.03 to our full year EPS range. We\u2019ve updated our outlook for 2019 effective tax rate to 20% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $8.5 million to $10.5 million or approximately 2% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. We estimate that foreign exchange rate gains will decrease reported EPS by $0.03 per year, net of approximately $11 million in projected hedge gains.","For the second quarter, we expect reported revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% and organic revenue gains of 9% to 10.5% supported by consistent 11% to 12% CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We expect Q2 operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points higher than prior year levels on a constant currency basis. This outlook incorporates the re-phasing of plan for staff investments, impacts of higher international commercial staffing levels and incremental investments in select areas including increases to our U.S. VetLab capacity. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 21.5%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity.","That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments.","Jon Ayers","Thank you, Brian. Now a little color commentary. We had a strong start in 2019 in the first quarter with organic revenue growth of 10% and comparable constant currency EPS gains of 27% supported by better than expected margin gains. Globally, we delivered a solid 12% organic growth in our CAG diagnostic recurring revenues at the higher end of our full year growth rate with strong gains across the U.S. and international regions. This expanding highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXX\u2019s total revenues in Q1.","Instrument placements globally considering both quality and quantity together, we\u2019re solid with strength in the U.S., Europe and Latin America offset by year-over-year declines in Asia Pacific, primarily related to tough comparisons. Our premium install base continues to expand at high rates and we do not see any change in the competitive environment.","In Q1, our U.S. field organization was in the second quarter of the latest territory expansion. And so we saw strong momentum in placements of catalysts in new and competitive accounts up 7% as our field organization expires customers to trade up to IDEXX\u2019s advanced technology offering. We also had an exceptional quarter with SNAP Pro placements of almost 2,000, driven by the U.S. up 68% year-over-year.","We are methodically transforming our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model. As a SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. And we\u2019re seeing higher growth and rapid assay loyalty when customers adopt SNAP Pro workflow. With placements in Q1, we\u2019re now well over 60% of our SNAP 4Dx coming from active and connective SNAP Pro customers.","Despite tough comparisons to high prior year SediVue placements, new and competitive catalysts and SNAP Pro gave supported solid growth in the U.S. economic value index in the quarter. They really did a great job.","Europe also saw strong \u2013 solid Q1 growth in catalyst placements and instrument placement value, which is impressive given they are in their first quarter of the field sales expansions. The European expansions are on their way to completion at 92% occupancy. However, 40% of field reps are in their first year. And as a result, sales productivity in Europe will be building through 2019 as field experience and time and territory advances.","This is the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. when we undertook a similar major expansion in 2015. The U.S. Companion Animal market is on very solid footing as is the pet owner in general based on macro and the trends we see. We are excited to be presenting this quarter a much expanded and improved market growth reporting as shown on the second page of our earnings snapshot with an upgrade to our methodology and an expansion in the number of practice of 7,500 in total coming from a variety of both IDEXX and third-party Practice Management System.","Additionally, weighted to reflect the market in terms of geography and practice size and type with the support of Animalytix and we\u2019re grateful for their partnership. We\u2019re giving back to the industry by publishing these important metrics on a quarterly basis, as part of our earnings. This is an industry with otherwise limited to no market data of this kind. Of course, the data also helps investors understand IDEXX a little bit better.","From this data, we\u2019re seeing 2.2% clinical visit growth from existing practices in Q1 to get to total market visit growth, we need to add the impact of net new practice formation, which we estimate to be about 1%. Pet care in the U.S. is a very healthy market with existing veterinary practices making investments in technology and infrastructure and new practices being opened.","Our growth of the Companion Group diagnostics recurring revenue in the U.S. was 11% in Q1, net of about 1% equivalent day headwind. We are and have been growing faster, our diagnostic volume than patient visit growth for several reasons. First, we\u2019re seeing same \u2013 strong same-store sales in diagnostic volume growth beyond clinical visit growth, driven by our unique innovations and our focus on driving ongoing increases in the utilization diagnostics and pet care.","Across our modalities, we estimate this adds about 4% of incremental volume to clinical visit growth. To this, you add another 2% growth in the number of new practices that are utilizing IDEXX as their primary diagnostic partner, whether it be in-house, reference lab or both, call this customer share gain, if you will.","In fact, we topped 20,000 practices sending at least one sample at the IDEXX reference labs and Q1, our record for this metric in Q1. We also continue to realize 2% to 3% net price realization in Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue. So added all up 9% volume growth from a variety of sources and 2% to 3% new price realization gets us to low teens Dx recurring revenue in the U.S. aligned with the high end of our long-term U.S. growth potential of 9% to 13%.","Same-store sales at the practice level is being driven in part by the adoption of IDEXX\u2019s fecal offering and by preventative care diagnostics, what we call the Preventative Care Challenge or PCC. To-date, through Q1, nearly 2,800 practices have enrolled in PCC program since its inception with over 300 new practices enrolled in the quarter. These 2,800 practices are growing IDEXX diagnostics at just under 15% on a trailing 12-month basis.","Preventative care is a great example of how we are creating new market growth with our innovations incorporated into reference lab PCC profiles, all of which include at a minimum IDEXX SDMA with the chemistry, the IDEXX CBC, fecal antigen and IDEXX\u2019s 4Dx offering. Together, they make an IDEXX PCC panel, a well justified annual pet owner investment in their pet \u2013 in the pet\u2019s health by uncovering underlying disease as part of a wellness visit. Just think it this way.","Running a PCC panel on a pet as part of an annual physical exam is like a human getting a physical with blood work every seven years. The only difference is that the blood work is even more important in pet care as the pet can\u2019t speak for themselves. And we\u2019ve got these dogs running around dog parks sniffing around and drinking from the puddles.","It\u2019s just a different situation and we\u2019re finding there\u2019s a lot of value. When a veterinary practice partners with IDEXX, with our proprietary PCC panels, their overall practice revenue growth accelerates generally without the addition of any staff. Clearly, 2019 is the year where preventative care diagnostics driven by the expanded capabilities of IDEXX\u2019s unique offering is moving into the mainstream of veterinary medicine to the benefit of the veterinary practice, pets, owners and IDEXX\u2019s alike.","And yet, we believe IDEXX is only serving 10% of the total addressable market for preventative care. We also see nice same-store sales growth in the VetLab consumables business from the adoption of new menu, including catalysts SDMA, SediVue and now catalyst progesterone. Customer retention rates in the U.S. remain stable and Q1 at world-class levels of 98% to 99%.","In an environment where our competitors use they\u2019re only weapon price to compete, it\u2019s nice to see our customers do not equate price with the value and evidence the value of our innovations through their loyalty. New Product launches in the quarter included catalysts progesterone, which is off to a strong start, both U.S. and internationally.","France led the launch helping to expand the availability of poodles. We completed the update of all SediVue in the field with the newest algorithm, Neural Network 4.0 benefit of our internet of things strategy with our instruments. And veterinary software \u2013 in the veterinary software portfolio, we released Cornerstone 9.1 to great excitement and rave reviews. This new release brings a transformed user experience that is more intuitive and reduces clicks and we\u2019re seeing a more rapid take up of this new release as a result.","We had strong placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and Smart Flow systems in the quarter. In addition, this month we formally announced the prospective availability of a cloud version of Cornerstone, for our customers who value the deep and unique functionality of Cornerstone as the go-to, high end practice management software, but also want the benefits of the cloud, such as full mobile access. We\u2019re seeing strong adoption in our IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud-based software-as-a-service offering with its new reference image library and the ability to work with both IDEXX digital imaging systems as well as those from third parties.","Total Web PACS subscriptions have seen a 40% growth year-over-year, other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including Petly Plans for wellness plans enterprise to support our corporate customers and of course, IDEXX VetConnectPLUS, which continues to make steady advancement in both functionality utilization.","It is indeed a comprehensive and impressive IDEXX software technology stack. We\u2019re serving a growth market and supporting further market growth through our advanced diagnostics and software technologies. Given our success, we have in the works augmented and investments planned in the North American market, including reference lab capacity expansion, corporate account support resources, and further investments in our customer facing software strategies.","Of no \u2013 we have no plans for further expansion of our field based footprint in the U.S. or internationally in 2019, in diagnostics other than completing the orchids, the occupancy plans in Europe, and a small expansion to serve corporate accounts. With these investments, we\u2019re focusing on the remainder of 2019 on driving field sales productivity, which comes from time and territory advancing our CRM and advancing programs such as EVI and IDEXX 360.","In summary, we see very solid trends in our markets globally in 2019 and remain on track to advance our strategy of investments to further our innovation agenda, such as our outlook for about $150 million in cash R&D. While delivering our \u2013 on our 2019 revenue goals and an augmented outlook of 16% to 19% comparable constant currency EPS gains for the year.","And Kevin, with that, I\u2019ll open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Please go ahead. ","Ryan Daniels","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and all the detail. Brian, one for you. Operating margins clearly stronger than anticipated. And I think you mentioned in your comments, there were some IT and maybe R&D spending that was delayed. So can you dive into a little bit more the rationale behind that? Was it related to personnel hiring, given the economy or just the noise in investment spending? And then number two, anything we need to think about regarding cadence in those items for the rest of the year on a quarterly basis. ","Brian McKeon","Thanks, Ryan. On the project spending, it was just a normal executional timing. It wasn\u2019t a change in plans, but just when we were able to execute some of the IT and R&D project spends. We\u2019re still on track as Jon highlighted for the cash R&D spending goals this year, which are about a 15% increase. And so that will face in relatively more through Q2 through Q4. And we\u2019ll also continue to execute in the IT front. So it was more just a timing versus our estimates. ","I would highlight that in Q1, we had some favorability that benefited the quarter. We had some favorable compares in our LPD business on the gross margin line. We had very strong consumable growth in particularly in international, some of that benefited we highlighted there was some Brexit pull forward. That added a couple of points to growth and we\u2019ve got some mix benefits from those factors. ","And as we work through the years, we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ll have some incremental investments going coming online in the second quarter will be adding some day lab capacity in the U.S., and that\u2019s factored into our margin outlook balance of the year. So we are clearly feeling good about how the year started. We raised the full year operating margin goal, but I think some of those factors will moderate the gains as we work through the year.","Ryan Daniels","Okay, very helpful color. And then Jon, my follow-up will be for you in regards to the international sales force. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019ve seen in regards to their ramp relative to the United States? I know you said 40% are within that first year. So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a nice ramp curve and maybe there\u2019s confounding factors like moving to IDEXX 360 and some of the other initiatives that make a little hard to gauge versus historical levels. But what would you anticipate in regards to the productivity of that salesforce is it both expands and matures?","Jon Ayers","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good question. I think it\u2019s going to international expansions that they will \u2013 we will see the productivity build over the course of your. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a phenomenal product line and we\u2019ve demonstrated that with placements around the world. And it just gets better as we add to it with things like with progesterone and of course, the regular software updates that go to all of our instruments as part of our smart service strategy.","But its \u2013 the sales expansion, so I would see this was a very major expansion. And we undertook over the last four months to six months, yes, internationally in selected markets. Obviously we had a very strong, we have very strong country organizations there already. But I would say this expansion was kind of more \u2013 for them, was more in the order of expansion that we undertook in 2015 in the U.S. and so I would use that as a guide, how we think things will progress over the year.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. You highlighted again in the prepared remarks around the preventative care challenge program, and can you give us a sense on when that will contribute more to financials, if there\u2019s anything embedded in your guidance for 2019? Or if there\u2019s any other metrics, I think you gave some in your prepared remarks that we can track on a quarterly basis just to measure the success and progress of your efforts on the preventative care front? Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Thank you. We \u2013 that\u2019s a great question. That is contributing to the 11% reported growth in the U.S. recurring revenue, which had a day of headwind in it. So that that\u2019s \u2013 that is a \u2013 the preventive care is a big deal. And the evidence, the medical evidence for preventative care is getting stronger and stronger as we put together that the data and we share it with the industries and the key opinion leaders. And our field organization, I mean this is one of the reasons why we\u2019ve done all of these expansions. They are bringing it to the local practice. ","So we\u2019re adding every quarter a couple of hundred practices who are moving to this new way of thinking. They\u2019re all being threatened by the retail going out of the practice. And so they\u2019re realizing that is a turned to diagnostics, that\u2019s not only a nice anecdote, but it\u2019s a higher, it\u2019s a more productive, it\u2019s higher, so more satisfying and financially impactful way to grow the practice. Then retail, it has higher margins. And it\u2019s a whole lot more satisfying to address issues early then that deal with them very late in their progression with the pet. ","And so I think we\u2019re beginning to see significant momentum of 2,800 practices. That\u2019s approaching 10% of the market. That is not a insubstantial demonstration of the success of this program. And yet, of course, we\u2019re really only early days. We think every practice really should be adopting this as a best practice over time. They\u2019ve got the tools and the support of our field organization to do so.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then you gave some great data points on the underlying market demand trends in the U.S. I\u2019m curious if you keep track of some of those metrics overseas in terms of same-store sales volume trends. And if so, kind of directionally here how we should be thinking about the underlying health of the international CAG market. Are you seeing a broader presence from competitors that can also help drive awareness and advanced practice protocols in Europe as well as more broadly internationally? Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Yes, thank you. We\u2019re really pleased to be able to present in partnership with Animalytix, the much more sophisticated U.S. metrics. And as we all know, there\u2019s just like almost no data in this industry and there are reasons for that. It\u2019s because, it\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the standardization we see in human healthcare. In practice management systems, we found 790 different ways to call a dog, a dog. It\u2019s pretty amazing. ","So our machine learning AI is really coming into play here. With regard to the comparison to international, we just, we aren\u2019t there yet. We don\u2019t have that that same capability. But generally speaking, they\u2019re the same pets and people love their pets. And the level of adoption of diagnostics is still a fraction. And so we\u2019re bringing intention, but certainly any intention that the industry brings to the profession of the value of diagnostics we think will help grow the market around the world.","And clearly we\u2019re seeing that with the double-digit growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues that we\u2019re seeing routinely outside the U.S. somewhere to the more advanced market that we have in the U.S. And it\u2019s really not \u2013 it\u2019s really a phenomenon and the cuts across all cultures and geographies. And really it\u2019s the amount of the attention that we can bring support of course, by a great product line that\u2019s going to drive this growth, which is why we\u2019ve done these expansions internationally to accelerate the adoption of diagnostics in the practice of veterinary medicine.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question from the line of Michael Ryskin by Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Michael Ryskin ","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A few quick ones, just to follow-up on some of the things you highlighted earlier. You mentioned some stocking in the UK tied up with the Brexit, I think you said 2% to international consumables growth. So I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s about 65 to 70 bps to total consumables in the quarter. So make sure that\u2019s correct and sort of, what\u2019s your expectation for that throughout the rest of the years, that belief that that\u2019s going to fade or sort of reverse in 2Q or if you could just tell us how that factors into your outlook.","Jon Ayers","That is correct. The number was 2% international\u2026","Michael Ryskin ","International consumable, that\u2019s exactly correct.","Jon Ayers","And that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re weighted towards the U.S. and consumables relatively. but I think that\u2019s \u2013 those are reasonable estimates on the overall effect. And we\u2019ll see, we don\u2019t have full insight into how the many customers, we have an international markets are that you take\u2026","Michael Ryskin ","Correct, perhaps it will evolve.","Jon Ayers","Exactly. But we were anticipating there was a high level of concern obviously, with the uncertainty in Q1 and we\u2019d anticipate some pullback in Q2, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll see how that plays out. We don\u2019t have full visibility into that at this point.","Michael Ryskin ","Okay, thanks. And then another quick one, on the instrument revenues, I think you mentioned sort of the disconnect, where revenues were down I think 3% organically, but you saw a pretty solid placements across the board. You mentioned some mix in terms of a tough comp onset of you year-over-year, and how that played into the dynamic, but I was wondering \u2013 and then you could say sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, how\u2019s pricing and instruments you mentioned? I think it was positive for the CAG overall, but I want to focus on what\u2019s going on in the capital equipment side of things?","Jon Ayers","Yes. I would say it\u2019s similar \u2013 similar dynamics. We had different metrics we can look at on that front. But I think the amount of cash that we put out for, in support of instrument placement programs on a quarterly basis was kind of in line with the trend we had last year. We did have a couple of tough compares in the quarter, set of view, we had an exceptional year last year and we had very strong placements in Q4 and our organization was really focusing Q1 on the big new \u2013 the competitive placement opportunities, which you saw on the quality of the numbers that we posted there.","So that was one factor. Another one that we\u2019ll see going into the second quarter as well as we had very strong vet crit test upgrade results in international markets including China last year. And so just on an absolute revenue basis, we\u2019re up against tough for compares, but net-net, we\u2019re shifting a lot of our focus towards the competitive placements and that\u2019s helping us on the EBI front.","So, we feel very good about the quality of the growth and just to reinforce, we pointed out that year-on-year, we\u2019ve got a 24% increase in our Catalyst installed base globally. So, that\u2019s the big driver of our consumable gains and we have great momentum there and we\u2019re feeling very good about that and that\u2019s where we\u2019re confident in reinforcing the outlook for the year.","Brian McKeon","Yes. And I just want to do a color commentary, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking that question that Mike and highlighting that. We really, we run the business on the economic value of the instrument placement, which of course, includes the pricing of the instrument and the instrument revenues, but also includes our estimate of the economic value of the annuity, associated with that placement. ","And so we don\u2019t run it based on instrument revenues. So that would be the wrong way to think about the business. It\u2019s about creating value with each quarter. And it was a very solid and positive growth in the value of those placements, and it was really, to put it in one word, it was really mixed up that has the revenues a little bit different than the value.","Michael Ryskin ","Very helpful. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with gross margins, they were up real strong at 120 bps. I haven\u2019t seen sort of that level, I don\u2019t believe of year-over-year gross margin expansion since the first half of 2017. But Brian, some of that expansion was from the other businesses. You called it out in bid, but Water and LPD gross margins were up around 400 bps to 500 bps year-over-year. So, if you can talk to what drove that and is that step function to the new level largely sustainable in those divisions going forward?","Brian McKeon","I think it is, yes. We should have continued good gross margin performance across the different businesses. I would highlight some factors that are benefiting us in Q1 in LPD. We did a very strong health herd screening, revenues which are relatively higher margin in that business. And that is that \u2013 we don\u2019t anticipate that same level of growth as we\u2019re moving forward and some of that was a compare. We had some higher costs last year as well. So, I think it\u2019s a \u2013 the year-over-year growth, Jon, we anticipate some moderation in that dynamic, but I think we\u2019re confident that we can sustain a good margin performance we\u2019ve had in the business.","And water continues to be a very healthy business for us. And I think we\u2019re \u2013 we hope to build on that. I \u2013 we are obviously expecting this year gross margin to be a key driver of our overall performance. The 80 basis points to 110 basis points improvement and we expected the bulk of that to be delivering by gross margins, but there will be some moderation as we as we move forward including in the next quarter just as we advanced some of the investments that we talked about and we have some of the mixed dynamics changing as well. But we think, we\u2019ve captured that in our full-year outlook.","Jon Ayers ","Just one more thing Jon, I really \u2013 I want to call out, I was very pleased \u2013 that we\u2019re very pleased with the reference lab, a gross margin performance in the herd. And as you know that the U.S. has really been very well with the double-digit growth that is higher than our global 11% in the reference lab organically. It\u2019s really being led by the U.S., it\u2019s very, very successful part of our strategy. We\u2019re seeing nice gross margin growth there. Of course, we\u2019re reinvesting some of that for expanded capacity to really continue to provide an exceptional service level across all geographies in the U.S. and we\u2019ve called that out as an incremental investment in balance of the year.","Jon Block","Got it, very helpful. And just a pivot to my second one here, I didn\u2019t find the instrument figures to surprising. And as you mentioned, clearly where these boxes go dictate the future annuity, but the set of you down 26% year-over-year on a global basis was a surprise to me. I believe the in clinic urine sediment might be around 15% penetrated in the U.S. give or take. So Jon, you know, a couple of years into the U.S. SediVue launch. How do you view the peak penetration rate of in-clinic urine sediment, and put it in perspective of hematology and chemistry, which might be closer to 70% and 90%, respectively. Thanks guys.","Jon Ayers","Yes, thank you. First of all, the SediVue to-date has mostly been a North American product area and it\u2019s been driven by North America. And we continue to see that, that could be in the case in the near future. Our North American organization, particularly, our U.S. organization, it just had a very strong quarter in competitive catalysts, okay. Those are \u2013 they have that lot \u2013 adds a lot of economic value. Those are in some ways more challenging than even SediVue. And so we have the remaining SediVue opportunity in front of us that we\u2019ve talked about, probably over 30,000 analyzers, when we compare what SediVue penetration could be in relation to chemistry and hematology. I think we\u2019ve laid those numbers out in conversation with investors in the past.","And so really there\u2019s no \u2013 we don\u2019t really see any change in the ultimate opportunity for SediVue penetration. And we really, really remain a class by our own with regard to SediVue and keeps getting better, that the Neural Network 4.0, which just is silent upgrade that went across our entire installed base, but a new menu and a greater overall experience. And we\u2019re not done yet with continued software investments in SediVue. And our customers know SediVue just gets better and better. So I think, it was a quarter where the field worked on the competitive catalyst placements. And I got to tell you, I was pretty proud of our accomplishments in that regard.","Also, Jon, one more thing. I know you\u2019ve talked about it in the past. You got to be impressed with that 68% year-over-year growth in SNAP Pro placements. I mean, that\u2019s really turning out to be a great strategy. And of course, that\u2019s also takes a field effort to accomplish.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mark Massaro","Hey guys, thanks for the questions and congratulations to your team for putting together this really large dataset. I wanted to ask if you could maybe help me, think of where the additional 2,500 practices of data came from. I think, you reported out 5,000 previously. And then this is probably nitpicking, but last quarter I think you called, 30 basis points of increase and it looks like you revised that down to 30 basis points of decrease. Is that largely a function and I\u2019m referring to Q4 total visit growth. Is that largely a function of the additional practice data? Or was there were something else revised like geographic location changes.","Jon Ayers","Yes. Let me first \u2013 take the first part of your question, and then Brian can answer the second part. So the 7,500 practices includes, while the 5,000 always included practices beyond our Cornerstone, which is go to PIMs. We\u2019ve greatly expanded the number of practices across the five major practice information management systems that are out there, only some of which are ours and some of which are third-party. And in addition, not only that, we haven\u2019t just taken a straight growth, we\u2019ve weighted the growth across these practice by segmenting them and getting them proportionally represented to the market, in terms of geography. We may have more in one geography than another, but we\u2019ve adjusted for that. And it\u2019s really been with a supportive Animalytix that we\u2019ve been able to do that weighting.","So really it is a comprehensive revamp and we\u2019ve been able to apply our machine learning algorithms to figure out what are the clinical visits versus what I would call maybe the retail or non-clinical service visits, such as boarding and grooming, which of course, these are the higher quality visits and they\u2019re the ones that have a diagnostics and prescribed medications, so veterinary services that involved the veterinarian. So these are the more important \u2013 and they get more important business, so they give greater visibility. So I think long-term trends. Brian, you want to\u2026","Brian McKeon","Yes. And the \u2013 to Jon\u2019s point, we\u2019ve refine the methodologies and to make this even more accurate and just went back in time and adjusted the prior data to be consistent with that. So you\u2019ll see some minor changes in the historical data, but it\u2019s all intended to be apples.","Jon Ayers","I think we look at this practice visit growth at the clinical level, not including net new practice formation, which we do not capture in this information, because we\u2019re looking at same-store sales year-over-year. I think, we see a very robust market. I would generalize, stepping apart from the quarter as a whole, I think we\u2019re seeing in same-store sales 2.5% to approaching 3% on a sustainable basis, practice visit growth on a same-store sales basis. And as we said, we had estimated that about 1% of that.","Brian McKeon","So I think it\u2019s very healthy market and it\u2019s nice to see the first quarter. It does bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but I was nice to see the first quarter metrics.","Mark Massaro","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then as more and more animal clinics choose to join larger groups, the value of these contracts become increasingly important. Can you just speak to, how you feel you\u2019re positioned as \u2013 maybe some of your competitors may have won some large deals, whether it\u2019s three or four years ago, some of these might be up for renewal. Can you just speak to the opportunities, in front of you and how you think your positions going forward?","Jon Ayers","Thank you. We think we\u2019re exceptionally well positioned and we have very high loyalty among our corporate practices. Our corporate practices value us for a couple of reasons. First of all, we helped them drive same-store sales growth, which just has a very nice drop through benefit in a practice that has high fixed cost leverage. Diagnostics is a great place to improve both the revenue and the profitability. And our field reps along with our technologies such as preventative care and the underlying diagnostic technologies and better than preventative care drive same \u2013 help them drive same-store sales growth. Second, the number one issue that corporate practices had his staff engagement and retention. It\u2019s hard to recruit in the current environment. And the staff likes our products and they\u2019re very loyal to our products and they \u2013 and our corporate practices appreciate on that.","And so they really want to be able to support the local staff with the best technology. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have such high loyalty, because they acquire practices with our products and they keep them. And if they decide to take them out that really usually has a pretty negative impact on engagement, which can lead to issues on staff retention, which of course has a pretty dramatic impact on the economics of that practice. So you lose a key producer and you\u2019ve got to go find someone that\u2019s not a pleasant experience.","So our model works in the corporate and you can see it in our recurring revenue growth even in the period of the slow evolution of the industry to a larger corporate sector. Our recurring revenue growth is quite strong in that regard and those loyalty factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks of 98% to 99%. That\u2019s all in, that\u2019s individual and corporate all embedded.","Mark Massaro","Great. And if I can sneak one last one in, you performed more or less strong across the board and kind of in line with consensus for Q1. On the reference lab segment, you are going up against tough comps from the first half of last year. And I think we\u2019ve kind of saw the growth rate sort of moderate based on the comp. But in particular on OUS, came in at mid single digits. How should we think about the underlying demand of OUS reference lab? And can you speak to whether or not this might change when the Germany eat reference lab opens?","Jon Ayers","All right. We are on track with opening the new core lab in Germany, which will really replace existing lab in Q1 of 2020. I think your comments are correct with regard to first half and second half for a comparison on the international reference lab. I think it\u2019s all part of that growing the highest and most productive use of these reps is placing instruments, because that\u2019s got very, very \u2013 that\u2019s a very, very profitable business for us. But of course, we are growing our labs too. And so it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s putting all that together, there\u2019s some time experience to pull that off. And so we\u2019ve got moderated expectations on the reference lab impact of the expansion in relation to what we hope to achieve with regard to instrument placements.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Andrew Cooper of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Andrew Cooper","Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Just a couple for me. Kind of to the point that I think Jon was asking about, when we think about the margin dynamics that, that we saw in 1Q and then the increase in the guide. It looks like these relative to what we had modeled really the bulk of the outperformance is in one queue. And there\u2019s not a whole lot of change in the rest of the year. So just any color you could provide on sort of how some of that fell versus your expectations and how much is \u2013 to his question, a sustainable step up in the gross margins as opposed to a little bit more of a one-off in the first quarter.","Brian McKeon","We did see more benefit than we anticipated. And some of it we tried to highlight here. I think the broader theme is we\u2019re on track, we\u2019re reinforcing the four year outlook, we\u2019re flowing that through. And maintaining our outlook while we\u2019re advancing some investments that we didn\u2019t have for outlook. So I think it was number of things moved in a good direction in Q1 and we are talk to what their full year goals and it\u2019s all aligned with the long-term goals we have for operating margin improvement. But I think you\u2019re right. There were some upside there that we\u2019re not projecting out in the balance of the year.","Jon Ayers","This is \u2013 generally speaking, this is an amazing business with very, very high ROIC. It\u2019s an investible business. And so we are continuing to invest for sustained long-term growth in the profitable and enduring recurring revenue. So we look our plans, of course, extend way beyond the year 2019. And it was really factored into what we shared with you as our outlook for the year is the maximizing the growth and the value to our customers and our investors over a five year or five year plus timeframe.","Andrew Cooper","That\u2019s helpful. I guess, is there anyway you can sort of help size, did \u2013 were you to not make those incremental step-ups that you\u2019ve kind of layered in with this update. What you think the margin profile might\u2019ve looked like otherwise?","Jon Ayers","It\u2019s relatively small differences. We haven\u2019t broken that up, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to highlight that we\u2019re advancing some additional investments and that\u2019s factored into the guide.","Andrew Cooper","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my last one would just be sort of higher level and again, along the lines that, I think Erin asked about, in terms of international and sort of how we think about the growth there. You\u2019ve seen really strong same-store growth like you talked about in the U.S. Has that pace in terms of same-store been consistent internationally or faster. Or is there \u2013 not too much, but much more of a focus on kind of the new accounts and not as much on the same-store kind of drivers. So you think there\u2019s lot more opportunity there, but it maybe hasn\u2019t kept up with the U.S. or any color on that would be great.","Jon Ayers","Well, what I will say is, and thank you for that question. I think we are driving growth through new instrument placements. We do see a nice \u2013 you don\u2019t get to double-digit recurring revenue growth without both the new customer and store and dynamic and some modest price realization. But, we don\u2019t yet really have an appropriate focus on preventative care outside of North America yet, simply because I think it just test the sick pets, we would be a lot higher utilization than we have today. ","So we\u2019re just convincing them to add diagnostics as part of the sick pet visit, which is obviously outside the U.S. with an overall lower standards, a higher proportion of total practice visits. And yet the preventative \u2013 there\u2019s no reason that preventative care couldn\u2019t be an opportunity broadly speaking outside the U.S. we have it, we have started very, very selective markets, but it\u2019s a relatively small thing and something I talked about last quarter, but it is ahead of us.","At some point we will turn to preventative care globally, because we have great proprietary platform in that regard. And the sales organization and the diagnostic modalities to pull that off. It\u2019s just not quite ready for the opportunities internationally are where we\u2019re taking advantage of them today with the new instrument placements and utilization growth and sick animal testing.","Jon Ayers","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question is from the line of Michael Ryskin. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Ryskin","Question has been answered. Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Okay, great. Thank you all. With that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I want to, again, thank our employees for the phenomenal progress and the performance in Q1 and advancement of our technology and commercial strategies around the world. And also, I\u2019m grateful for the attention the confidence that our investors have in the IDEXX business model. So with that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you very much for calling in.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining.

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2017.","We had very strong results in Q4 which concluded a year of exceptional financial performance for IDEXX in 2016. We achieved 12% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter supported by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong gains in premium instrument placements supported by the expansion of SediVue, which contributed about 2% to overall revenue growth.","Our full-year organic revenue growth was 11.4%, about 3% above our original 2016 growth goal entering the year. These results were supported by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting strong double-digit growth in both US and International markets.","Our full-year EPS was $2.44 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting strong topline results and operating margin gains. In 2016 we achieved a 19.7% operating margin, a 170 basis point increase on an adjusted constant currency basis, reflecting solid gross margin gains and significant operating expense leverage. EPS grew 25% on an adjusted constant currency basis in 2016, well above our long-term financial goals. Our operating trends position us well to deliver strong constant currency revenue and EPS growth in 2017 consistent with our long-term goals. We'll provide an update on our 2017 guidance later in the call.","Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results beginning with an overview of regional performance. We achieved strong organic growth in US and International regions in the fourth quarter driven by continued momentum in expanding our Companion Animal business. US revenues were $268 million in the quarter, up 12% organically. Gains were driven by continued strong premium instrument placements and 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting our strongest quarterly US growth performance in 2016 in this important annuity revenue stream. US recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs, accelerated double-digit consumable gains and solid growth in rapid assay sales.","US CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range with the bulk of our growth driven by volume. IDEXX's performance significantly outpaced solid US veterinary practice market growth in Q4, reflected in our data set from \u2013 about 5,200 clinics. In Q4 patient visits increased 1.4% and clinic revenues increased 5.6% compared to the prior year period, somewhat similar to Q2 and Q3 market growth trends.","For the full year, US revenues reached $1.09 billion driven by over $1 billion in US CAG revenues, a significant milestone for the company. We achieved US organic growth of 11% in 2016 driven by an increase of 11% in US CAG, supported by 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and strong growth in premium instrument placements.","Instrument revenues in Q4 were $175 million up 11% organically. International results were driven by 16% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting continued strong consumable gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base.","International revenues reached $686 million for the full-year or 39% of total IDEXX revenues reflecting organic gains of 12%. For the full-year international CAG revenues reached $506 million up 16% organically.","International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues also increase 16% organically for the year reflecting strong double-digit growth across Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Overall international gains were moderated by modest growth in our international LPD business.","Turning to segment performance our Q4 results benefited from strong premium instrument placements reflecting global expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and continued strong momentum with SediVue.","Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were at $35 million, up 24% organically supported by 15% growth in premium instrument placements. Globally we've placed 1,493 catalysts, 1,128 premium hematology analyzers, and 546 SediVues in the first quarter.","Catalyst and premium hematology placements were down modestly compared to very strong prior-year levels which included benefits from nearly 200 second Catalyst placements in the U.S. related to our successful customer retention programs.","In North America we have placed 524 Catalysts in Q4 with 347 or 66% at competitive or greenfield accounts consistent with our commercial focus. Catalyst retention rates remain very high at 98%.","The U.S. Catalyst consumable revenue now represents 98% of total chemistry consumable revenues excluding corporate accounts. International instrument placement performance continues to be very strong reflected in 1,783 premium instrument placements including our initial placements of SediVue in the U.K. and Australia.","For the full-year, we placed 5,198 Catalysts, 3,699 premium hematology analyzers, and 1,575 SediVues globally; nearly 10,500 premium instrument placements in total representing growth of 21%.","Strong instrument placement trends supported continued global expansion of our instrument base. We ended 2016 with an active install base of 24,500 Catalysts. Our install Catalyst instrument base increased 23% globally in 2016 supported by 11% year-on-year growth in the U.S. and 40% gains in international markets. In fact our international Catalyst base is now nearly as large as our U.S. Catalyst base.","Global expansion of our premium instrument base sets the foundation for continued strong gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q4 global CAG Diagnostic revenues were $312 million up 13% organically. For the full year of 2016 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reached nearly $1.3 billion or 72% of total IDEXX revenue.","CAG recurring annuity growth reflected strong gains across modalities reflecting the multiplier effect of strong premium instrument placements, benefits from new test innovation and excellent execution by our global commercial organizations.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $141 million grew 13% organically in the fourth quarter supported by 13% organic gains in both U.S. and international markets.","Instrument consumable revenues of $115 million in Q4 grew 18% organically supported by continued very strong gains in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. including building benefits from the expansion of SediVue.","Rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q4 to $42 million supported by continued solid gains in SNAP 4Dx and stabilized volume trends in first-generation products.","Livestock poultry and dairy revenue of $33 million declined modestly in Q4, as solid gains in recurring revenues supported by emerging-market expansion and growth of our pregnancy platform were offset by declines in bovine disease eradication testing in Europe and lower health herd screening revenues.","For the full-year our LPD revenues were $126 million, up 1% organically. For 2017, we are planning for flat to modest growth in LPD overall as we continue to work through pressures from year-on-year comparisons in these select product lines.","Our water business revenues grew 3% organically in the fourth quarter. As expected we saw moderation in our Q4 growth reflecting impacts from channel inventory adjustments in advance of a go-direct initiative in Brazil as well as lapping of strong prior-year sales associated with the launch of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product and the crypto outbreak in the U.K.","For the full-year water business revenues increased $104 million, up 9% organically. We're very pleased with our momentum in the water business and we believe we're on track for continued high single digit organic revenue gains in this highly profitable business in 2017.","Turning to the P&L, gross profit was $241 million in Q4, up 11% on a reported basis. Adjusted for foreign exchange impacts including the lapping of $6 million in prior-year foreign exchange hedge gains gross margins increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid net price gains and volume leverage from strong consumable and reference lab growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $2 million in Q4. For the full-year 2016, foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million or a benefit of about $0.03 per share.","Operating profit in Q4 was $84 million, up 25% as reported reflecting an increase of 35% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains and operating expense leverage. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 3% driven by investment in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology. Q4 expense growth was lower than projected reflecting timing of select head count additions and benefits from favorable year-on-year accrual comparisons. For the full year operating profit was $350 million, this reflects an operating margin of 19.7% or an increase of 170 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 levels adjusted to exclude the prior year software impairment charge.","This very strong full-year result reflected about 40 basis points of constant currency gross margin gains and 130 basis points of benefits from operating expense leverage reflecting our strong topline performance and high returns from global sales and marketing investments.","EPS in Q4 was $0.58 per share. For 2016, adjusted EPS was $2.44 up 19% as reported and 25% on a comparable constant currency basis, adjusted to exclude the impacts from the 2015 software impairment charge.","For the full year foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by less than 1% and operating profit by $24 million primarily reflecting the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains. Combined with tax rate impacts, foreign exchange created a $0.20 per share headwind to full-year 2016 reported EPS results.","Free cash flow was $284 million for 2016 or 128% of net income. This very strong performance reflected benefits from strong working capital management including a $30 million reduction in inventory from relatively higher 2015 ending levels and improvements in DSO. We also benefited from controlled capital spending timing, including favorable impacts from timing of investments which resulted in full-year capital spending of $65 million or 3.7% of revenues.","Our cash flow performance in 2016 builds on strong long-term trends for the Company reflecting the strength of our business model and focus. Of note, over the last five years free cash flow has averaged 102% of net income including effects related to our transition to a fully direct commercial model in the U.S.","Our strong cash flows and continued positive business momentum supported allocation of $225 million in capital towards share repurchases in Q4. In the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares. This brought our full year repurchase levels to nearly 3.1 million shares reflecting a deployment of $313 million in 2016 at an average price of $102 per share.","We ended 2016 with $1.207 billion in debt outstanding. At year end, we had $392 million in cash and investment balances, and $238 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.","Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances at year end. We anticipate maintaining gross leverage ratios in the 2.5 times to 3.0 times range in 2017 with continued deployment of excess cash flow towards share repurchases.","Our solid finish to 2016 positions us well to deliver continued strong constant currency revenue and profit growth in 2017 consistent with our long-term goals. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're maintaining our outlook for 9% to 10.5% gains in 2017.","This results in consistent reported revenue guidance of $1.910 billion to $1.935 billion as benefits from strong final Q4 performance were offset by updated rate assumptions for foreign exchange which are reflected in our press release.","Overall, at the new assumed FX rates we project that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by 1.5% in 2017 related to the year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our strong revenue growth outlook is supported by expectations for 10.5% to 11.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues driven by double-digit gains in reference lab and consumable revenues and continued solid growth in rapid assay.","While we're targeting continued high level of premium instrument placements year-on-year growth in instrument revenues will moderate compared to very strong 2016 performance.","Today we're raising our 2017 EPS outlook to $2.85 to $3.01, an increase of $0.08 per share to reflect approximately $0.07 per share in flow-through benefits from strong 2016 operating profit performance and $0.04 of benefit from updated estimates related to the implementation of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. These positive factors offset about $0.03 of additional EPS headwind related to our updated FX estimates.","As noted in our last earnings call under the new accounting guidance, tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation which have been reflected in cash flows will be treated as a reduction in reported income taxes in the P&L going forward rather than as an equity adjustment.","In addition we will no longer assume that the tax benefit is used to repurchase shares in our diluted EPS calculation. Based on analysis of vesting stock option grants and historical exercise activity, we now estimate that implementation of this new guidance will increase 2017 EPS by $0.12 to $0.16 to per share. This reflects a projected reduction of 350 to 450 basis points in IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate offset by projected reduction in shares outstanding from estimated share repurchases of about 50 basis points.","Incorporating these new estimates our preliminary outlook for our 2017 effective tax rate is 26% to 27.5% assuming no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of about 1.5% net of the 0.5% accounting impact noted.","This is a relatively higher benefit than estimated in our preliminary guidance reflecting share repurchases in Q4. As noted we expect to maintain our gross leverage levels at 2.5 to 3 times EBITDA in 2017 resulting in projected net interest expense of $32 million to $33 million.","Foreign exchange impacts related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a variable impacting our financial performance in 2017. We've updated our financial outlook to reflect more recent exchange rates, which have weakened relative to dollars since we issued our preliminary guidance. At the updated exchange rates, outlined in our press release, we estimate that foreign exchange rates will reduce our reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2017 by about 1.5% and EPS by about $0.06 per share net of approximately $7 million in currently projected hedge gains.","We estimate that a 1% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies will result in a $7 million-change in 2017 revenue and a $2 million-change in 2017 operating profit net of hedges. Please note this sensitivity is on a full-year basis. Without the hedges the full year operating profit sensitivity would be about $3 million.","Adjusting for benefits from the new accounting guidance and foreign exchange impacts our EPS outlook is consistent with our long-term goals of 15% to 20% constant currency EPS growth. This outlook reflects a targeted 70 basis point year-on-year improvement in operating margins on a reported basis, net of modest headwinds associated with year-on-year FX changes. This is also consistent with our long-term target of 50 to 100 basis points of annual constant currency operating margin improvement.","Free cash flow is projected at about 95% of net income for 2017. Note that the implementation of the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation which raises reported net income but has no impact on cash flow will reduce this metric by about 5% going forward. So this equates to about 100% of net income under previous GAAP.","Our 2017 outlook reflects projected capital spending of $90 million. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 8.5% to 10% range reflecting organic gains of 10% to 11% offset by 1% to 1.5% of FX headwind. While we'll be facing some tougher growth comparisons related to a very strong prior-year first quarter which included benefits from leap year, we will be benefited from solid momentum heading into the year and expect to see year-on-year upside from SediVue instrument revenues in Q1. Recall that we didn't start shipping SediVues until last year's second quarter. Year-on-year operating margin in Q1 is expected to be about 50 basis points up compared to reported 2016 Q1 levels.","That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2017.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. It was indeed an exceptional Q4 completion to an exceptional 2016. Our strategy is all about enduring growth supported by a growing global market for pet healthcare combined with a combination of continuous improvement and continuously strengthening customer relationships. The year 2016 showed the potential we have with the strategy completing a year of 11.4% organic growth driven by 12% in organic growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which comprises of 72% of the Company's total revenue.","Of note Q4 for this recurring metric was a bit over 13% organically the highest growth for the four quarters of the year showing the momentum we are sustaining in the business model. We're seeing the benefits of world-class sales and marketing in our global markets coming on the heels of a series of investments we have made over the last several years to position ourselves with a direct presence in our markets.","Our International Companion Animal commercial organization had a phenomenal year in 2016. International Companion Animal Diagnostic recurring revenue grew 16% led by the over 20% growth in VetLab instrument consumables.","Clearly, our 2016 recurring revenue growth is benefiting from a strong number of Catalyst One placements for the past two years. And yet we're still early days for Catalyst One penetration internationally even as we embark on the SediVue launch in global markets. We launched SediVue in the U.K. and in Australia in Q4 2016, commencing an international launch that will roll out over the course of 2017.","Our Reference Labs also grew 13% organically internationally where we're seeing the benefits of SDMA and other investments in our global Reference Lab network. This solid volume led growth contributed also to the expansion of our global lab gross margins, a metric where we see opportunity for years to come.","Focusing on the U.S. companion animal market, we're also delivering impressive revenue growth. A combination of our new innovations and expanded presence with customers is not only growing our share of customers who use IDEXX as their diagnostic partner, but also the growing the market for diagnostics through increased customer utilization. Clearly with U.S. companion animal recurring revenue diagnostics showing full year growth in double-digits the strength of our fully direct model is proving out.","Looking back on 2016, our U.S. field sales and support organization made over 250,000 in-person visits with veterinary practices, or an average of approximately 10 visits for every practice in the U.S. This kind of frequency is what builds enduring trust and our ability to support practices growing utilization of our advanced diagnostics in providing high quality care. We also had very high occupancy rate in our veterinary diagnostic consultant territories, which is so important for consistent customer presence. This occupancy rate averaged 99.5% over the course of the year, world-class levels of territory occupancy.","Our research on U.S. customer satisfaction with IDEXX shows a strong trajectory in 2016 over prior years, further validated by an independent study of industry sales force effectiveness where IDEXX really stood out. In 2017, we plan to continue to augment and deepen our U.S. field sales and service presence, while at the same time achieving operating expense leverage. We can do both because of the rates of recurring revenue growth. We see the outcomes of our 2016 U.S. and Canadian sales coverage in a number of areas. Let me just list a few.","First, continued strong performance in placements and chemistry analyzers and new and competitive accounts nearly 1,200 for the full-year. Second, placements of over 1,500 SediVue instruments, an entirely new instrument launched in 2016 that generates a novel recurring revenue annuity. Third, an all-time record number of placements of digital radiography units in Q4. And speaking of digital radiography, we have reached almost 1,500 customer subscribers with our cloud-based digital software called IDEXX-PACS which is only one of five of our subscription-based SaaS offerings.","Loyalty and retention metrics across all CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue modalities improved every quarter in 2016. Low customer churn is one of the most important performance metrics for our recurring revenue model.","We also continue to grow our U.S. reference lab customer count or the number of practices that sent at least one sample to us during a six-month period. Two years ago before we started the journey to an expanded field sales organization that came with the U.S. fully direct implementation our customer count was about 58% of U.S. practices. And while this is an impressive level of penetration, it has since grown to 65% at the end of 2016.","Clearly our strategy of covering the market with dedicated veterinary diagnostic consultants and offering expanded and unique menu of tests is expanding our reference lab presence in the market. Once a customer has used IDEXX for any of their reference lab needs, our sales representatives can work to expand that utilization to more diagnostic categories with the goal of eventually becoming the customers' primary or sole reference lab provider.","While the most visible innovation we have added to the reference labs is with SDMA we also have several other areas of unique innovation including our fecal antigen test to find more intestinal worms not otherwise diagnosed and offerings in cardiac, molecular diagnosis, pancreatitis and several other categories of differentiated menu.","Speaking of SDMA we are targeting an end of year launch for SDMA on Catalyst. Our market research shows extremely strong interest among our Catalyst customers with over 90% of surveyed Catalyst customers saying IDEXX was necessary on their Catalyst and two thirds likely to purchase.","We will be offering SDMA for customer, for Catalyst customers in two forms. As a single slide that they can add together with a chemistry panel in a single run or in a combo kit with our T4 slide again to run with the chemistry panel in a single run as customers do with our T4 single slide today.","I'm very excited to announce that for practices that are buying the T4 slide today for the Catalyst they can add the SDMA slide in a combo kit at no incremental costs to the T4 slide. This offer is highly relevant. To-date two thirds of our US Catalyst customers already use the T4 slide and T4 is an essential diagnostic marker for thyroid disease, a major concern in both the dog and the cat.","If customers want to run SDMA as part of the chemistry panel that does not include T4 the SDMA slide pricing will be akin to adding an additional single slide to a Catalyst panel today in a way that is designed to encourage adoption and also augmenting VetLab recurring revenue per Catalyst installation.","We often get the question, will our introduction of SDMA in-house cannibalize, if you will, our reference lab volumes and the answer is quite the opposite. Testing always begets testing. In addition, we have a number of customers who use us for in-house testing around the world but don't use IDEXX for their send out testing.","To summarize on SDMA, customer appreciation for this remarkable addition to the chemistry panel is growing every quarter. We believe the launch of SDMA on a slide will lead to a relatively rapid ramp to adoption by our Catalyst customer base, increase loyalty, generate incremental revenue from utilization, not impact our reference lab volumes and yet perhaps most importantly, introduce SDMA to a whole new segment of customers who don't yet use our reference labs for chemistry profiles.","We find that once a customer experiences the benefit of SDMA in their practice with a specific patient and thus seeing better outcomes they realize they don't want to run chemistry panels without it whether in-house or sending out.","We are bringing a number of other innovations to the market in 2017, let me just update on three. First for our SediVue customers later this quarter we will update their instrument software using a second-generation algorithm that benefits from the 14 million images we received in the IDEXX cloud since the launch of SediVue. A reminder to investors, all of our SediVue customers are connected to IDEXX through the Internet sort of an Internet of Things strategy, if you will, using our proprietary SmartService technology. These 14 million images are 30 times the roughly 450,000 images we used to develop the first generation of the algorithm and will further advance the capabilities of the algorithm and the customer experience with SediVue. This is one of the most profound and unique advantages of our instrument business model. We can use big data, sourced from the field and machine learning to continually advance capabilities of an instrument such as SediVue DX and then automatically upgrade the instruments in the field in the background through SmartService. In this way the platform for existing and new customers just gets better and better with time and more big data.","Second, we have launched the PROREAD software update for SNAP Pro. PRORREAD allows SNAP Pro to automatically interpret results for all SNAP tests. We see increased loyalty to our rapid assay lines when customers adopt SNAP Pro into their workflow which supports continued growth of this diagnostic modality.","Third, our unique cloud-based VetConnect PLUS offering continues to gain adoption even as it grows in capabilities for our customers. We saw over 25% growth in engaged customers in 2016 to well over 14,000 globally and total connected customers with VetConnect PLUS is over 32,000.","We see growing views of radiographs through VetConnect PLUS and growth in VetConnect PLUS usage across all modalities, web, mobile and within the practice management software. Our VetConnect PLUS functionality and geographic coverage continues to grow as a result of continuous investment in this unique global cloud platform.","Note that we find that active VetConnect PLUS customers exhibit meaningfully higher loyalty for diagnostic recurring revenue. Our Company is executing well on all key dimensions and while 2016 was indeed an exceptional year for IDEXX what I'm most excited about is the opportunity that we have in front of us.","People love their pets the world over and want to take good care of them. Diagnostics as an essential part of the care equation with the pet are way underutilized in practice and at IDEXX we are all about enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. We see great potential to continue to expand our global markets.","I want to conclude by saying how grateful I am for the hard work and accomplishments in 2016 of our over 7,000 employees worldwide who pursue this purpose. And so, Cynthia, with that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. [Operating Instructions] and our first question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, Jon, Brian. Can you speak a little bit to the competitive positioning of SediVue? How has the feedback been in the field so far and has there been any sort of surprises in terms of consumables utilization, just sort of what's incorporated in your 2017 guidance in terms of placement trends, the revenue contributions? Should we expect some sort of promotional activity around NAVC? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, thank you for the question. Yeah, we're very excited with SediVue which is a whole new category of urine diagnostics and \u2013 so obviously a very, very successful launch and momentum. We will be continuing that in 2017. We don't really see any change in the utilization per instrument. We continue to believe it will be around $3000 to $4500 per year in very, very profitable recurring revenue per instrument installation. As I mentioned, we'll be updating the algorithm, but that won't be the last update, this instrument will continually get better.","I think what I would just step back to say is that, urine has a ton of diagnostic insight and historically while vets appreciated that, they were kind of hesitant to run urine because it was \u2013 there wasn't really a great way to do it. In-house it took a lot of tech time, 20 minutes, send it out to the reference lab, the urine changes. It's not as accurate. Everybody knows that. So it's kind of a between a rock and a hard place. And SediVue changes that.","So long-term we really see urine as a growing diagnostic category. In practice that is significantly underutilized in relation to bloodwork, chemistry and hematology, which itself is underutilized in relation to what I'd say the current standards of care would suggest. So I just think there's a lot of momentum and of course our field sales force is going to be continuing with that in 2017.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And Erin, I'd just add that our outlook for 2017, we expect or targeting placements of 2,000 or more globally for SediVue. So obviously that's building on the strong momentum we had in the U.S. and we should be seeing additional benefits from our expansion internationally.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Right. We just really started the launch at the tail end of the quarter in the U.K. and Australia outside of North America and we'll be rolling it out over the rest of the major markets over the course of 2017 outside of North America.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And I understand you don't want to comment on specific relationships like Banfield, NVA but I have to ask and broadly speaking how are your corporate relationships progressing? Are there any changes in your relationships, I guess, anticipated in 2017 particularly given the WOOF transaction and also are you placing SediVues into corporate accounts? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for those questions. We have outstanding relationships with all of our corporate accounts and continue to grow our presence in corporate accounts and so I think that is reflected in our expectations for the year. We don't really see any fundamental change with the transaction that was announced earlier this year it's a very competitive market, it will continue to be a competitive market. We have an outstanding relationship with the entities that make up Mars in their veterinary business.","And I would also just say that with regard to corporate accounts in general, what we see is actually the interest starts at the field \u2013 the interest starts in practices where they say, hey, this would really help our workflow and then corporate accounts we're always working at multiple levels.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just based on my math. It looks like the delta between your CAG recurring revenue growth and the industry growth you're tracking expanded quite a bit in the fourth quarter more than we normally would see. And I'm curious if there's anything in particular maybe it's a residual effect of the instrument placement starting to really come through but anything you would highlight that starting to try that delta between you and the industry data.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, I think we report global numbers of course right so we've got I think Jon highlighted that in international markets we had over 20% growth in consumable revenues and I think that's reflective of our efforts to expand the industry and the huge placement opportunities that we see \u2013 we've highlighted strategically. We think there is a 100,000 Catalyst placement opportunities globally and we've placed over 5,000 Catalyst incrementally this year.","So we took steps towards that big opportunity but we see a lot of runway to continue and that's supporting the higher growth. In the US, we've seen accelerating gains through the year and that's a combination of the Catalyst gains and we're starting to see some of the benefits of SediVue blowing into the consumable growth rate and that will be something that will support us moving forward. So, basically really strong sales and marketing execution globally, the benefits of the expanding Catalyst platform, and our ongoing test innovation.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah I would just add obviously very strong customer loyalty that is added to adding new customers. But the other thing, Ryan is, we're growing the category of diagnostics through innovation. For example, the SediVue that we just talked about, that's a whole novel element that previously wasn't part of the category if you will in any meaningful way; a very small supply or something of no consequence. But we're also growing in places like fecal antigen, SDMA is, people are now more, have a stronger case to do preventative care when SDMA is a part of the chemistry panel because now they can actually find diseases, not just chronic kidney disease, but other diseases that have a secondary impact of injuring the kidney and thus SDMA coming up.","And SDMA thus becomes a flag for something like a urinary tract infection, latent kidney stones or something like that. And of course that generates even more diagnostic revenue because you have reflex testing. So these are all kind of what we think are long-term secular trends that we are able to drive as a combination of bringing novel tests and innovation to the market and of course having a strong presence with our customers, so that we can educate and support them in the growing utilization.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, helpful color. And then Brian you highlighted this a bit but one follow-up on CapEx, I think, for 2016 came in quite a bit below your target, and you're looking for about 40% year-over-year growth next year, is that just timing and then if so anything in particular that caused that and that will drive the uptick next year? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It largely is timing. I think we basically had a pretty favorable year 2016 that was 3.7% of revenue...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Down from 50% the year before.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think longer term we've indicated we expect spending more in the 4% to 5% range and that's basically consistent with what we see in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, guys, good morning. I've got two. I'd say with that quarter, I am not going to, move on. I am not going to bug you about leverage. I will go in another direction and focus on international. Just, Jon, anything to slow down the international momentum, I guess what I'm grappling what is \u2013 you seem to have a lot of runway with Catalyst One, SDMA. SediVue is just first starting to gain traction. So maybe if you can just compare and contrast sort of the runway with innovation versus the various end markets, and if you are seeing or hearing about any pockets of strength or weakness in the different geographies?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. It's obviously people love their pets the world over and you mentioned some of the major innovations of that we're bringing. Interesting just on on SDMA, many markets, particularly \u2013 many markets in Europe interestingly are \u2013 they are more medically centric. And so SDMA is actually getting faster, if you will, pick up and sort of adoption and appreciation in those markets. Maybe it's because they're doing just sick animal testing, they don't do as much preventative care. For whatever reason the medical centricity is actually supporting the quicker appreciation for SDMA than we see in say the North American markets.","You mentioned SediVue DX, I mean, we really haven't begun the launch of SediVue DX it's not reflected in the 2016 numbers and of course SediVue is a profitable category. Not only for the obviously the recurring revenues and we'll be running \u2013 we'll be rolling out the pay-per-view \u2013 pay-per-run model globally as we have in North America but the instrument placement is also higher profit than our typical instrument placement.","And just as a reminder, we've made a series of investments including go-direct and strengthening our commercial organizations in markets such as Europe. In China we're very focused on the in-house market. In Brazil, people love their pets, in Brazil, and dress them very nicely but they don't have a full appreciation that veterinary care is also part of that an equation and so that's an attractive growth market.","Even though the Brazil economy is nothing that you would crow about, our business in Brazil is doing really well. We've opened a reference lab in S\u00e3o Paulo and of course we're very focused on the in-house business and it's also an attractive market for the LPD business.","And so it's interesting that we're seeing good growth in these markets that are in what I would call varied and not as, not always very exciting general economic areas.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay, very helpful and then Brian I'll just ask you about sort of the unknown of tax reform, and just your thoughts at a high level of would IDEXX be a potential net beneficiary with some of the plans at least being thrown around or discussed in Washington and maybe just from a COGS perspective if you could just comment on your manufacturing around the world and sort of net imported versus exported. Thanks guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's the big theme that you just noted at the end of your question, Jon, which is we are very much an exporter. We have over 20% of products that we sell in international currencies in foreign markets. We either manufacture or source here in the U.S., we have a large manufacturing capability here in Maine, which we are very proud of and look to expand.","And we do very limited actually production overseas that is sold into the US market. It's very selective. So I think it's hard to predict where tax reform will go, we're looking forward to that, but I think that the theme in a lot of the discussions are things that would help exporters and improve I think the climate for business. And, we're looking forward to more clarity on that front, but hopefully we'd be a net beneficiary if things go in that direction.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Jon, just I just want to give a big shout out to our Westbrook-based manufacturing. We are very proud that the Catalyst was designed and manufactured here in Maine and the prior instrument, the VetTest, which is obviously about 30 years old \u2013 25 years old vintage. That was not actually manufactured in the U.S. So we moved the manufacturing of our chemistry analyzer from outside the U.S. to the U.S. with the transition to Catalyst.","And so one of our many proud accomplishments here in Maine obviously, we're going to be \u2013 we manufactured the T4 slide here in Maine. We manufacture the \u2013 we'll be manufacturing the SDMA slide in our Georgia facility, it's where the electrolyte slides are manufactured, our core chemistry panels are manufactured for us in Rochester, New York. So, yeah that's one of the reasons why we're a very significant net exporter.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. A lot of color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, this is Anne Edelstein on for Derik, thanks for taking the question. A couple of broader market questions. First, did you provide a full-year same sales store gross estimate and just wondering if you think that given the expected uptick in U.S. discretionary spending, where you think that that growth can go in 2017, specifically if it can breach the long-standing high single digit growth bar?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for that. We didn't provide a specific outlook for 2017. Obviously we reported the data comes from over 5,000 practices of all different kinds and all different softwares each quarter. So you can see that we're typically in the 6% revenue growth on a same-store sales basis.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That's about what it was for the full year.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, for the full year 2016 \u2013 that's at the customer level not at our level. And so I think what's embedded in our outlook is really similar in 2017 kind of hard thing to forecast but we don't really see any reason to change.","Our first quarter will \u2013 we did have the benefit. It was a very strong quarter last year. Brian mentioned leap year, but it was also a \u2013 that was a very favorable weather and since we haven't finished the fourth \u2013 first quarter this year from a weather point of view that's always a \u2013 that can effect practice visits if people can't get to the practice from a weather point of view though. And, so that's a favorable compare that we have to \u2013 but we \u2013 people love their pets and one of the things we've said and observed is that while baby boomers were real big driver of the growth in pet care, they seem to have passed on to millennials an even stronger love for their pets and millennials keep \u2013 prioritize even higher than baby boomers their pets and making trade-offs to take care of their pets.","Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the commentary. And then another question on your livestock business, I understand that's a small revenue base but the lower herd screening revenue, is that something seasonal or are you seeing a fundamental change in that business?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, that's a number, the herd health screening, is a number that can move up and down. I wouldn't call it seasonal. I'd just say it's the propensity of exports from one country to another to ebb and flow. And so it's a pretty small number but it does create a little bit of year to year volatility in the LPD growth rate.","Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next will come from the line of Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Two questions; first on the margin expansion that you saw in the fourth quarter and pretty much all year. I think you've kind of talked about every quarter, if I go back to the transcripts, that you kind of delayed some expenses or expenses were a little bit lower than what you were thinking and I am just trying to get a better sense of why can't the significant constant currency margin improvement you saw in 2016 not be delivered similarly in 2017, particularly if consumables and recurring revenue is \u2013 should be accelerating amidst the premium placement launches that we saw or placement that we saw in 2016. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. We are planning for continued operating margin expansion and operating expense leverage in 2017. So that's factored into our outlook. It's at the midpoint of our longer-term goal. And, so I think we are intending to build and we did flow through the strong operating performance in 2016. So we're building on top of the progress that we made this year.","I think in terms of this year we \u2013 I'm sorry last year, 2016 \u2013 we clearly had very good revenue growth at the higher end of our goals. We were full three points above our original growth goals for the year. So I think we entered the year with a series of investment plans based on a level of growth that we significantly exceeded and that helps us to deliver relatively more operating expense leverage and we're clearly getting a great return from the sales and marketing investments that we made. In fact that was the biggest area of leverage that we took advantage of this year, this past year.","So we always have variations in terms of like when we actually execute hires and things like that that may change quarter to quarter, but I think the longer-term theme here is, we believe we can grow at very healthy rates and continue to get leverage out of our model while we're investing towards the significant long-term growth potential we see in the business.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Just to add with what Brian said, we've seen high ROI on incremental absolute OpEx and \u2013 so we're going to continue to double down and grow in our \u2013 that because that helps drive organic growth of very profitable revenues which then translates into areas of gross margin and allows us to achieve some operating expense leverage. So, that's one of the benefits of enduring growth model that we can both simultaneously make investments and achieve both gross margin and operating expense leverage.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for that and then secondly on SDMA, largely today it's free for most customers who are your existing kind of reference lab users adding to the kind of normal chemistry panel. And then you said today that you're adding it to Catalyst by the end of 4Q and two-thirds of your Catalyst customers already use T4 and you're going to be giving it away for free within the T4 as well with no incremental cost. So I'm just trying to better understand how we go from the revenue today of SDMA to the $200 million that we're hoping for by 2021 in context of a lot of this being added without incremental revenues. So, just maybe better understand maybe the price levers that you're pulling to drive that figure. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for highlighting that and it's an area that's really exciting for us. Of course, what SDMA does is it grows the entire diagnostic modality. We get higher customer retention than we otherwise would have. It allows us to attract new customers to the reference lab modality. It allows us to achieve maybe modestly higher price realization and utilization. What we're doing is we're estimating what the incremental impact is on SDMA in all those categories and none of that is direct, if you will, revenue from SDMA itself, because just to rephrase what you said, we're adding it at no incremental charge if they bought a chemistry panel from IDEXX in the reference lab.","And we are adding it at no incremental charge on in-house if they're already buying the T4 slide. And, what we see though is that we'll probably have greater T4 SDMA utilization per customer than we would have had T4 standalone. And, of course if they are just wanting to add SDMA to the panel and not T4 we would suggest they should want to run T4 because actually our big data just recently showed that one in seven dogs, regardless of age, across the entire age cohort, has a low T4 rating which would suggest a thyroid or other disease that needs to be further investigated.","I mean that's healthy dogs. That's not sick dogs. That's healthy dogs. Can you imagine, if you had a disease, you would have a one in seven chance of getting it, that you might want to get tested for that. And it's one in 10 cats. So we would recommend that they run the \u2013 that's kind of the case for T4, but then we've got a great case for SDMA, so why don't you just run the two together and add it to your profile.","But if they ran SDMA without T4 then of course that is going to be incremental revenue on top of all those other sources which will support the modality growth in the modality revenues of instrument consumables and then give more customers exposure to the value of SDMA. What we find is when SDMA has, provides clear information they would not have otherwise gotten, they act on it and they see different patient outcomes they realize how important it is to have SDMA as part of the core chemistry panel. And so we're adding a whole new class of customers who wouldn't have had that experience once we launch SDMA on a slide.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Super helpful. Thanks, Jon. Congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys, great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on SediVue and would love to just get a little bit more clarity around \u2013 you launched it, I believe, April of last year. Now that you have three quarters in the books can you speak to customer level feedback and then can you also speak to the number of tests per day per box that maybe some people initially were running and are running now? Has there been any lift and can you speak to utilization of SediVue and the early install base?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes. Well, thank you. It's roughly, they're roughly running one a day. And that's what gets us plus or minus and that's what gets us to the $3,000 to $4,500 per year in recurring revenue on a SediVue placement. That is way underutilized but that is what we've seen in the first nine months. Still obviously very, very early days. I think as customers continue to appreciate the value of urinalysis, we would hope for that to grow but that's going to be a long-term trend. That's not going to be a short-term trend as all trends on growing utilization in diagnostics are in veterinary medicine. But I think customers are very excited about adding urine to the category and we're only at 1,500 out of 25,000 plus customers in the U.S. so we've got a lot of runway.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Excellent. And it's really hard to poke holes in your quarter and especially given the fact that you posted your strongest quarter in the U.S. in Q4 relative to any other and you did it in a period where the same-store Cornerstone volumes increased 1.4%. It's a little bit lighter than we've seen earlier in the year and Jon, you called out Q1 was certainly helped by weather. But as we think about 2017 same-store volumes do you think you can get back to that maybe 2% same-store volume level and just maybe speak to the drivers around some of the moving parts? Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Just one quick correction. So that 5,200 practice is not just Cornerstone. It's \u2013 we get data from all different practice, four, five different practice, it's very representative to the market. And so I think it's pretty good data; 5,200 observations of real data is pretty good data. Look you know the Q4 \u2013 the revenue growth in the practice is what, 5.8%. So that was a \u2013 that trend data can bounce around; you look for the average of the year was higher than that. I don't think there's anything in particular that would suggest that that is the start of some kind of trend. And we are providing on our website that historical information in graphical form so I might point you and investors to that. Thank you and thank you for your kind comments.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you. Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our final questions will come from the line of David Westenberg from CL King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. So I will keep it short, since it's already been an hour, so \u2013 you highlighted the strong consumables versus instruments on a go forward basis, but you didn't necessarily highlight that in the margins. Is that already reflected in the guidance update for this quarter or is there a possible upside to some of the margins with that? And then, there's kind of a second part to that, and that is, if there is some upside in that and you have any maybe updates or puts and takes that could change the outlook from that 50 to 100 basis point long-term margin expansion, operating margin expansion goal?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We're comfortable with that outlook. I think the growth in our recurring revenue base is a positive dynamic on margins and if we continue to grow at strong rates that's helpful as well both on gross margins and operating expense. We do intend to continue to invest towards the long-term growth opportunity. Jon highlighted some aspects of that today in the call in talking about the sales and marketing investments we want to continue to make globally which are yielding very high returns.","So we're comfortable with delivering on that balance and it reflects if you look at our EPS outlook for 2017, normalized for foreign exchange and for the accounting guidance change, it's right in-line with the 15% to 20% that we said we were targeting delivering and we look forward to having another great year in line with our long-term goals.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Perfect and I am looking forward to seeing you guys at NAVC.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Great. Same here. Appreciate the questions.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And I think with that we are going to conclude the call. We appreciate everybody calling in. I also just want to reiterate my huge thanks to the 7,000 plus IDEXXers around the world who come in every day to pursue our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. And it's just gratifying to see and to be able to report and to be able to represent the outcome of their efforts with investors as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017.

I'm pleased to take you through our fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2016. We had a solid finish to 2015. We achieved 11% normalized organic growth in Q4 supported by 12.5% normalized growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and continued strong gains in instrument placements. Recurring CAG growth improved from Q3 levels supported by gains in US rapid assay revenues and higher consumable growth rates in Europe. Our full-year normalized organic growth was 11.3% slightly above our expectations reflecting solid year-end performance. Full-year results were supported by 13% normalized organic growth in total CAG revenues, reflecting strong double-digit gains in both US and international markets.","Full-year adjusted EPS was $2.11, above about the high end of our guidance range reflecting solid operating performance and $0.03 per share benefit from the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS grew 14% in 2015. Our operating trend positions well to deliver strong constant currency revenue and EPS growth in 2016. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results beginning with an overview of regional performance. In reviewing our results today, please note that we will be normalizing down year-on-year growth rates to adjust for transitional impacts related to our move to an all direct sales and distribution model in the US in the fourth quarter of 2014. This included a reduction in revenues of $25 million in Q4 2014 related to the elimination of product inventories held at distributors as well as cost associated with ramping of sales resources and one-time cost associated with the transition.","We achieved solid organic growth in US and international regions in the fourth quarter, driven by improved CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and strong growth in our water business. US revenues were $239 million, up 12% on an normalized organic basis. Gains were supported by 13% normalized organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Note that in the fourth quarter of 2014 we started selling some of our US kits and consumables direct in parallel with the year-end reduction of US distributor inventories. This resulted in approximately 1% of prior year growth benefit in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues from this accelerated margin capture, which we have not normalized for us.","So our underlying Q4 2015 growth rate in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues improved solidly from Q3 levels. Recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumable revenues as expected and solid gains in rapid assay sales. IDEXX performance outpaced strong US market growth in Q4 reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q4, patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 7.1% compared to the prior-year period benefiting from strong growth trends in November and December. For the full year, our US revenues were $980 million. We achieved US normalized organic growth of 12% in 2015, driven by 13% normalized organic CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. International revenues in the fourth quarter were $167 million reflecting 10% normalized organic growth.","International results were supported by 12% normalized organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting strong and improved growth in consumable sales across major regions including Europe benefiting from record levels of new instrument placements. Full-year international revenues reached $622 million or 39% of total IDEXX revenues. Normalized organic growth of 10% and benefit from acquisitions were offset by foreign exchange rate changes resulting in a 2% reduction in reported international revenues for 2015. For the full year, international normalized CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 11%, reflecting 9% growth in Europe, 15% gains in Asia-Pacific and 44% growth in Latin America.","Turning to segment performance, our Q4 results benefited from very strong instrument placements. Global premium instrument placements increased 35% in Q4 supported by 61% growth in catalyst placements. Global instrument revenue of $29 million was up 28% organically year-on-year in Q4, including a modest 1% growth benefit from deferred revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers. For the full year we placed 4,944 catalysts and 3,744 premium hematology analyzers globally representing growth of 59% and 17%, respectively, well ahead of our goals. Including VetTest placements in international markets, we placed 9,771 chemistry and hematology instruments in 2015, demonstrating significant benefits for our investments in our expanded global commercial capability.","Strong premium instrument placement trends including continued high placement levels at competitive accounts in the U.S. in both chemistry and hematology are supporting continued expansion of our premium instrument base. We ended 2015 with an active installed base of approximate 20,000 catalysts and 21,500 premium hematology analyzers globally. Our U.S. premium instrument base expanded approximately 3% this quarter sequentially supporting 16% year-on-year growth in our Catalyst installed base net of estimated customer losses in the U.S. over the last year. Catalyst customers now account for 97% of our U.S. consumable revenue exclusive of corporate accounts. ","Our hematology installed base also expanded solidly in the U.S. this year driven by 30% growth in ProCyte. Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued solid gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q4, global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $277 million, up 12.5% normalized. Overall, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reached $1.15 billion in 2015 or 72% of IDEXX revenue.","CAG recurring annuity growth reflected solid gains across modalities. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $125 million grew 11% organically in the fourth quarter. Gains were supported by 13% volume-driven revenue growth in the U.S. compared to strong prior year growth rates and 7% gains in international markets. Instrument consumables revenue of $98 million in Q4 grew 16% organically when normalized for the prior year reduction in U.S. distributor inventories associated with the go direct transition.","Please note that in Q4 2014 global consumer growth benefited by approximately 2% from accelerated U.S. margin capture associated with the go direct change. With this factored in, comparable growth in consumables increased by about 2% in the quarter from Q3 growth rates, reflecting continued solid growth in the U.S. and accelerated gains in international markets.","As expected, U.S. consumer gains were moderated by carryover impacts from heightened competitor placement activity in our U.S. customer base in Q4 of 2014 and the first half of 2015 which partially offset benefits from new customer placement gains in 2015 and solid same-store growth trends.","Rapid Assay revenues increased 9% normalized in Q4 to $39 million. Note that Q4 2014 Rapid Assay growth results also benefited by approximately 2% from accelerated margin capture reinforcing the solid underlying performance in the quarter. Q4 Rapid Assay performance was supported by volume gains in SNAP 4Dx kits in the U.S. continued stabilized trends in first generation products, and benefits from U.S. margin capture. Our results demonstrate our maturing commercial capability to support this segment and increased customer understanding of our superior test accuracy. As we look ahead to Q1, we expect Rapid Assay revenues overall to be relatively flat as we anniversary growth benefits from U.S. margin capture and work through relatively tougher comparisons early in 2016.","Combined information management and digital imaging system revenues increased 6% on a constant currency basis supported by 5% organic gains and benefits from acquisitions. For the full year, combined information management and digital revenues reached $111 million supported by continued expansion of our cloud-based platforms and increased penetration of our information management service offerings. In Q4, information management revenues increased double-digits. We also continued to drive solid digital imaging system placements supported by our highly differentiated cloud-based platform.","Consistent with recent quarters increased digital imaging system placements that were integrated with multi-year diagnostic business commitments which result in deferred revenues constrained overall Q4 growth. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue grew 2% organically in Q4 to $33 million as benefits from our expanded pregnancy testing and strong poultry and swine sales in emerging markets offset year-on-year declines in livestock services revenue in Australia. For the full year, our LPD revenues were $127 million down 10% on a reported basis as 2% organic growth was offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange rate changes. ","Our water business revenues grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter reflecting worldwide increases in core product sales and benefits from the launch of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product. Q4 capped a strong year of performance in water reflecting solid underwriting market dynamics and benefits from commercial investments that drove new business gains across major regions. ","For the full-year 2015, water business revenue reached \u2013 increased to $97 million, up 2% on a reported basis, supported by 8% organic growth, which offset foreign exchange rate pressures. ","Turning to the P&L, gross profit was $218 million in Q4, up 20% on a reported basis reflecting comparisons to prior-year results impacted by the reduction of inventory held by distributors in advance of our transition to all direct sales and distribution model. This resulted in a one-time revenue reduction of $25 million with an associated negative one-time gross profit impact of $21 million. Adjusting for this impact, gross margins increased moderately year-on-year as lower product costs and benefits from moderate net price increases offset mix impacts from very strong instrument sales. ","Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $6 million or $0.05 per share in Q4. Operating profit in Q4 was $67 million. On a comparable basis, Q4 operating margins were down modestly compared to prior-year levels as expected reflecting year-on-year growth in global commercial expenses. For the full year, operating profit was $300 million or $308 million adjusted for the one-time software impairment charge reported in Q3. This reflects an operating margin of 19.2% including approximately 130 basis point of benefit from $20 million -- $21 million 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains. ","EPS in Q4 was $0.48 per share, up normally compared to prior-year adjusted EPS and up 9% adjusted for currency impacts. The permanent extension of the R&D tax credit added a $0.03 per share to EPS results, consistent with Q4 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.11 and 2015 foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by 6%, operating profit by $21 million, net of $21 million in hedge gains and EPS by $0.16 per share. Despite these impacts, we delivered 6% growth in adjusted EPS or 14% growth in EPS on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid underlying operating performance and disciplined and substantial investment in the US fully direct model.","Free cash flow was a $145 million for 2015 or 75% of net income. This equates to approximately 86% of net income adjusting for net working capital changes associated with the US go-direct change. Free cash flow was slightly lower than our expectations reflecting timing of year-end net tax payments, growth in volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher levels of inventory in support of new instrument and test platform launches. We\u2019re targeting free cash flow at 95% to 100% of net income in 2016. ","Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital towards share repurchases. We repurchased 1.3 million shares for $93 million during the quarter. In 2015, we repurchased nearly 5.7 million shares or about 6% of our diluted shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015 for $406 million. ","We ended 2015 with $1.17 billion in debt outstanding. At year-end, we had $343 million in cash and investment balances and $276 million of borrowing capacity available under our recently expanded $850 million revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios is a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude the impairment change with 2.95 times gross and 2.09 times net of cash and investment balances at year-end in line with our long-term target range. ","Our solid finish to 2015 positions us well to deliver continued strong constant currency revenue and profit growth in 2016. Today, we are reinforcing our outlook for organic revenue growth and increasing our EPS outlook by $0.01 per share reflecting benefit from the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit and operational upsides, which more than offset additional headwinds related to the continued strengthening of the US dollar. ","Foreign exchange impacts related to the significant strengthening of the US dollar will be key variable impacting our reported financial performance in 2016, given that approximately 25% of IDEXX\u2019s revenues are related to products manufactured in the US and sold in local and international currencies. We have updated our financial outlook to reflect more recent rate --exchange rates, which have weakened relative to the dollar since we issued our preliminary guidance. At the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release, we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will reduce reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 2.5% and EPS by approximately $0.26 per share, including impacts from the tapping of 21 million in 2015 hedge gains and a 50 basis point increase to our tax rate due to profit mix impacts. ","In terms of revenue, our updated outlook is for reported 2016 revenue of 1.69 billion to 1.71 billion, 25 million lower than our preliminary guidance, driven entirely by the continued strengthening of the US dollar over the last three months. This outlook reflects consistent goals for 8% to 9% organic growth in 2016. Note that 2015 revenue growth benefited by about 0.5% from the recognition of deferred instrument revenues associated with our Catalyst One launch in the US. So our underlying targeted organic growth in 2016 equates to 8.5% to 9.5%, adjusted for this impact. ","Growth will continue to be driven by our CAG business supported by targeted full-year growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflects goals for sustained double-digit global reference lab gains, strong above market growth in consumable revenue, supported by our expanded instrument installed base and modest growth in rapid assay. We expect to see improvement in our CAG recurring revenue growth rates in the second half of 2016, as we work to carryover impacts from prior year competitive impacts and consumable and rapid assay revenues in the first half of the year and as we benefit from annualization of higher customer retention rates that we achieved in the second half of 2015. ","While we\u2019re up against some challenging comparisons to very strong instrument placements in 2015, we are targeting solid gains in CAG instrument revenues as well, supported by the launch of SediVue and premium chemistry and hematology placements consistent with the record levels achieved in 2015. ","In the US, our focus in 2016 will be on placements at new and competitive counts. As noted, lapping of deferred revenue benefits in 2015 will moderate reported instrument revenue gains for the year. For 2016, we\u2019re targeting sustained mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in our water business and mid-single digit gains in LPD, supported by continued expansion of our pregnancy franchise and growth in emerging markets. ","In terms of P&L metrics, consistent with our preliminary outlook, we\u2019re targeting approximately 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis in 2016, supported by operating expense leverage. Please note that this outlook adjusts 2015 for the software impairment charge recorded in Q3. ","Reported operating margins will be lower than prior year, driven entirely by foreign exchange impacts, including the lapping of hedge gains which will lower reported gross margins. Net of these impacts, we expect that operating margins for the full year 2016 will be 18% to 18.5%. As noted, free cash flow is projected at 95% to 100% of net income for 2016, consistent with our strategic plan outlook. Capital expenditures are estimated at approximately 90 million. ","Strong cash flow generation will support continued capital allocation towards share repurchases, resulting in estimated reduction of approximately 3.5% to 4% in our shares outstanding. We expect to maintain gross leverage levels of approximately 3 times EBITDA and expect annual interest expense of 32 million in 2016. ","Our full-year outlook reflects a projected effective tax rate of 30% to 30.5%, including benefits from the R&D tax credit. These drivers support a 2016 EPS outlook of $2.10 to $2.17 per share, which equates to 12% to 15% growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. ","In terms of our entry rate heading into 2016, we expect Q1 normalized organic growth to be 8% to 9%. Note that Q1 includes an extra day due to leap year, which we estimate will -- helps Q1 growth by about 1%. Year-on-year foreign exchange changes, including the lapping of 4.5 million in prior hedge gains will be significant in Q1, resulting in a 3% reduction of reported revenue growth and nearly 8 million of headwind to operating profits. ","These impacts as well as the lapping of the ramping of incremental commercial resources globally in 2015 will result in reported operating margins of approximately 250 basis points below prior year Q1 levels resulting in lower year-on-year reported operating profit and EPS levels in the quarter. ","That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2016.","Jon Ayers","Okay, thank you Brain. We were pleased with the continued progression of our growth globally in Q4 of 2015 as well as the progress in bringing first and only innovations to our market. Coming out of 2015 and all investments we have made, we are well positioned to achieve our financial goals in 2016. Certainly a highlight of our Q4 2015 performance was our record level of instrument placements globally that Brain reviewed including the 61% growth in catalyst placements in Q4 and 59% for the year. Another way to look at it, in 2015, globally we replaced more than twice as many catalysts as we placed in 2013. Q4 was the highest premium instrument placement quarter for IDEXX globally on record exceeding the quarter we just established in Q3. In the North American companion animal market, we achieved impressive results on a number of important metrics that we track.","First, catalyst placements were at record levels of 694 units. Importantly, placements in new and competitive accounts grew to 395 units; up 37% over Q4 of 2014, which itself was a quarterly record. Hematology placements were strong too at 582 units, driven by ProCyte our higher-end platform. Second, early indications from an analysis of our US installed base shows that customer chemistry retention rates continued at their strong levels of Q3 of at least 97% annualized, if not slight further improvement. Third, the growth of the reference lab modality in the US continued at a strong 13% and was primarily volume led with about 2% attributed to price. Fourth, our rapid assay business in the US delivered strong results, our all-important SNAP 4Dx unit volumes continued to be up for the quarter and for the year. On top of that, we had a very strong double-digit growth in 4Dx in the lab for the year, which now is about 10% of volume of the SNAP test kits.","First-generation rapid assay generation revenues and volumes continued in Q4 their trends from Q3 of volume and revenue stabilization. And in accordance with our expectation set early in the year. Fifth, the reach and frequency of customer visits by our veterinary diagnostic consultants reached record levels in Q4 of 2015 at over 48,000 visits, a quarterly total which is grown an average of 10% every quarter this year as we perfect the new sales model and territory management. Note that the 48,000 visits does not include customer visits from the other 123 field-based professionals that support our diagnostic recurring revenue in the US, including our instrument specialists and professional service veterinarians.","Sixth, we saw record high percentage of our instrument kits and consumables purchased through our e-commerce channel at 57%. This is a world-class level for the US veterinary practice market when compared to other companies that sell direct, which is actually pretty amazing given we've only been at this for 13 months. When customers go online instead of calling us to submit their orders, this frees up our 75 inside sales professionals to focus their efforts on out bound calls and demand generation. In fact, our outbound call line increased nearly 20% from Q3 to Q4 when factor driving our continued good rapid assay performance.","So this array of metrics provides objective evidence that our US fully direct sales organization including over 300 field-based diagnostic specialists, our phone-based employees and the use of other marketing channels including digital marketing are having greater and greater impact on growth of our diagnostic recurring revenues in the US. Given the highly profitable and durable nature of the CAG recurring annuity, this CAG recurring annuity, higher growth of these revenues from our expanded commercial capabilities yields a high incremental return on our investments. We are clearly maturing the fully direct organization with growing productivity and a presence that builds on customer relationship with every passing quarter.","In international markets, we achieved a nice rebound in the growth of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Europe, in Q4, specifically after a slow Q3, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were up 10% bringing the full-year to up 9%. As an interesting aside, our Brazilian business achieved 112% growth in the CAG in local currencies. Too bad it\u2019s such a small contributor to global performance. This shows that even in a tough macroeconomic, emerging markets like Brazil and China can show strong local currency growth when we have a capable local team and attractive pet healthcare market that is early in the adoption of the diagnostics.","Regarding our SDMA roll-out, we now have over 13,000 US customers receiving results on 1.6 million tests run through the end of 2015. As of this month, we have launched SDMA in our reference lab chemistry profiles in more than ten countries globally including all of the major markets, positioning us for continued strong growth in global lab revenues for years to come. In the US, the number of accounts ordering SDMA that don\u2019t use us as their primary lab grew 34% year-over-year in December and the volume of their submissions grew 80%. Clearly the professional as a whole is beginning to appreciate how important a parameter SDMA is as a screening test for kidney disease.","One final comment on SediVue before we open the call to Q&A. We were tremendously pleased with the customer reception we have received to-date regarding SediVue, our novel first and only urine sediment analyzer for use in the veterinary practice at the point of care. We are finding that SediVue intuitively appeals to a wide range of veterinary practices. And interestingly, customer interest level show little to no correlation to their current level of IDEXX diagnostic use in-house or reference lab. For this reason, we believe SediVue will not only provide an attractive revenue stream from instrument sales and patient runs, this novel point of care solution will also allows to introduce IDEXX's entire diagnostic offering to customers using competitive instruments and\/or reference lab services.","As we have indicated in the past, our 2016 guidance assumes we place 1,000 SediVue analyzers at an average unit price of $16,000 to $18,000 per instrument. Each placement will generate an annualized stream of recurring revenues using our innovative new pay-per-run pricing model of between $3,000 and $6,000. This month we began to build taking orders and building a backlog including at the North American Veterinary Conference last week, where the novel analyzer garnered a lot of attention. We are targeting customer revenue shipments against this backlog in April and do not expect to be capacity constrained in serving the market over the course of the year. In summary, key innovations such as Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue are examples of how we are generating an attractive return on our R&D investment and commercial growth around the world.","So with that, Cynthia, we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Daniels","Yeah, good morning and thanks for all the color. Jon, maybe a quick question for you just on catalyst as we look towards 2016. I know you mentioned it got approved in Japan, so I guess two specific questions on that. One, when will that actually start shipping? And then number two, I know Japan is a pretty receptive market for new technology. So what kind of market opportunity is that as we look to kind of \u201816 and \u201817 in instrument placement?","Jon Ayers","Yes, Japan is a diagnostic market that really is oriented towards in-house point of care real-time care and it\u2019s a market with significant opportunity because we probably have a lower share in Japan than any other market that I can think of. And of course Catalyst One is a blockbuster product that we've proven in virtually every other market around the world and we have a good organization, a direct organization in Japan that\u2019s in place for decades. So it's going to be a nice combination. We've also launched VetConnect PLUS in Japan which I think is highly appreciated by the Japanese veterinarians because they are very visually oriented. And so, we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunity in Japan for the next couple of years.","Ryan Daniels","And do you have a data on when that will start shipping?","Jon Ayers","They\u2019ll start shipping this quarter.","Ryan Daniels","And maybe a follow-up on the financials just on Capex. I think you are guiding towards about $100 million as recently in October but it came in about $83 million. I think next year the guidance is only $90 million. So I'm curious if you're seeing any specific capital efficiency that\u2019s allowing you to trend that down and could drive stronger long-term free cash flow?","Brian McKeon","Yeah we\u2019re always focused on that Ryan, I think this year part of that was just driven by kind of year-end privatization and also some carryover into \u2013 that\u2019s not unusual at year-end where project is going to carry over into the next year and that's all factored into our $90 million outlook. I think our numbers is still probably a little higher than they normally would be just reflecting the very strong volume growth that we\u2019ve had in reference lab as well as some of the work we're doing on enhancing our manufacturing capability with new products but I think we\u2019re \u2013 our long-term outlook would be and our focus would be on continuing to drive capital efficiency. So we think that can be a point of leverage for us over time.","Ryan Daniels","Okay, thanks I\u2019ll humpback in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of John Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Block","Great thanks and good morning. Jon, maybe just first one on international CAG, you sort of laid it out that it was choppy last quarter and it seemed to improve this quarter. But oddly enough there is some orders that are calling out some international weakness in calendar 4Q. So, maybe just walk us through how you see the international market unfolding now that you have entered 2016 and just your level of conviction at the worst is behind you there?","Jon Ayers","Yes, thank you for the question. The weakness that we saw specifically was the deceleration in recurring revenue growth in Europe; obviously in international markets we've had extraordinary level of growth in Catalyst One placements including Europe. And that varied same quarter of Q3 I think, we had 169% year-over-year growth in catalyst platform placements internationally. And so we hypothesized in Q3 that was related to very hot weather in markets that don\u2019t traditionally have air-conditioning, believe it or not, that\u2019s Continental Europe. And it was nice to see the rebound to 10% recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth in Europe.","Other markets around the world I think have just been very strong. I mentioned Brazil, Asia is very strong and so I think we have the combination of investments we\u2019ve made in a direct and strong commercial organization for the last years internationally combined with new innovative market leading products such Catalyst One. VetConnect PLUS is now - I think we have customers using VetConnect PLUS in 60 countries and of course now the global rollout of estimate for our reference lab modality which gives us confidence that we will continue to have above US growth in the international markets in part because they are simply far less mature in their - not that US is mature, but they are just so much earlier than the US in their adoption of diagnostic protocols for pet healthcare. ","John Block","Got it, very helpful. And then just on guidance and I just find my opinion, but I find the two set of ways that you call that an operations on a $2 plus number, just a little bizarre at this stage of the year considering the events of last year. So can you just talk to your confidence that this isn\u2019t going to be sort of the one step forward, two steps back in terms of the guidance and maybe tell us why you decided not to just keep some dry powder in case the environment gets even more competitive as the year progresses? Thanks guys.","Jon Ayers","Yes, John, thank you for that question. What a difference a year makes. I think we're not entering a huge disruptive change. We are beyond that disruptive change and we are seeing the progression and productive of our commercial investments in the US and internationally. We expect to get productivity on those investments and operating expense leverage particularly in the US market in 2016. So we don\u2019t enter the year with the kind of risks that we entered last year. The only think I can\u2019t really comment on is macro, but out underlying markets are very strong, so it's more of an issue of currency and those kinds of things.","Brian McKeon","Yeah, John, just to highlight, the adjustment is entirely related to we had better than expected operating margins finishing the year in Q4 through good cost management. So we\u2019re basically just flowing that through. We are still targeting 50 basis points of constant currency improvement and really all you are seeing is that we had a very good cost management at the end of the year and we are flowing that through and driving toward the same objectives we talked about earlier. It\u2019s actually not an increase in our revenue outlook. We maintain a consistent - ","Jon Ayers","The 89% organic growth is consistent with the guidance in October.","John Block","I appreciate it guys. Thanks. ","Jon Ayers","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffrey. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple in the reference lab business. So the 13% growth in the US was pretty strong I guess. Could you quantify or break down how much of that\u2019s coming from share gains and I guess how much is coming from vets ordering more tests per requisition. Obviously you are getting great traction with SDMA. And I guess kind of following upon that as well, how much of the growth from SDMA is coming from non-IDEXX customers? Jon, I think you might have mentioned that.","Jon Ayers","Yes, thank you. Well, of course vast majority of our customer does come from continuing \u2013 revenues does come from continuing customers. So I think what we're pleased with the non-customers is that the growth in sending us panels is demonstrating that they are voting with their feet and seeing SDMA as an attractive addition, but those numbers are small contributors to overall reference lab growth.","Getting back to the first part of your question, I think that the trends are balanced between net new account acquisitions and same-store sales account from existing customers who are adopting more and more of our unique menu innovations such as fecal antigen and some of the other tests that we offer. And in some cases we may have a core customer who is using us as their primary reference lab, but maybe not using us entirely.","And so with the value that SDMA brings to the core chemistry panel perhaps, they are shifting more of their \u2013 what they may have been splitting more their chemistry volume to us. And of course we have net new customer acquisitions which is also contributing to that growth. [Indiscernible], I mean continued strong retention metrics and new customer acquisition exceeding whatever customer losses that we're seeing.","Kevin Ellich","That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. Brian, I think in your prepared remarks you made a comment that in Q1 you expect rapid assay to be flat. Can you go over what\u2019s driving that again? I think you said tough comps and analyzing the margin capture?","Brian McKeon","Right, I think we obviously don\u2019t get the benefit of the margin capture as we move into 2016. And so it is really reflecting that we will have some compares from some of the losses in the first generation product that have stabilized.","Jon Ayers","Which occurred over the course of Q1 and Q2 of last year, so we have to anniversary those.","Brian McKeon","But I would highlight, it\u2019s kind of a solid positive projection in rapid assay that we're seeing and it reflects that from we had some headwinds here that we've been sequentially improving in terms of the performance with very good growth in the 4Dx business and we're going to be working through some of these compares and that will contribute to relatively flat performance in Q1.","Kevin Ellich","Right. And then I guess one last one. Did you guys give any stats out on Cornerstone in terms of the numbers of users or anything like that?","Jon Ayers","No, but we are happy to. We have a highly loyal Cornerstone and DVMAX is our client server platform, about 7,000 customers. I think the loyalty in that customer base is 99% plus. We continue to invest in those platforms, but our focus on new customer placements will be with Neo, our cloud-based platform which is unique in not only its ease of use, but the fact that it has virtually zero upfront cost for customer to start using consistent with cloud technology and it has full integration into our diagnostic ecosystem.","And so that will be a small but because of we don't get upfront revenues, the same \u2013 the customers don\u2019t have upfront cost, but a growing contributor to our installed base building on top of the high loyalty we have with Catalyst and DVMAX customers. It\u2019s interesting if you look at the information management and digital revenues that product line that we report actually at this point a little over 50% of those revenues are what we consider recurring revenues. There are kinds of things like subscriptions and maintenance and add-on services and the rest is things like hardware and supply sales, they are not what we call non-recurring, they are not capital per se, but they are hardware and supplies and our data business. Very good performance in 2015 and we are well positioned in 2016 to build out our cloud-based customer adoption through our five or six cloud-based offerings in that segment. ","Kevin Ellich ","Thanks again. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. ","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. So I think Neo has rolled out now in January and can you help us to understand what the impact will be on the digital imaging business as presumably more people will order the subscription based Neo as opposed to the more capital intensive cornerstone. So can you just help us understand the impact as we look at our model for Q1, Q2 throughout 2016? ","Jon Ayers","Well, the growth in that segment is going to come from not only Neo, which really won\u2019t be a large element that will be a growing and strategically important element, but we are also growing the adoption of add-on services, primarily cloud-based incremental services to our Cornerstone and DVMAX install base as well as continued growth in our digital radiography, including the cloud-based software that supports and stores all the images on cloud, and one needs to have a local server and backup and all that just the radiography system fully integrated with Cornerstone and with Neo. So it\u2019s really both the continued growth and continued replacements, but more importantly the growth in the recurring revenues Neo and these add-on services to the existing install base that will propel profitable growth in that line of business in 2016.","Mark Massaro","Great, thanks. And on SediVue, I think at the conference last week, you \u2013 I think you mentioned that SediVue would sell for $20,000, is that the list price, because today I think you said 16 to 18? Is the 16 to 18 more your expectations for an average sale price? And when you take the midpoint of the recurring stream that you provided today and thank you for that color, would get me to somewhere around $21.5 million incremental for \u201916 from SediVue? Any clarification there would be helpful.","Brian McKeon","Yes, let\u2019s just a latter point, I think we can all do the math, I can\u2019t \u2013 you can take 16 to 18 in times of by a 1000 and that\u2019s pretty easy because $16 million to $18 million and then the incremental value as that install base grows, obviously you got pricing analyzers and they got to start using it in order to generate the recurring revenue of the pay by run. We are selling the analyzer at 19, 9, 95, but in cases that we are selling it in a bundle with other equipment to competitive accounts, when they are buying, they are looking at SediVue and then they are saying, hey, this is a new look at IDEXX and I see the benefits of IDEXX and fully integrated approach and all the key differentiators, now I\u2019m looking at SediVue for catalyst and hematology. When we put on our bundle, we will have a lower unit price associated with the SediVue placement and in some cases, some deferred revenue. So that\u2019s really what brings down \u2013 we are selling it at list price, because it\u2019s our first and only innovation and customers are so excited about it, we have no pushback on that. But the average unit price will come down. And then we will have some sales in the latter part of the year that will be international and will probably at lower AUP, so those are things that bring down the average unit price from the list price. ","Mark Massaro","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And last question for me. Thanks for commenting on the annualized 97% customer retention rate. Would you say that\u2019s modestly ticked up, I know you have called out some stability, say in Rapid Test. But I don\u2019t recall you providing that number in the last couple of quarters. I know it\u2019s in line with your historical numbers, call it 96% to 99% customer retention. But can you just help us understand if that has ticked up at least modestly in the last couple of quarters?","Jon Ayers","It definitely ticked up in Q3. We saw big, a nice tick up in Q3 from \u2013 in fact it\u2019s on \u2013 as we look the annualized retention rate by quarter, it turns out that fourth quarter 2014 was our most challenging quarter. And every quarter since then the annualized retention rate for that quarter has ticked up and it ticked up to about 97% in Q3, and what I will say is, sometimes it just takes us a little while to absolutely solidify that number. Early indications are for Q4 as we sit here four weeks into 2016 because it takes time to see the dust settle and look at customer ordering patterns to really be secure. But certainly the early indications are that we were \u2013 we maintain if not a slight improvement in that metric in Q4 2015. ","Mark Massaro","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nick Jansen","Hi, guys, nice job finishing the year. Just wanted to better understand Brian, maybe the moving parts for the first quarter. I think you guys reported a 11.1% organic growth in the fourth quarter when you addressed for the distribution dynamic in the prior year and I think if I heard you correctly, you are saying 8% to 9% for the first quarter, but that includes kind of 100 basis point benefit from leap year. And you have had a lot of moving parts in terms of share erosion and things along those lines. So can you perhaps maybe bridge the delta from that 11.1% normalize to let\u2019s call it a core 7% to 8%? And then how we get the ramp for the balance of 2016, I assume SediVue and others are built into that. But it will be helpful to better understand the mechanics of the guidance is, I think investors are still trying to figure out all the moving pieces given the variety of moving parts that we have seen over the last five quarters. Thanks. ","Brian McKeon","Sure. I think one of the key elements in the bridge is you have to recognize if the 11% in Q4 benefited from margin capture, right, so you have to \u2013 comparing that Q1, you have to normalize for that. So basically that\u2019s in a range of 3%. We don\u2019t quantify that specifically anymore. But say we are at an 8% level and we are effectively saying 8 to 9 or 7 to 8 adjusting for leap year. And so it\u2019s largely consistent trends. We did have really strong instrument revenue growth year-on-year in Q4, so that\u2019s obviously benefiting us. I think we are targeting continued solid progress on recurring CAG growth and improvement as we work through the year as we \u2013 Jon highlighted these improved retention rates and working \u2013","Jon Ayers","For the Chemistry customer base. ","Brian McKeon","The consumables and for also the rapid assay kind of working through the headwinds there and getting to a place where we are growing versus down on a margin, excluding margin capture, we had some headwinds, of course, this year from the first generation losses. So those things will benefit us as we work through the year and we\u2019re basically projecting Q1 for another strong quarter.","Nick Jansen","That's very helpful. And then secondly, I've always assumed that, let's call it, the churn rate, at least in North America of instruments is like a 5 to 7 year cycle where you\u2019re not necessarily. Once you buy one, you\u2019re going to be working with it for a while. Have you seen that change over the years? It just seems like the interest rate numbers that obviously you guys are poising are quite strong and even some of your competitors certainly not as strong, but still are poising a fair amount of instruments. I'm just trying to get a sense of how easy is it for a customer to say, I'm going to use catalyst this year and then next couple of quarters, the distributor comes in and they switch to Abaxis or a competing machine. Has there been any change in kind of the churn, because it feels like there has been, but I can't fully grasp it? Thank you.","Jon Ayers","Yes. Thank you. I think the instrument placement is pretty sticky as evidenced by our estimate of 97% retention on an annualized basis. And so that will be 3% of customers who are in our installed base, as measured by the revenue that they are contributing, the consumable revenue that they are contributing are switching to different analyzer. That is, what I call a very, very sticky and loyal installed base and I think in the case of IDEXX, that\u2019s because they\u2019ve adopted elements of our in-house lab whether it be advanced 2a integration or unique menu or the benefit of real-time care or VetConnect PLUS integrated with the reference lab results. Also, of course, when they purchase an analyzer, they typically buy it either in a six-year lease or some kind of a contractual commitment, multi-year contractual commitment, which also adds to the stickiness. So it is not, it's a very sticky installed base to answer your question.","Nick Jansen","Thanks for the color. Nice job.","Jon Ayers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl & Co. Your line is open.","Ben Haynor","Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry if I missed it, but did you give the visit and revenue growth?","Jon Ayers","Yes.","Brian McKeon","The market growth?","Ben Haynor","Correct.","Brian McKeon","Yes. No. We did. Q4 patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 7.1%.","Jon Ayers","So that was a very strong number. That number can bounce around from quarter to quarter. I think we saw one quarter since the Great Recession that was higher than that, but certainly I would suggest that the underlying market trends are robust.","Ben Haynor","And then secondly, for me, are you seeing competitors become more aggressive at all on equipment pricing in North America?","Jon Ayers","I would say that it\u2019s always a very competitive environment. And I think the difference in terms of IDEXX is that customers value unique aspects of what our solutions provide that they cannot get from others. And so if something is lower price but does not provide an adequate solution, that isn\u2019t going to be something that customers like to do. In addition, I mentioned \u2013 our veterinary diagnostic consultants are really now covering the market, you think of 48,000 visits in a quarter, they are basically covering the market price over on average. ","And so our reach and frequency into the customer and that's just with our veterinary diagnostic consultants, which are around 180, we have another 120 other types of field-based professionals that are also visiting customers, we are present. We have those relationships and I think customers value those businesses, because we are bringing value, both in terms of support and new innovation. And so always a very competitive market. But we win with a combination of innovation, new and unique personal innovations and a very strong commercial presence.","Ben Haynor","Great. That makes sense. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Jon Ayers","Thank you.","Operator","And with that Mr. Ayers, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jon Ayers","Yes. Thank you, Cynthia and thank you everyone for joining the call. I just want to also, a very special callout to IDEXX employees, our 6000+ employees who\u2019ve worked really hard this year or last year, should I say, 2015, in the phase of a lot of competitive and macro challenges to deliver what I think was a very strong finish to the year. A special callout to our North American Field organization that has really done a great job in coming online with new territories and establishing customer relationships and bringing value and growing the level of care that our customers are providing to pet owners. ","This is a very satisfying outcome for all of us at IDEXX, when we see this kind of growth that we\u2019re driving and we\u2019re seeing care providers being successful, both medically and economically, and pet owners benefiting with improved health of their pets. And so it really gives us confidence that we\u2019re on the right strategy for sustained growth for years to come with the investments we've made in 2015, both in the US and around the world. ","And with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Participating in the call this morning are Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and Kerry Bennett, Vice President-Investor Relations.","IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.","In reviewing our first quarter 2018 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth, and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2017 unless otherwise noted.","In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. IDEXX's strong business momentum continued in Q1 reflected in another quarter of excellent financial results. We achieved 16% reported revenue growth driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument placements and favorable FX changes.","Our reported revenue and 12% overall organic growth results reflect the implementation of the new revenue accounting standard, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. In Q1, $12 million of revenue was attributed to implementation of the New Revenue Standard. A significant portion of this amount related to the introduction of a very successful multi-modality customer program called IDEXX 360, which drove strong U.S. premium instrument placements in the quarter.","EPS was $1.01 per share, an increase of 32% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, solid operating margin gains, and net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.","In terms of our outlook, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, as $15 million of operational upsides reflected in our updated projection for 10.5% to 12.5% full year organic revenue growth are offset by impacts from the strengthened U.S. dollar.","We're increasing our 2018 EPS outlook, $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20 or 30% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This incorporates our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement, resulting in a $0.04 per share full year operational upside. Our outlook also incorporates an additional $0.02 in projected benefits from stock compensation activity. These upsides are offset by a negative $0.04 per share impact from updated FX assumptions.","We will review our updated 2018 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Please note that, as we review our results by segment, the organic growth rates referenced include benefits attributable to the New Revenue Standard. Q1 performance was led by continued momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $471 million, up 13% organically driven by strong gains in recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued high growth in our digital business.","Global recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues increased over 13% organically despite a 1% equivalent day headwind. These results included a $4 million or about 1% benefit from revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to impacts from our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 10% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and 40% year-on-year increase in digital system placements.","Our Water business revenues grew 12% organically in the first quarter to $29 million, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. and strong gains in international markets, including about 3% in year-on-year growth benefit from our Brazil go-direct initiative. These benefits will moderate as we work through the year. Water growth in Q1 reflected about 2% growth benefit attributed to later ship-off cutting rules under the New Revenue Standard.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 2% organically. Strong gains in pregnancy product sales, solid growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues and higher herd health screening levels were offset by continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues.","By region, U.S. revenues were $327 million in the quarter, up 13% organically driven by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables, and high-single digit growth in rapid assay sales supported by solid volume gains in our 4Dx franchise.","U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also continued to improve supporting our accelerated growth profile. IDEXX U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from about 7,500 clinics. In Q1, patient visits were up 0.6% and clinic revenues increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period, a slight moderation from recent trends impacted in part by less favorable weather comparisons.","International revenues in Q1 were $210 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 13% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected continued high consumable revenue gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base and increasing utilization and strong growth in European lab revenues.","In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by expansion of our premium instrument base and strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities. Globally, we've placed a Q1 record 2,822 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior year levels. These results were driven by 1,403 Catalyst placements, a 24% year-on-year increase, 664 SediVue placements, up 72%, and 755 premium hematology instruments globally. In addition to the strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,190 SNAP Pros in the quarter, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 20,000.","Continued strong Catalyst performance was driven by 1,034 placements in international markets, up 39% year-on-year, and 288 placements to new and competitive accounts in North America. Consistent with our strategic focus, 78% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts in the quarter. Globally, our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 22% year-on-year in Q1, reflecting 10% year-on-year growth in North America, and 37% year-on-year gains in international markets.","CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 were $31 million, up 12% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change. As noted, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S., which provides customers with benefits from doing business across IDEXX's product lines, and supported our success in driving SediVue and Catalyst placements in the quarter.","Our EVI index increased at a double-digit pace in North America. And we're now using this approach in our international markets as well, aligning our placement strategy globally with maximizing recurring CAG Diagnostic annuity revenues. Benefits from an expanding instrument base, test innovation and enhanced commercial capability, continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities.","Consumable revenues of $150 million grew 17% organically in Q1. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across U.S. and international markets. Our focus on innovation continues to drive growth in real-time care with SediVue and SDMA on a slide, contributing nearly 3% combined to year-on-year consumable gains in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $187 million grew 14% organically in the first quarter. Gains were driven by continued mid-teen organic reference lab gains in the U.S. Strong U.S. gains continue to be primarily volume driven reflecting high levels of growth with existing customers and steadily improving new customer acquisition and customer retention rates.","We also achieved high single digit lab growth in international markets, compared to strong prior year growth levels, supported by higher gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues of $52 million grew 7% organically in Q1. Continued solid rapid assay gains were driven by volume growth in 4Dx and first-generation products, supported by seasonal stocking programs, as well as continued net price gains.","Operating profit in Q1 was $113 million, up 23% as reported, or 18% on a constant currency basis, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. (10:31) of 100 basis points on a constant currency basis supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage from our strong revenue growth results in the quarter.","Gross profit was $303 million in Q1, up 17% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins increased 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. These gains were supported by continued solid net price gains and volume leverage in our VetLab and reference lab businesses, which offset effects from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits and about 20 basis points of gross margin impact from OpEx to cost of goods, cost reclassifications in our lab business.","Foreign exchange hedge losses, which impact gross profit, were approximately $2 million in Q1. Operating expenses in Q1 were up 15% or 11% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 50 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases reflected year-on-year impacts from our expanded U.S. commercial capability, higher levels of R&D investment, growth in enabling information technology capability, and impacts from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits.","EPS in Q1 was $1.01 per share, including $9.6 million or $0.11 per share in benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which tends to be highest in Q1. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 32% including net benefits from U.S. tax reform.","Our effective tax rate was 14.3% in Q1, including 9.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2017 and 2018, increased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.04 per share.","Free cash flow was $11 million in Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality. We continued to maintain our full-year outlook for free cash flow of 80% to 85% of net income for 2018, including approximately 15% of free cash flow impact driven by $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation, as well as $5 million of incremental growth capital investment supported by additional cash flows associated with U.S. tax reform. Incorporating these investments, our 2018 free cash flow outlook for projected capital spending remains at $140 million.","We allocated $86 million in capital to repurchase 465,000 shares in Q1. We also used our increased flexibility under U.S. tax reform to optimize our global cash and debt balances, resulting in a reduction in our revolving debt outstanding. We ended Q1 with $1.020 billion in debt, $159 million in cash, and $442 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.87 times gross and 1.58 times net of cash and investment balances.","We're maintaining our 2018 full-year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA. We continue to project annual net interest expense of $35 million to $36 million.","In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're maintaining our full-year reported revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, incorporating $15 million of benefit from a 1% increase in our expectations for a full-year organic revenue growth now projected at 10.5% to 12.5%. This outlook reflects consistent expectations for 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and increased expectations for instrument revenues, including benefits from our strong Q1 performance and growing premium instrument placements.","Operational revenue upsides are offset by a $15 million adjustment to our FX assumptions, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We currently estimate a 1.5% revenue growth benefit in 2018 related to foreign exchange at the rate shown in our press release, resulting in full-year reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%.","We're raising our 2018 full year EPS guidance $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20, reflecting an outlook for 30% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This incorporates 4% in operational upsides related to our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement.","We're also refining our outlook for our 2018 effective tax rate to 19.5% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $12.5 million to $16.5 million or approximately 3% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. This provides $0.02 per share on EPS upside compared to earlier estimates. Offsetting these benefits are updated projections for year-on-year impacts in foreign exchange rates at the rates shown in our press release.","We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will increase reported EPS by $0.07 per share, approximately $0.04 per share below earlier estimates. This is net of approximately $5 million in currently projected hedge losses. There's been a significant amount of movement in currency rates in recent days related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and our outlook incorporates recent FX rate levels. In our 10-Q, we highlight sensitivities to change in currency rates. Based on our projections an additional 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce balance of year revenue by approximately $6 million and operating income by approximately $1.7 million net of hedges.","In terms of our second quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 12% to 13.5% range supported by organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 11.5%. In terms of our P&L outlook, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat in Q2 compared to prior year levels, reflecting relatively tougher year-on-year comparisons in the quarter as well as impacts from tax reform related reinvestment and lab information system cost reclassifications.","We also expect relatively higher year-on-year growth in operating expenses in part driven by timing of R&D investments. Combined, we expect these factors will lead to flat Q2 2018 operating margins compared with prior year Q2 levels of 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be 21% to 22% including projected benefits from share based compensation exercise activity.","That concludes the financial review. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Brian. Our strategy to advanced standard of care for pets around the world is purring along nicely as we wrap up the first quarter of the new year. Great results shared by Brian. Sales force and professional productivity in growing the business with our customers was the standout theme for the quarter. And this is evidenced by our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13% globally.","As investors know, we have moved to an economic value index or EVI to measure quarterly instrument placements both for our reps commissions and for IDEXX. EVI measures the quarterly impact of the value of instrument placements in building profitable recurring revenues. Prioritizing efforts by EVI of placements and empowers our field professionals to allocate their time and efforts to a mix of placements and programs that maximize long-term shareholder value.","In Q1, we moved to this EVI compensation and measurement system with our international operations, building on the success of the North American field transition to EVI in the beginning of 2017. As Brian mentioned, the EVI of our North American placements grew double-digits in Q1 of 2018 supported by exceptional growth of SediVue. For the rest of the world, the year-over-year growth in EVI from instrument placements was far stronger supported by both strong unit placement and greater percentage of Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts. Of note, new and competitive placements of Catalyst outside of North America, was up 56% year-over-year in Q1.","We also continue to align our commercial efforts across our modalities to support customer growth and advancements in the standards of care. In Q1, our German team successfully transitioned our commercial organization from two different roles focused separately on instruments and labs respectively to a single account coverage model that we have used in the U.S. for the past several years. In this model, a single sales force supports and advances the full IDEXX offering of in-house instrument and reference lab diagnostic offerings. Our German team executed this transition brilliantly. Along with being fully direct in Germany as we are in most markets around the world, we're now set up for accelerated growth in this very important country just as we have achieved in the U.S. since we made the change to a customer-centric sales model.","Innovation continues to be a key driver globally. Expanded menu on our instrument platforms including T4, SDMA and CRP, an inflammatory marker, grow the same customer instrument recurring revenue and contributed to our 17% organic instrument consumable revenue recurring growth as well as growth \u2013 another contributor, of course, was growth from SediVue recurring revenues that came from new instrument placements. New menu adoption by our Catalyst customers will continue to be a growth driver for years to come and of course increase the value of a new Catalyst placement.","Our remarkable test for kidney function IDEXX SDMA had its first quarter of general availability in our in-house Catalyst customer \u2013 chemistry platform in North America in Q1. In this short period, 42% of North American Catalyst customers have adopted the test in clinic with the vast majority of these already using it on a regular basis.","Having our proprietary SDMA Test on our in-house instrument, advances several strategic growth objectives for IDEXX. Obviously, Catalyst SDMA generates a new stream of instrument consumable recurring revenues. Second, it further secures the long-term loyalty of Catalyst customers as the test is unique to IDEXX. Third, as customers add SDMA to their in-house profiles, they build upon their reference lab experience with IDEXX accelerating to what we term the journey to believe that SDMA is an essential element of the routine chemistry panel.","The independent KOLs at the pinnacle of veterinary medicine have already completed this journey as they have been involved with and informed of full complement of studies, which provide the irrefutable evidence of SDMA's clinical value as an early indicator of a variety of diseases that have in common that impact kidney function. To put a point on this, in one study, looking at the blood profiles of dogs and cats having a wellness exam adding SDMA to the existing chemistry panel of 21 tests, just one additional test, uncovered another 50% of patients versus the baseline of 21 tests that needed further work-up.","In other words, even in seemingly healthy patients, SDMA dramatically increases the detection of hidden problems. The statistics shows just how important and profound SDMA is as a diagnostic innovation in routine wellness, and in fact the importance of routine wellness testing not to mention sick animal testing.","Catalyst SDMA was launched in Canada in January and the UK in March. The other major international countries will follow in Q2 with a few in Q3. The addition of the SDMA T4 combo kit for Catalyst, another advancement in point of care testing will launch in about a month in North America.","Speaking of new products, an update on our SNAP Fecal launch timing. The assay is performing well and detecting intestinal parasite and our expected regulatory approval timeline is on schedule. The product prototypes are currently in field trials with customers, part of our disciplined new product development process that we use with all products in development. And as is typical of any product, we get many new insights with new to market products in the hands of technicians and practice before the formal launch.","We've concluded there are certain workflow improvements that need to be made to deliver the exceptional customer experience expected from IDEXX. We anticipate these changes to be relatively straightforward, but will take a few extra months to validate. Given this pushes the launch into the very busy Q4, we're planning on a formal launch at the beginning of the New Year.","Our new revenue guidance which we've increased on a constant currency basis by $15 million for the year fully reflects this new SNAP Fecal timing assumption. The guidance reflects tremendous momentum we have in the business today. I might note that with all the innovations that we have in the field and that we're bringing to the market in 2018, our field has no shortage of new products and services to sell, be it in reference labs, in-house instruments, and new test menu.","I also want to comment on our veterinary software offerings with double-digit constant currency growth in Q1. In Q1, we had more than 1,600 customers who use our cloud-based practice information management software or PIMS. And we continue to grow our overall PIMS software customers and revenues, which include the franchise, Cornerstone and DVMAX product lines. All four of our PIMS software platforms are undergoing major investments leading to advanced capabilities for our customers, improved user experience and the support of multi-location corporate accounts, a growing segment of the market.","Our cloud-based applications that customers subscribe to, in order to add value to their PIMS whether IDEXX PIMS or third-party, are also advancing in customer numbers and capabilities. These apps include cloud-based software to support wellness plans, digital radiography packs, client communications, multi practice enterprise management, and a specialty referral CRM for managing relationships with specialty referral clients to referring veterinarians.","The grand daddy of all veterinary software applications in terms of footprint and the global market is VetConnect PLUS. With over 22,000 practices who use VetConnect PLUS each month, 12,500 of which are in the U.S. We broke 2 million results views in the U.S. alone in Q1, 2.9 million globally. That 2 million is an average of 160 results views for every active VetConnect PLUS IDEXX account in the U.S. market.","We estimate that no other veterinary software in the world has even half the number of active accounts on a global basis. And IDEXX diagnostic customers that are highly engaged with VetConnect PLUS grow their diagnostic revenues at a rate three times faster than non-engaged VetConnect PLUS customers, which is why we're pleased that the adoption and utilization of VetConnect PLUS grew more than twice the rate of our underlying diagnostic volumes in Q1.","Between our PIMS, our apps and the VetConnect PLUS franchise, we are uniquely positioned in veterinary software globally. And our guidance contemplates, as Brian mentioned, with the R&D accelerated investments in these platforms in 2018.","Our software strategy confirms several strategic advantages for IDEXX. We can help our customers grow faster, grow profitably, while supporting staff engagement and productivity, so important to practices in the current labor environment. We accelerate IDEXX diagnostics usage and loyalty, and grow the profitable recurring revenues of both diagnostics and our veterinary software and services, and digital radiography businesses.","In conclusion, the key elements of our strategy are clicking innovation and commercial execution which drives adoption of these innovations, and a software strategy that builds upon our diagnostic offering to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. All of us at IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people and livestock.","So with that Cindy, we'll open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Thanks so much. Can you speak to the nature of the Fecal SNAP timing change? Just what are you seeing in the initial field testing? And should we think of a bigger ramp in Fecal SNAP in 2019? I guess how much was truly embedded in 2018 assumptions originally? And also maybe the competitive landscape, are you seeing anyone in the wings as far as the Fecal SNAP test goes? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, great. As we mentioned, this really has no impact on our 2018 guidance. Our field team has a tremendous number of offerings to sell. Catalyst now with SDMA and the SDMA T4 combo kit, SediVue which just tremendous runway ahead of us, what a great product, hematology, we're still highly differentiated in hematology, the reference labs, both growing utilization and winning new customers. Preventative care is a big growth driver, organic growth driver for us and the industry's SNAP Pro placements. You saw the digital radiography, the software, the VetConnect PLUS with major advancement. So really, we see the small amount of revenues that we had in our original plan is really being supplanted by growth in all these other areas, and really gives us confidence for the year.","In fact, Q1 is the most logical time to launch a new point of care SNAP assay at the beginning of the year with a lot of focus on new products. We're going into the season for \u2013 we're testing most intestinal parasites around people's minds in the summer when dogs are at the dog parks. And we do not expect or see anything on the competitive front. This was quite frankly the assay, which is performing very well. It took us ten years to find and develop the reagents for the three key worms, which we offer by the way in the reference lab. We have a fecal antigen, one of the big drivers of reference lab growth. And that's all a proprietary reagent. So, we think this will be a proprietary product for a long time certainly if you look at the length of our patents.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And Erin, it will obviously provide a nice uplift for our growth in terms of being all incremental compared to this year. I think you had a question on competitive to this, this is not related to anything going on competitively.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And then I think your competitive placements overall for instruments were pretty strong. I guess what was some of the key drivers of that? I mean any sort of promotional activity or just better traction and better sales force maturity there? Anything you could, I guess, elaborate on would be great. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think we're continuing to innovate in how we advance the customer's journey to belief in the importance of our innovative diagnostics and the care of the pet. I would put it mostly on sales force productivity and not just sales force, but of course the supporting marketing. We have the importance of our other professionals in the field whether they are the professional service veterinarians and the field support reps. Our international had a tremendous growth. I think that was the adoption of EVI for international, obviously the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger in understanding how EVI can drive profitable growth.","And yet, we still are discovering innovations to advance the customer's journey to believe in all areas, whether they are the importance of a fresh urinalysis to preventative care. It's amazing the amount of hidden disease. We've done a study for wellness really well, absolutely nothing wrong, by the way nothing wrong to the pet owner, nothing wrong to the veterinarian upon the exam, and yet one in eight dogs and cats in the adult age, one in six in senior and two in five in the geriatric category have evidence of underlying disease when you run the basic chemistry, hematology and SDMA. I mean these are extraordinary numbers. And we're bringing these numbers to the field. I mean, they are both the importance of testing and of course the addition of our unique proprietary assay such as SDMA and our advancements in the hematology area, which remain unique.","And so, this is a huge opportunity for growth. It's shocking that only 14% of clinical visits in our customer base, which is probably more advanced in the customer mix generally include a basic chemistry panel where the sick animal are well and roughly half the visits are wellness. So, there is tremendous opportunity for growth ahead of us in the diagnostic category, and of course that's going to relate to overall practice growth because when they find things, then they need to address them.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I was hoping you could provide a bit more detail or color around IDEXX 360 in regards to when that was launched and what it encompasses? And I'm curious if that's primarily targeted at new customers or new placements or if that's more broadly positioned across the entire customer base?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, thank you again for the question, Ryan. It's a really interesting question. It's certainly not a boring question. It's been very successful to us, the launch of the IDEXX 360 program in the first quarter of 2018, in North America. We call it 360 because it's all encompassing or complete. And really what it is is it's a friendly way for customers to adopt more of our portfolio and also adopt more of our menu in our instruments. And so, the reason why it's called 360, it's an all-encompassing or complete diagnostic offering and really leverages the fact that we have a complete portfolio of in-house and very full in-house with the urinalysis and the rapid assay and the reference lab to grow the business.","And it's also \u2013 a second reason is, it gives a 360-degree view on the patient's health. Because you can combine both what you might run on an in-house test with what you might reflex or run on the reference lab and have all that available to you in VetConnect PLUS with advanced testing options that are unique to IDEXX.","So it is a program which leverages the fact that we're in all the modalities and makes it easier for customers to adopt, whether it's new systems or come over to our reference lab growing same-store sales, winning new customers on a modality basis, and it's been \u2013 as you can see, it's been very successful, which is interesting because any new programs sometimes takes the field a little while to learn and they picked this one up relatively quickly in the first quarter with great success.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful color. And then as my follow-up, one on the sales force more specific to the international operations. You discussed Germany in particular is moving to kind of a single sales team like the United States. And I know internationally the EVI launched. How broad if you look at your non-U.S. business now, have you kind of moved that towards the U.S. sales model with the combined team in EVI? And how far along or what inning do you see that in because I know that could be a big uplift for international growth longer term? Thank you.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. It turns out people love their pets all over the world and the opportunity for us is in basically every market depending on its size. And so we're about 99% of our Companion Animal Group revenues are sold direct which gives us full opportunity to work with the customers to grow utilization. And as you know utilization and just diagnostic protocols outside of the U.S. are behind where the U.S. are.","EVI is essentially, although not 100%, it's essentially adopted in all of our direct markets. There are a couple of remaining small markets that are still in process. And for the most of the markets we do have a customer-centric Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant model. Germany is a very important country for us. Because there is tremendous in-house opportunity for us and, of course, we have very strong lab presence that we're augmenting with the adoption \u2013 with building out an expansion and a new core lab in Germany which, of course, will be a network for a variety of European countries as well as Germany.","And so each country has its kind of unique aspects in terms of our sales model, but we're very pleased. It's not easy to translate. As you all told us when we did this several years ago in the U.S. market, it is not easy to move sales roles. And I'm just very proud of our German team for doing it and showing that it can be done. I think we leveraged a lot of learnings from the U.S. in doing that in Canada. We're pretty much a common model in Australia. So as you can see here, it's becoming more and more, but it's a step-by-step process. We're not fully adopted yet.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions on some of the moving pieces for the quarter. You had, by our notes, one fewer selling day, and you also talked about the weather impact in the U.S. in the northeast in March as have others. And then there is also Easter timing in Europe. So I was just wondering if you could sort of parse out the headwinds from those issues? I mean you still put up a good print despite that, but I'm trying to get a sense of sort of the underlying performance if you normalize for these one-off effects?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. It was basically a 1% headwind on recurring revenues which we noted. The weather is a hard thing to parse. I think it didn't impact our business. We had a great quarter. I think in the market. Overall it likely had somewhat of headwind, but it's just a little tougher to estimate. But I think the one...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It was a normal winter and last year was a mild winter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And so it just reinforces we had great performance, very strong performance. I'd point out in markets like Europe, we had up against a tough compare in the lab business, we had a really nice quarter there as well. So very pleased with how we started the year particularly in context of some of that.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That helps. And then to clarify one other point. The accounting change, the revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09. On the 4Q call when you raised the guide for the year by 50 bps, you called out that that was due to that accounting change. And then in this quarter you recognized, you called out an incremental $12 million. That looks like it's right about the 50 bps for the year. So is it right that you're not expecting any more incremental revenue for the rest of the year from the accounting change?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, why don't you take...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Those are two different things. So obviously what we talked about in the Q1, much of that was anticipated in Q4, right? So it wasn't incremental for the Q4. And we have \u2013 this now aligns with instrument revenues.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Why don't I just take a minute to give you a little background on the accounting impacts because it takes a minute to kind of digest and understand. But, look, as context, we raised our outlook for 2018 by $15 million and that reflected the Q1 performance as Jon talked about as well as our updated projections for placements and program mix which are all aligned with this new revenue recognition standard.","And I think it's important to understand that under the new standard, the instrument revenues are now going more closely track placements. So if you think across the different programs that we have, revenues under volume commitment programs and rebate programs and upfront programs are all basically in that aligned now with revenue recognition, at the time of the placement.","When you look at the accounting, what's attributed to the accounting impact, calculations of what's attributed can be impacted by changes in program mix which are independent of how many you place. So, for example, under this new accounting guidance, 100% of the revenue from a new program like IDEXX 360 is treated as being related to the implementation of the new revenue standard. And the reason why is that under previous GAAP, this is basically a volume commitment program. Those revenues would have been deferred.","So basically what you have is program mix shifts, which don't impact our view on placements, which drive revenue are being \u2013 are attributed to the accounting standards. You just can't take that first quarter effect and multiply it by four. What we did is we're updating our placement view. We took up the full-year numbers based on the strong start. It's all aligned with the new standard that has upfront revenue recognition. And as we work through the year, we'll do the reporting to go what's attributed to new standard, but I wouldn't focus on that metric as how to get at our revenue outlook, if you will.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. I really appreciate that, Brian. If I could squeeze in one quick one. You talked about pricing gains for the year on CAG. Specifically in rapid assay, the 6.7% organic, strong volume in 4Dx. But can you talk about pricing on that, specifically for rapid assays and then for the 4Dx, was there anything going on in the quarter?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Our pricing was up. I mentioned that.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We had kind of the seasonal stocking programs we typically do. And that increase was net of those sets of programs. And our outlook for the year is we're trending in that 2% to 3% range and that's consistent across the modality. So we're continuing to get solid net price gains, but more of our growth is being driven by volume growth, and we've got excellent momentum on that front.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, great. Thanks so much, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe 2.5 questions, just one small clarification. So the first one, just 1Q 2018 market growth was a little lighter, market growth that is, was a little lighter per your metrics, actually in line with some of our checks as well. So anything that you can share for April, Jon, or just at a higher level I guess what I'm asking is do you think this was all weather specific, and that the overall industry trends remain solid? That's the first question.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I'd say, in summary, I think the overall industry trends remain quite solid. Q1 can be a little bit bumpy.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","But we see overall trends are quite solid. There is no reason to believe that they are not. And I would have mentioned that the revenue growth at the practice level was really not that different than what it has been historically at that 4.8%.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then just certainly impressive to increase the guide, especially considering the new timing on SNAP Fecal antigen. That said, I should have always thought about IDEXX, you're the innovator maybe at least one new product per year. And so should we now think that SNAP Fecal antigen is that product for 2019? Or I guess any other tricks in the bag that you can allude to? And then I'll just have my final clarification question.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I mean the product we're really pleased about right now is the Catalyst SDMA. This is an enormous product. It's interesting. You've seen the \u2013 you saw the 42% adoption rate in a very short period of time in the U.S. market, which really just shows the underlying demand for SDMA that we've built from the reference lab. Now some of those customers don't even use our reference lab. And so maybe they will use our reference lab now that they see the value of SDMA. And so we've got \u2013 and then we've got just great \u2013 we've got a completely differentiated hematology offering. Obviously SediVue is going great guns.","And so when you launch a product, you've got like several years, many years of growth ahead of you. Clearly SNAP Fecal will be a big focus of launch in Q1 2019. I'm not ready to talk about any other products at this point in time, but you should expect, of course, continuous improvement in our existing products. So we just launched, for example, the new image algorithm for SediVue, Neural Network 3.0. And we expect to have a cadence of annual algorithm improvements that comes from the fact that at this point we have over 1 million patients that have been run on SediVue, and we use that with machine learning to advance the algorithm. Of course, it's unique to our Smart Service, the fact that all those images come back every day. And so the products will continue to have incremental advancements. But we're going to be \u2013 we have good product launch now scheduled for the beginning of 2019 with the SNAP Fecal.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, perfect. And a clarification, and Brian I think this is for you and hopefully I don't butcher this too bad, but you put up organic growth in CAG of 13.1%. The accounting change, if I remember correctly last quarter, was a 50 bp tailwind for 2018. Was that sort of going to come on board ratably throughout 2018? Or maybe asked differently, normalized for that accounting change, were you essentially at 12.5% for this quarter? Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes. I'm going to go back to kind of the earlier responses that I gave, which is I think when you're trying to take what's attributed to the accounting change and adjust growth rates, I don't think will help you understand the trends in the business. And that the way the accounting disclosure work is, you attribute benefit to the accounting change for a new program like IDEXX 360 as if it's 100% related to an accounting change. And obviously this is a successful new program. It's just a mix change.","So what I'd say is the underlying growth we were above where we thought we were going to be because we have really good instrument placements. And as we look at the updated full-year outlook, we've flowed that through, and we took it up more based on the momentum that we see and our estimates of what the program mix will be. And basically under all the programs, Jon, now the instrument placements are much more aligned with \u2013 the revenue is much more aligned with when you place the instruments. So we feel comfortable with that. And we'll try to help you understand the growth rate impacts, et cetera. But I think the underlying momentum of the business is very strong and sustainable under the new recognition standards.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thanks for your time, guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on a great quarter. My first question is really on the news of Henry Schein's decision to spin out its animal health business and merge with your neighbor, Vets First Choice. Vets First Choice seems to be making some inroads by engaging pet owners. And so, I guess, I'm wondering if you can comment on the strategy of working directly with the pet owners, does that potentially have any overlap with any of the initiatives you have in your software initiative?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, first of all, we would like to congratulate the Henry Schein and Vets First Choice on their merger. As you know, we've moved away from distribution a number of years ago and we have a fully direct model which has been very, very successful for us. I would say that anything that engages pet owners, and in this case I think it's more compliance on with Vets First Choice, it's more compliance on therapeutics and preventatives and that kind of thing. But anything which grows the profession is good for the profession and is good for IDEXX. And so if this is pulled off and good, it's going to be a positive for us and a positive for practices as we firmly believe that pet owners \u2013 if practices can better serve pet owners, the underlying demand for pet care is \u2013 it's underserved, but dramatically underserved. And anything we can do or others can do to help practices better engage with pet owners is a good thing. So, yes, so that's our point of view.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then I know that Neo is a product that you guys launched a couple of years ago. Can you just give us an update on how the traction of that platform is going? Are you perhaps contemplating your software strategy in context of what Vets First Choice is doing in the market?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We're very pleased with the progress, Neo which is cloud based. We're also pleased with Animana and between the two of them, we have 1,600 customers who use our cloud based practice management software.","And of course, we also have a variety of apps which integrate with ours and other third-party softwares that add value for the customer. And so this is I think an exciting area, it's a dynamic area. We've made some accelerating investments in 2017 and more in 2018. And we really have an unparalleled U.S. and global footprint when you add up our PIMS or apps or VetConnect PLUS presence, all of which are back to that prior point of helping customers run their practices better, more efficiently and engage with pet owners better and thus advancing the growth of the profession. So we really think we have a sort of unparalleled offering and it's very important for us. And we'll continue to be growing it as part of our diagnostics and software strategy.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And if I can one last quick one. I think at VMX you indicated that your total T4 slide hit about 60% ordering in its first year of launch. You are well on your way on SDMA on a slide at 42%. Do you have confidence that you can meet or exceed the T4 launch with SDMA?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I'm going to tell you, 42% within months of launch is an amazing, amazing accomplishment. And nothing happens fast in veterinary. Everything is \u2013 the adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.","We've really been fully in the market in the U.S in January. We took some preorders in the fourth quarter, but we're really just ramping up for the last four months. So I think that's a great number. And the nice thing about SDMA on the slide, as I mentioned, it actually increases the economic value of a placement of a Catalyst because it's an additional \u2013 a parameter that customers purchase.","And thus the consumable stream from a Catalyst placement goes up just like with T4. And then as I mentioned, we are going to have the SDMA T4 combo kit, which I think is another kind of subtle, but it's going to be very appreciated by our customers because then they can just drop both those in together and with a chem panel and with older dogs and cats you really want to add T4 and of course you also have a very strong case to add SDMA to that for in-house testing. So we're very pleased with that strategy.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Andrew Cooper - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a quick one from me. As we think of SediVue, kind of the placement trajectory there. Can you give us a little bit of color on what percentage of those are going to new customers versus back into the base and then on top of that, sort of what the attachment rate is relative to a new Catalyst placement there? And then lastly, if you can give us a little bit of an update if there is any changes to the pull through you have been seeing per day there that will be great? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I would say that there's not a material change to your last question in the pull-through. You would think that with exceptional value that your analysis adds to clinical insight, you would think and yet that's really to my prior point, things don't change that fast. And so where I think we've said 3,000, 4,500 in consumables per placement of SediVue.","And to your earlier \u2013 it's really all of the above. We're selling into our installed base. We're selling to customers when they buy the full suite. We're selling to customers who don't buy the full suite but maybe they're going to buy the full suite later. It's now very mature, very sophisticated instrument with huge differentiators. Of course, we've got the Pay per Run, which customers love because they don't have to buy consumable inventory in advance. We just had a very, very successful second year Free UA Day, which we can do because it's Pay per Run. We have one customer run 100 urinalysis in one day. That's a lot of urine. And that was a lot of clinical insight. And what we're finding is just like when you run a chemistry panel, there is a tremendous amount of clinical insight that you wouldn't always expect. When you run that urine, you find a lot of hidden disease and you're getting a better differential.","So the runway on \u2013 I think you're going to find that in time a practice will feel incomplete without in-house urine sediment analyzer, just as they do today in large part with chemistry, hematology, radiography. This is a core component to be able to reach the basic standard of care in veterinary medicine in the U.S. and then of course we have the whole international, which we really haven't even gotten started on yet because we're having so much success with placing Catalysts as you saw from the numbers, but following on Catalyst over the next decade we'll have a second wave with a very sophisticated urine sediment analyzer in the form of SediVue.","Andrew Cooper - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And with that gentleman, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. We're just very pleased with our organic growth of 12% driven in large part by the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue of 13%. That component of our revenue, that CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue constitutes 76% of the company's total revenue. It's a real driver, although the other parts of the company are well too. I want to certainly congratulate our Water business. It had an exceptional 12% quarter, but it is a high-single-digit organic grower with mid-40s operating margins and very little invested capital. It's really an exceptional business and our team is doing a great job there. They did a great job with the go-directs in Brazil.","And then, comparable constant currency EPS growth of 32% was driven by strong fundamentals of our revenue growth and margin expansion and further aided by the net benefits of tax reform. So I just want to congratulate the IDEXX teams around the world for their successes in Q1 and the momentum we have in the business. I think everybody is very, very excited about what we can bring back to veterinary medicine. People love their pets, Millennials love their pets even more, and we can help veterinarians take care of those pets, live long, healthy lives.","With that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service.

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning and thanks, everyone for joining us in our call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and outlook for the full year. I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2018, Jon will follow with his comments.","In terms of our results for the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $492 million or growth of 10% on a reported basis supported by 1% year-on-year benefit from foreign exchange rate changes. Organic recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth was strong in the quarter at 11% despite over 2% in combined growth headwinds from fewer equivalent days in the quarter, year-on-year changes in distributor inventory levels in international markets and natural disaster related impacts.","Overall organic growth for the quarter was 9%, below our expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% gains. The largest element of the shortfall related to the combined growth impacts noted, which lowered overall organic growth by about 2%. This was about 1% above the growth headwind we had previously projected related to fewer equivalent days heading into the quarter.","We also saw greater than expected end market pressure on our LPD business, as well as some changes in our CAG instrument program mix which resulted in relatively higher levels of deferred instrument revenues in the quarter. We'll discuss these factors in more detail as we review our quarterly performance and our revised 2017 organic growth outlook.","Despite these impacts we continue to leverage high recurring CAG revenue gains to drive strong profit flow-through keeping us on track towards our full-year EPS growth goals. Operating profits in Q3 grew 14% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis, supported by continued strong gross margin gains.","EPS for the quarter was $0.79, an increase of 27% on a reported and constant currency basis. These results included $0.03 per share of discrete benefit from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits and $0.04 per share from the adoption of new share-based compensation accounting guidance. Adjusted for these factors comparable constant currency EPS growth was 16%, on track with our goals.","Today we're refining our 2017 revenue guidance and raising our EPS outlook to reflect benefits from discrete tax items and a higher projection for full year operating margin gains. Our new revenue outlook of $1.95 billion to $1.96 billion is consistent at midpoint with our prior guidance reflecting reported growth of 10% to 10.5%. We're maintaining an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth of 12.5% to 13%, consistent with very strong year-to-date trends. We're updating our outlook for full-year organic growth of 9.5% to 10%, incorporating natural disaster related impacts, a lower projected growth rate for our LPD business, consistent with recent trends, and adjustments to our outlook for instrument revenues reflecting expectations for relatively higher levels of deferred instrument revenues this year based on our projected program mix and current accounting treatment. These impacts are fully offset by favorable FX changes. We're raising our projections for 2017 EPS to $3.22 to $3.26 per share, compared to our earlier guidance of $3.12 to $3.22 per share, or an increase of $0.07 at midpoint, including about $0.05 of per share benefit related to discrete tax items.","This updated EPS outlook equates to 18% to 20% comparable constant currency growth adjusted to exclude EPS growth benefits related to share-based compensation accounting changes and discrete tax benefits.","This outlook incorporates higher expectations for reported and constant currency operating margin gains of 130 basis points to 150 basis points this year, resulting in approximately $0.02 of operational improvement from our earlier guidance, net of refinements to our organic growth outlook.","Our updated 2017 outlook assumes $0.12 to $0.15 per share in EPS benefit from stock compensation accounting changes and $0.05 per share in discrete tax benefits, which are not expected to benefit future years. This is factored into our 2018 preliminary outlook, which we're also sharing today.","In terms of our 2018 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.14 billion to $2.18 billion and EPS of $3.50 to $3.62 per share with comparable constant currency revenue and EPS growth aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our 2018 revenue outlook reflects expectations for 9.5% to 11.5% reported revenue growth driven by 9% to 11% organic gains. As we'll discuss later in reviewing our preliminary guidance, we currently estimate that the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have an immaterial net impact on our revenue in 2018.","Our EPS outlook assumes achievement of 75 basis points to 125 basis points of improvement in operating margins on a reported and constant currency basis, approximately 25 basis points above the improvement outlook shared at our recent Investor Day.","On a comparable constant currency basis, that is adjusted to exclude share-based compensation impacts and discrete tax items, this preliminary outlook equates to 15% to 19% EPS growth compared to midpoint 2017 projections.","We'll discuss our 2017 and preliminary 2018 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Q3 performance was led by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $427 million, up 10% organically, supported by double-digit gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues and in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems businesses.","These gains were offset by relatively lower instrument revenues impacted by comparisons to strong prior year results, as well as by relatively higher levels of deferred revenue recognition, which we'll discuss in more detail as we review our product line results. Water revenues of $31 million grew 10% organically in Q3 supported by solid testing gains in the U.S. and benefits from international go-direct initiatives, which added about 3% to quarterly growth.","As noted, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 7% organically to $28 million. This was about $2 million to $3 million below our flat to modest organic growth outlook for the quarter. Recently, our LPD business has been impacted more than anticipated by end market factors that are pressuring producers that use our diagnostic tests. European deregulation of milk quotas has lowered milk pricing globally. In addition, imports of powdered milk has been increasing in China, depressing demand for local milk for consumption and for production of dairy products. Combined, these factors had the effect of lowering dairy producer demand for antibiotic testing, pregnancy testing and health herd screening for cattle.","In addition, regulations controlling pork prices in China have led to the closure of farms. And recent poultry disease outbreaks have reduced demand for live poultry, both of which have constrained growth in demand for our diagnostic tests. For our business, this has lowered revenues in our dairy testing and health herd screening businesses globally and moderated the strong growth trends we've seen in emerging markets.","While we expect these dynamics are transitory and will stabilize and improve over time, we are updating our outlook for the LPD business in the near-term to reflect continued mid-single digit declines in organic revenue growth. This results in about a $5 million of reduction to our previous LPD revenue outlook for 2017.","By region, U.S. revenues were $301 million in Q3, up 9% organically driven by continued strong recurring CAG Diagnostics gains. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues grew 11% organically in Q3, despite over 2% in growth headwind from the combined impact of fewer equivalent days in the quarter and natural disaster effects.","Gains were driven by very strong continued growth in U.S. labs, double-digit gains in consumable revenues and solid growth in rapid assay. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains continue to be primarily volume driven with overall net price gains trending in the 2% to 3% range. Overall, U.S. revenue growth was moderated by lower instrument revenues related to comparisons to strong prior results, which included benefits from SediVue backlog order fulfillment and higher levels of second Catalyst placements, as well as growth in deferred revenue related to instrument placements.","IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace continued strong U.S. veterinary practice market growth, reflecting our dataset from about 5,000 clinics. In Q3, patient visits increased 1.9% and clinic revenues increased 6%. National disaster impacts could be seen in moderated September patient visit growth of 0.9% and practice revenue growth of 4.8% compared to July and August average growth rates of 2.4% and 6.6%, respectively.","International revenues and in the third quarter were $191 million reflecting 8% organic growth, with overall gains moderated by declines in our LPD business, as nearly 90% of LPD revenues came from international markets. International results were driven by continued strong 12% recurring CAG Diagnostic organic revenue gains, despite over 2% of combined growth headwind in the quarter related to fewer equivalent days, and year-on-year changes in distributor inventory levels in certain markets. International CAG recurring growth continues to be led by robust gains in consumable revenues, reflecting ongoing rapid expansion of our Catalyst installed base.","In terms of segment performance, our Q3 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and ongoing expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally we have placed 2,738 premium analyzers in Q3, up 6% compared to prior year levels or 13% when normalizing our comparisons to adjust for prior year fulfillment of SediVue backlog orders. These results included 1,385 Catalyst placements, which were up 14% globally. We also placed 848 premium hematology instruments, 505 SediVue's, and 1,373 SNAP Pros in the quarter, bringing year-to-date SNAP Pro placements to over 4,300.","By region, we continue to achieve high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America. In Q3, we placed 292 Catalysts at competitive or greenfield accounts, in line with strong prior year levels. Competitive placements represented 80% of total North American catalyst placements, reflecting our strategic focus. We continued to see a shift in our premium instrument placements toward competitive Catalyst, SediVue and SNAP Pro in the U.S., aligned with our economic value or EVI metric which increased in the quarter on a basis adjusted for prior year SediVue backlog fulfillment.","International Catalyst momentum continues to be very strong with over 1,000 placements in the quarter, with close to half of these placements going to new and competitive accounts. Globally, competitive placements increased 19% in Q3. This progress and continued improvement in retention has supported a 21% year-on-year global expansion of our Catalyst install base to just under 28,000 units reflecting 10% year-on-year growth in North America and 36% gains in international markets.","Overall, instrument revenues declined $2 million in the quarter to $29 million compared to strong prior year results, which included fulfillment of our backlog of about 160 SediVue orders post-launch and about 80 more second Catalyst placements as part of our successful retention programs.","The implementation of our expanded sales force reconfiguration in the quarter in the U.S., which is now complete, also had a moderating effect on Q3 placement gains as we work through this change. As noted, reported revenue results in Q3 reflected an increase in levels of deferred revenue recognition related to customer program mix.","As context, in the U.S. we offer different customer programs for instrument placements with some involving deferred revenue recognition aligned with multiyear agreements, which enhance customer retention. We've seen an increase in CAG instrument placements that are tied to cross category customer commitments that include upfront payments or points. This is aligned with our expanded penetration of new instrument platforms, such as SediVue as well as with our accelerated growth in the reference lab business.","Under current accounting, instrument revenue recognition related to upfront commitments is deferred over time rather than at the time of placement, with net impacts of these commitments allocated across instrument and consumable revenues. These changes reflect a shift in the mix of deal types rather than a change in pricing dynamics and we continue to expect net price realization on related recurring revenues in the plus 2% to plus 3% range.","In addition, we expanded bundled rental programs in select international markets in Q3, which supported high levels of placement growth in these markets and also resulted in instrument revenues being recognized over time.","Our revised full-year 2017 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect our Q3 instrument revenue results and updated projections related to customer program mix resulting in a $5 million reduction to our prior full-year organic revenue growth outlook.","Growth in our instrument consumer base supported by sustained high retention levels and utilization benefits from the expansion of the Catalyst platform in international markets is driving continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumable revenues of $129 million grew 13% organically in Q3 supported by strong gains across U.S. and international markets, despite about 3% of combined growth headwind from fewer equivalent days, international distributor inventory changes and natural disaster impacts. Our SediVue installed base continues to expand and contributed 1.7% to consumable growth in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services, with revenues of $168 million also grew 13% organically in the third quarter. We estimate fewer equivalent days and natural disaster impacts reduced lab revenue growth by about 1% in Q3. Strong reference lab gains were supported by continued mid-teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. reflecting double-digit organic volume gains with existing customers, augmented by solid price realization and net customer additions. International reference lab gains were solid in the quarter with organic revenue growth at high single-digit rates driven by consistent gains in Europe.","Rapid assay revenues continued to trend well, Q3 revenues of $51 million grew 4% organically net of an estimated 4% headwind related to fewer equivalent days, international distributor inventory changes and natural disaster impacts. Rapid assay gains continue to reflect solid volume growth in 4Dx and specialty tests and progress from gaining share in first generation products in the U.S. As expected, growth moderated somewhat from high first half levels reflecting relatively less favorable comparisons related to the timing of promotional programs.","Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues were $33 million in the quarter, up 10% organically driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base and solid growth in digital radiography placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 was $100 million, up 14% or 13% adjusted for currency, with results driven by continued strong profit gains in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 20.4%, up 80 basis points on a constant currency basis. Gains were driven by continued solid gross margin gains reflecting momentum and expanding CAG recurring, diagnostic revenues, supported by moderate price gains and ongoing productivity improvement, aided by volume leverage.","For Q3, gross profit was $274 million, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. With the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we recognized $900,000 in foreign exchange hedge losses in gross profit in Q3. Overall foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 lowered quarterly operating profit by about $400,000 with no material impact on EPS.","Operating expenses grew 10% in Q3, in line with revenue growth and slightly favorable to our earlier projections as we advanced increased commercial and technology related investments in the U.S. We've now reached our staffing goals for the U.S. commercial expansion and expect year-on-year operating expense growth in the low teens range in Q4.","EPS in Q3 was $0.79 per share, including $0.03 in discrete tax benefits from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits and $0.04 per share in benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, which was about $0.01 below our expectations.","Looking forward to Q4, we are projecting an additional $0.02 in discrete tax benefit related to expected utilization of foreign tax credits and about $0.05 of benefit per share from share-based compensation impacts, which is factored into our updated 2017 outlook.","For the full year, we now expect benefits from the adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance of about $0.30 per share, which is about $0.02 below the midpoint of our last guidance estimate. Q3 EPS results were supported by share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 2.1%, net of a 0.5% negative impact related to adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance.","Our effective tax rate was 23.4% in Q3, including 4.2% of tax benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption, and 3% of benefit from the discrete foreign tax credit. Comparable constant currency EPS growth in the quarter was 16%, adjusting for share-based accounting and discrete tax effects. Free cash flow was $95 million in Q3, on track with our full-year outlook for free cash flow of about 95% of net income, and projected full year capital spending of $90 million.","In Q3 we deployed $50 million to repurchase about 300,000 shares in the open market, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $215 million for 1.4 million shares or an average price of $154 per share. We ended Q3 with $1.296 billion in debt outstanding, $454 million in cash and investment balances, and $163 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.6 times gross and 1.7 times net of cash and investment balances.","Turning to our 2017 outlook, as noted, we're refining our full-year revenue guidance and raising our EPS outlook to reflect benefits from discrete tax items and a higher projection for full-year operating margin gains. We're narrowing our reported revenue guidance range to $1.95 billion to $1.96 billion or growth of 10% to 10.5%, reflecting a consistent full-year revenue outlook at midpoint.","As noted, we're maintaining an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth of 12.5% to 13%, consistent with our strong year-to-date trends. We're updating our outlook for full-year organic revenue growth to 9.5% to 10% from earlier guidance of 10% to 11%. This updated revenue outlook incorporates expectations for full-year natural disaster related impacts of about $2 million, a lower projected growth rate for our LPD business, resulting in a $5 million reduction to our earlier outlook and a $5 million adjustment to projections for reported instrument revenues reflecting relatively higher expectations for deferred instrument revenues this year under current accounting standards.","These revenue impacts are fully offset by favorable FX changes. At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we now project that FX will have a modest favorable impact on reported full-year 2017 revenue growth and a $0.01 negative impact on EPS, primarily reflecting the lapping of 2016 hedge gains.","For the full-year 2017, we're now projecting hedge gains of approximately $1 million. Our updated full-year 2017 organic revenue outlook reflects expectations for 9% to 10% organic revenue growth in Q4, including expectations for an approximate 1% headwind related to fewer equivalent days and natural disaster related impacts.","As noted earlier, we're raising our outlook for full-year 2017 reported and constant currency operating margin improvement to 130 basis points to 150 basis points reflecting updated FX estimates.","In terms of our EPS, we're raising our 2017 outlook to $3.22 to $3.26. This guidance includes a projected $0.05 in discrete tax benefits related to the expected use of foreign tax credits and about $0.02 per share in net operational improvement driven by higher expectations for operating margins.","FX benefits of $0.02 per share relative to earlier guidance offset $0.02 of less projected benefit from share-based compensation impacts in 2017. Adjusting for share-based compensation accounting impacts and discrete tax effects, our 2017 EPS outlook equates to 18% to 20% comparable constant currency growth, at the high-end of our long-term growth plans.","We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 32% prior to benefits from share based accounting changes and discrete rate benefits. We're refining our estimate for the full year benefit from shared-based compensation accounting changes on our effective tax rate to about 7%.","This includes a projected $5 million or $0.05 per share benefit in Q4. We also project an additional 1% discrete tax benefit from expected utilization of foreign tax credits, including expected $1 million to $2 million or $0.02 per share benefit in Q4. Incorporating these factors we now estimate a full year effective tax rate for 2017 of about 23.5% and a Q4 effective tax rate of 24% to 25%.","The projections for our effective tax rate in 2017 align with an expected $27 million full year benefit from tax reduction related to share-based compensation activity. A portion of this tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors including the timing of exercises of stock options, which are not expected to carry over into future periods based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity.","For future years, we now estimate that the annual benefit from share-based compensation activity will be $13 million to $16 million, or about $0.15 to $0.18 of per share benefit, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. This means that $0.12 to $0.15 of net EPS benefit projected in 2017 is not anticipated to carry over into 2018. Combined with the discrete tax benefits recognized this year, this means that $0.17 to $0.20 per share of associated EPS benefit recognized in 2017 is not expected to carry over into future years. We've adjusted for these dynamics in our preliminary 2018 outlook.","For the full year 2017, our outlook for share count is a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of about 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. We now project net interest expense of between $32 million and $33 million.","As we look ahead to 2018, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth, consistent with our long-term goals. As noted, our preliminary revenue outlook is $2.14 billion to $2.18 billion, reflecting expectations for 9.5% to 11.5% reported revenue growth, driven by 9% to 11% organic revenue gains. Our 2018 outlook reflects expectations for sustained strong organic growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues, supported by our launches of SDMA on a slide and our Fecal antigen SNAP.","In 2018, we'll be adopting the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method. This means that we will be applying the new standard in 2018 and reflecting a cumulative adjustment to our balance sheet accounts for prior years, assuming that the standard had been in effect for those periods. Based on our analysis to-date, we estimate that the implementation of the standard will have an immaterial net impact on our overall revenue recognition in 2018. Note that this reflects in our estimate of the combined impact of the modified retroactive restatement and the change in timing of revenue recognition for 2018 activity. On balance, we expect the new standard will result in relatively earlier revenue recognition for IDEXX over time when instruments are placed, aligned with the principles of the accounting standard.","Turning to our preliminary EPS guidance for 2018, our outlook is for EPS of $3.50 per share to $3.62 per share. As noted, this outlook assumes a full year increase of 75 basis points to 125 basis points in operating margins on a reported and constant currency basis. At the rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will increase revenue growth by about 0.5% and EPS by about $0.02 per share, net of established hedge positions.","Adjusting for changes in currencies, share-based accounting benefits and discrete tax effects, this equates to a projected 15% to 19% comparable constant currency growth rate next year compared to the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance.","As noted, our 2018 outlook assumes $13 million to $16 million from share-based compensation accounting. These benefits are reflected in our projected 2018 effective tax rate of 28.5% to 29%. We're projecting to generate relatively less uplift in EPS growth from capital allocation leverage in 2018 reflecting expectations for a 1% reduction in shares outstanding and relatively higher floating interest rate costs, which contribute to current projections for a $3 million increase to interest expense next year to $35 million to $36 million. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2018 guidance in our year-end conference call.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Brian, for that detailed and fully transparent review of our Q3 results and our guidance. And as I step back, I'm very, very pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business in the third quarter, reflected in strong CAG recurring growth and expansion of our premium instrument platforms, while delivering strong margin gains, keeping us on track towards our long-term goal of 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth.","Adjusted for the factors that Brian noted, which impacted organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth by about 2%, our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 13% in the U.S. and 14% international, reflecting the robust durable momentum in expanding our annuity base, driving strong profit flow-through and positioning us for continued strong financial performance in 2018.","A key initiative we are advancing to sustain our enduring CAG recurring revenue growth is our enhanced commercial capability in the U.S., an expansion which we completed at the beginning of Q3. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have moved beyond the expected transition impacts to sales productivity, as the new IDEXX representatives begin to build experience and develop their relationships with customers. Even during this transition quarter in the U.S. we saw growth in the EVI of our instrument placements, adjusting for last year's delivered SediVue against preexisting backlog.","The Q4 trends, though early, suggest patterns in the past still apply with a jump in productivity as the new reps build on their customer relationships and move to commission-based compensation for instrument placements. Instrument unit placements were strong in Q3, supported by 19% global growth in placements of competitive and greenfield Catalyst chemistry analyzers. In international, we had a record quarter of Catalyst placements in Q3 and also a record quarter of total premium instrument placements in the quarter. Continue to expand our instrument customer base around the globe.","Our customer retention rates for U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues remain at exceptional levels of 97% to 98% for reference labs and instrument consumables respectively. And in fact, trends in Q3 continued to show further modest improvement in both modalities. Customer retention rates internationally for reference lab instrument consumables are even higher, at 98% to 99%, demonstrating the unique and irreplaceable value of our innovations in the eyes of our customers.","While we were disappointed in our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy Q3 revenues, this business has historically been more volatile. It remains an important part of our portfolio with this proprietary line of animal health diagnostics and leveraging the same technologies that we use in our companion animal business.","Our Water business had an outstanding quarter of 10% organic growth and 47% operating margin. In addition, Water had two favorable regulatory developments that bode well for growth in the next several years, one in the U.S. market for wastewater and one in the European market for drinking water.","In the new product pipeline, we continue to make good progress in the planned launch of two exceptionally strategic tests, Catalyst SDMA in the next few months, and SNAP Fecal DX in mid-2018. The enthusiasm for our Catalyst customers for SDMA is exceptionally high as we continue to build the franchise for this unique and proprietary kidney function marker as an essential element of the chemistry panel, whether run in-house on Catalyst or sent out to the IDEXX reference labs. SDMA has the benefit of a growing number of third-party studies and the impact of almost 12 million patient samples run in our reference labs over the past two plus years. SNAP Fecal DX will build on IDEXX's proprietary Fecal antigen technology, that we now offer in our reference labs, and itself is a meaningful driver of growth of same-customer volumes in our North American labs.","We have an attractive pipeline of new product development resulting from our over $100 million annual investment in R&D, that will generate future product launches, a pipeline that remains as attractive as ever, even beyond Catalyst, SDMA and SNAP Fecal. The pipeline includes instruments, menu, veterinary software, artificial intelligence and Big Data capabilities.","In the latter two technologies, we have over 250 employees in software R&D focused on expanding the capabilities of our existing cloud and client server-based software offerings as well as the Big Data opportunities.","Also included here is the further advancement of our cloud-based VetConnect PLUS, a platform that adds unique and growing value to our diagnostic offerings worldwide. The combination of our innovation and expanded commercial strategies gives us confidence for our 2018 guidance of 9% to 11% organic revenue growth, and as Brian mentioned, the 75 basis point to 125 basis point expansion in constant currency operating margin.","So with that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color commentary thus far. I was hoping to dive a little bit more into the delta and your assumptions behind revenue recognition for the instruments. And my curiosity is that driven by a change in the instrument sales mix that you're seeing towards different products, is it more bundling or is it kind of a novel program, or end market response to the competition, just any more color what's driving that delta?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. It is basically a change in the mix of previously established programs. Programs can have different kinds of revenue recognition. We are focused on, particularly the metric, economic value index, and we see those holding steady. And I think we've given the results there, the 19% growth in Catalyst placements at new competitive accounts, the EVI that's up in North America despite the Q3 transitions. So, I think the fundamentals of the instrument placement are strong and the revenues are a reflection of program mix. Brian, you have further comment?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. As Jon said, it's existing programs and more an evolution that we've seen relatively more growth than we were projecting earlier. And I tried to note that we also had some growth in international markets, we have rental programs in emerging markets which are doing quite well, and that also results in very good placements, great EVI, but you don't recognize the revenue upfront. So...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. And in Q3 we had one country that started one of those programs that we've had in other markets to exceptional success. But it's a program that doesn't have upfront instrument revenue.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So the placements were good, but the mix and how that flows through instrument revenue was somewhat different than we anticipated, and we tried to flow that through for the full year and make an adjustment there.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then, I don't recall you talking about international distributor changes in the past kind of impacting performance. So is that just normal fluctuation in distributor inventory, are you seeing different ways that they operationalize their inventory trying to shrink lead times, or seeing less end market demand, or anything else we should read into that, or is that just a normal?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It really is, we \u2013 when we went direct in the U.S., we actually stopped normalizing because we had relatively immaterial impacts from this, it's primarily Japan actually. And it just so happened that the year-over-year changes because it's not just this year, it's also what happened last year, was large enough that it kind of had an impact on the growth rate we wanted to highlight. So what we're really trying to note is that the underlying growth when you normalize for hurricanes and these changes in days if you look at the growth rate in the \u2013 as Jon mentioned in international, it's 14%, in the U.S....","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","In the CAG.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","...13%, we feel very good about the underlying CAG recurring Diagnostics recurring growth, and wanted to make sure we noted that, so people understand those trends.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. I think your underlying operating margin improvement is slightly higher than what you were alluding to at Investor Day. How \u2013 I guess for 2018, how should we think about sort of that difference, how much of it is attributable to FX and broadly can you speak to maybe the drivers of that metric into 2018? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It primarily flows from the strong momentum we're having, growing the CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. So we're, as noted reinforced 12.5% to 13% organic growth rate this year and we're looking to sustain that into next year and we have some drivers like SDMA on a slide and Fecal Antigen that will help with that and growth in that part of our revenue stream has really nice gross margins...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And we're getting 2% to 3% pricing, which is a demonstration of the unique value we're bringing, by the way, it's at constant currency, so none of that is FX related, the 75 basis point to 125 basis point expansion in operating margin would be in a constant currency.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And how should we think about the quarterly progression of SediVue placements, do you anticipate placing a, I guess increasing amount into 2018? And can we get an update on the consumables utilization there, is it tracking better than kind of maybe your initial expectations there? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I think, we had a very good quarter in SediVues. I think we gave guidance, we did 505. We gave guidance to over 2,000 for the year, I think we're well on track for that. We would \u2013 SediVue is going exceptionally well. We're going to launch the next version of the algorithmic software called Neural Network 3.0 in January, Erin. 2.0 really was an exceptional success that we launched in April of this year. But we're going to get the benefit of over 50 million images now.","So, and one interesting thing about urine, it's really important to understand this, is that, if you don't take a picture of the urine when it's fresh, I'm talking about within the first half hour of coming out of the bladder, it changes. I mean, bacteria grows or disappears, crystals dissolve, I mean, you've got to \u2013 the algorithm has to be run on fresh urine and of course one of the benefits of SmartService is we have tens of millions of images. So Neural Network 3.0 is just going to take it to a whole new level. And of course every single SediVue customer will receive that through a SmartService update in January. So, I think we have a good momentum. On the utilization. We're seeing very, very small increases, but we're still really in the 3,000 to 4,500 and maybe a little bit of that, very small modest increase in that.","And of course, our goal through things like the free UA day that we can do with the pay per run is to get customers to grow utilizations. It's kind of a shocker that urine is used so little in diagnostics when it provides so much value, but I think that's going to be a long-term trend.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just a question, you're on the \u2013 how much in year 2018 organic revenue growth guidance, is that benefiting from deferred revenues that were pushed out from 2017 to 2018, just trying to get a sense? And can you just give us an idea on what the recognition timelines you're looking at on those, are you're talking about recognition over one-year, two-year? Just a little bit more color on sort of, are you getting pushes from 2017 to 2018 and just sort of the numbers involved?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So that is all captured in the \u2013 we're transitioning to the new revenue accounting standard, Derik.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","In 2018.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","In 2018 and that is all captured in what we reflected as a net immaterial change overall. To give you a sense of this, the things that we talked about, we talked about bundle programs deferred revenue, associated with upfront points and payments. Under the new accounting standard that actually is primarily recognized upfront. So, under the modified retroactive restatement though we're going to have to treat the past as if we were using the new statement in the past. So it \u2013 we're really going \u2013 it gets complicated because we have three different programs, major programs that all have kind of differing changes to them. The net of what comes out of the wash of all that is we don't necessarily see a net material change one way or the other.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And let me also answer your question, typically you either recognize the revenue upfront in one type of program or you basically recognize instrument revenue over a five-year to six-year period. There's no in between. It's not like you recognize it in the second year. It's either amortized or it's upfront.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So, that's captured in our 9% to 11% and what I did note is, over time in the future, the standard will lead to probably relatively more upfront revenue recognition, which is given the mix of programs that we have.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, that's really helpful. And I guess \u2013 I may have missed this, but can you \u2013 did you say anything about how you see the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business trending in 2018? don't think you can gave any specific segment comments. If I missed them, my apologies.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think \u2013 no we didn't and we haven't given segment guidance in 2018. But we believe that the factors in LPD are transitory in the second half of 2017. I think that's still a solid \u2013 it remains a very solid business with a favorable return on invested capital. And so, we would not expect that to be a longer term factor.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if I can sneak in one final one, the share count \u2013 the share buyback is a little bit lower for next year, it's a little bit \u2013 some color on that?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We're trending right now at about $50 million a quarter and we are \u2013 our outlook for next year anticipates continuing in that range. We think that's \u2013 we feel good about the value of the company and I think we \u2013 it supports continued deployment towards repurchases. We are at a somewhat moderated level from where we've been historically and that's reflected in that outlook.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","What is not reflected is any change in our free cash flow. As Brian said, our free cash flow to net income for the guidance for 2017 is 95%.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. First one, Brian, for you. Why the increase in the op margin expansion guidance relative to the Analyst Day two months ago? Maybe if you can give some color there, and just even maybe more importantly, considering the spend was supposed to be higher in the near-term, is the new long-term op margin expansion guidance, sort of that 75 bps to 125 bps per annum, versus that prior 50 bps to 100 bps plus? And I've got a follow up.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","As, Jon, I mentioned earlier I think the growth in CAG recurring Diagnostics revenues and the continued solid price realization we're getting there is supporting very good gross margin improvement and we're building that into the outlook next year. We're not changing our longer term view on the margin potential of business, it's just the preliminary view for next year.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Right. And I would also say, one of the things that we do between August and this point in time in the late fall, is we build together, we build our plans for \u2013 operating plans for 2018, as we built our plans for 2018, we really saw solid margin opportunity that gave us the confidence for next year of 75 basis points to 125 basis points of margin expansion. And it's going to be primarily gross margin. A lot of good things happening in the gross margin, 2% to 3% net prices is one of them, but favorables on labs and instrument consumables, but so, I mean, as we as we kind of rolled everything together, that gave us the confidence to tweak it up by 25 basis points for 2018.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Understood. I guess what I don't understand is, unless some of that spend was deferred, you would think that new higher rate would carry forward in subsequent years. Again, Brian, based on your prior commentary that the most heightened level of expense was targeted for 2018. But I can follow-up with you offline there?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, we're obviously going to be growing off of higher bases as we move forward, Jon. So, I think we'll continue to look at that, but we're comfortable with the longer-term guidance of 50 bps to 100 bps.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I was going to say, Jon, because you asked for it, but no, it was really the fundamentals of...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Exactly.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I appreciate that, Jon. And then, just to shift gears, maybe Jon for you. Any change on the color, the exact timing of SDMA on the slide, in other words, next few months to me sounds slightly different than year end, is that a true assumption? And then the international lab was up high single digits. That's a good number, but it is down from the low double-digit range, even mid-teens that you guys had gotten too. I know there was a day adjustment, but that wouldn't account for 300 bps or 400 bps or even 500 bps, so maybe you can talk to what you're seeing in the international reference lab? Thanks, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. First of all, we're very excited. We're in the short strokes on the SDMA on the slide launch. We now have it out with Catalyst customers that are running the slide in practice and producing results and providing data in the care of patients. That's the last step in our development timeline, and just as we get to this level, we always want to make sure that we launch it right. So, we're very comfortable with the next few months timeframe for that.","I think what I would say about the reference lab business is, we're \u2013 I think we're pleased with the growth international. I think we're exceptionally pleased with the success of the international had with instrument placements, which are very profitable business model for us and in turn we're very pleased with the continued growth in the U.S. and Canadian reference lab business, which is also demonstrating nice profit flow-through, allowing us to support our profit guidance for 2018 and 2019.","So, I think these are, what we're seeing is growth in the profitable areas of the recurring revenue around the world, that's a little differential. But I mean, I don't think the reference to the growth in international reference lab, that Brian mentioned, is anything to sneeze at; obviously these are very good numbers. But I think it was a particularly good quarter for instrument placements internationally.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for all the color. Just two for me. First, just in terms of any sort of flagging associated with kind of the cadence of 2018 earnings growth, certainly some of the new products kind of build through the year, so just wanted to \u2013 I know it's early, but any sort of thoughts on how we should be thinking about the ramp associated with A, the new products and B, the timing of kind of the margin leverage?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think it's early for us to be projecting that. I think one thing I would note is obviously we've had some increase in our OpEx base as we staff up in the U.S. and advance some of the U.S. commercial organization and advance some of the IT initiatives, so that'll carry over into the early part of next year in terms of year-on-year growth. But I think we'll wait until we kind of complete our detailed budget processes before we get into that.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I think these new products, like SDMA on a slide, it's going to be helpful on the margin, I actually think we're getting the benefit of SDMA on a slide now, because customers are anticipating it. So it's benefiting things like the retention rates, that I mentioned that are continuing to improve modestly, and the placement rate in anticipation. So the multiplier effect on the SDMA on a slide is pretty significant and is embedded, of course, in our expectations for overall recurring revenue growth. And then there's also a multiplier effect on SNAP Fecal, which we are very comfortable with a mid-2018 launch.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful color. And then just thinking about the operating expense budget forecasted for 2018, over the last couple of years, you've made some pretty targeted investments in the U.S. commercial infrastructure; and just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about the sales force potentially being further expanded in light of these new innovations that are coming to the market? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. I think that's a great question. We're very pleased with the expansion that we put in place and really had the bulk of the costs in Q3 already embedded in the P&L. And as I mentioned, now they're go through that one quarter of transition that's associated with territory changes and rep changes, which positions us very well, not only for Q4, for 2018. We're at 435 \u2013 that's field-based sales professionals, sales and support professionals. I think we're really in a great position \u2013 that is the largest and deepest sales organization in the companion animal market across all of companies, including pharma. And I think we're in a good place for that. I think 2018 will be an opportunity to leverage our investments both, of course, not only in people but also IT that supports that.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Going back to our Investor Day guidance though, for 2018, the margin improvement that we're signaling will be more gross margin driven. So we are going to have some carryover impacts from the investments.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great. If I can just squeeze one more in on the tax rate for 2018. It does seem, even if you strip out some of the noise this year, maybe a little bit higher than the Street was modeling. Remind us, maybe is it just mix factors in terms of the U.S. growing so strongly? But just any thoughts on kind of what the longer-term tax rate we should be thinking about in 2018 and beyond? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It actually is the same underlying tax rate of 32% before our estimates for the share-based compensation activity. So I'm not sure how the external views were factoring that in, but that's effectively what it is, it's the 32% before the benefit of the $13 million to $16 million that we signaled.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for all the color, as always.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. And I appreciate a lot of commentary on the call. I guess I wanted to just follow-up on the instrument dynamic in the quarter. Obviously, you called out changes in program mix. I think some of us are still trying to understand the economic value index, my understanding is that one of the areas of that is to promote competitive Catalyst placements. That number was pretty good in the quarter. So I guess I'm really trying to get to the bottom of what constituted the expanded bundling in the quarter that really contributed to the bulk of the change in program mix.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Just thank you for that observation, I'll let Brian answer on the accounting, which is complex, and of course will even change next year. But we're very pleased with the 19% growth in competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements that we had globally and the 14% overall growth in Catalyst placements.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, we saw relatively more cross CAG placements, which I think reflect actually the focus of the sales organization. It was relatively more than we had projected, but it's bundling of SediVues and lab deals with competitive Catalyst placements relative of single placements that may be associated with something like a rebate program. So, it was a relative change in mix that at the end of the day is very positive for the long-term growth of the company and the company's revenues and the recurring revenue base, but does have an effect just in terms of the current accounting that we don't recognize that upfront, and so that was...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","But over the life of the contract, five years, six years.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. And I might have missed it. But, do you envision the possibility of getting back to double-digit growth in instruments for 2018?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's early for us to get in...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Are you talking about in revenues?","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","For CAG instrument revenue? Yeah.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's too early for us to be getting down into the modality views. But, I think what we've signaled in the past that it's more about sustaining high levels of instrument placements and that the bigger driver of our growth is going to be growth in the recurring.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. The primary purpose of instrument placements is to drive the very profitable recurring revenue up. That's not only instrument consumables, but of course can apply also to reference labs and rapid assay, all the components of the CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. So instruments is a means towards an end, and that end is profitable recurring revenue, which, as you know, is close to three-quarters of the total company's revenue.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Excellent. If I can sneak this one in. Jon, you talked about new opportunities in artificial intelligence and Big Data opportunities. Can you speak if that is something that would tie into some of the capabilities you've already built at IDEXX or is this something that you're working on that would provide a completely new, maybe a new architecture or ecosystem?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, no. I think one of the benefits of the ecosystem \u2013 the answer is the former; it will enhance and leverage the ecosystem that we already have. It allows us to do exceptional work in retrospective analysis, which advances medical insight, it allows our reps to be more productive. There is a lot of multiplier effect and it's been a focus of our R&D and other folks. And I think you saw some of that at the Analyst Day, when we talked about the number of clinical visits that has a chemistry panel is only 13%, which is pretty low. And by the way, it's higher for our customers than it is for the market as a whole, but still the opportunity to grow the standard of care by helping customers appreciate where they stand versus their peers, we think could be a long-term growth driver. That's just one of the many examples that the AI and Big Data. Another example is just the Neural Network 3.0 that we're going to launch in January I mentioned earlier, Mark, on SediVue, we continue to see advancements inside of our products.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks so much. So not to belabor the instrument number, I know that's been too much maybe of a focus of this call, but I have noticed that instrument revenues have \u2013 they've missed me for three quarters and year-over-year has been challenging for the last, let's say two quarters. So has this mix been actually something that you've seen for a couple quarters and maybe are just calling out now or is this maybe a mix that you've seen a little bit more in focus this particular quarter and something that you're calling out now because it's something that we should definitely be aware of on a go forward basis?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I'd say relative to our goals, we've been performing very well in terms of instrument placement. So just to reinforce, the premium analyzer growth was 6% in the quarter, it was up 13% when you adjust for the prior year backlog orders and we've grown our Catalyst base globally 21% year-on-year. So, we feel very good how we're doing on instrument placements.","In terms of the mix and how that flows through our accounting. We've seen relatively more bundle placements that result in deferred instrument revenues and we're adjusting that in this year's number, and in total that's a $5 million revenue number for this year, which under new accounting going forward will be less of an impact.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And just a reminder on that question, because, David, I know, there's lot of moving parts on revenue recognition. We introduced a very successful new program in Japan actually, and it really helped accelerate very attractive economic value placements, but it moved from upfront revenue recognition of the historical way we placed programs, to in this 2017 revenue accounting world, to a deferred recognition. So, that was one of the factors, really something where we \u2013 that was new (01:00:25).","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Just don't want to lose sight of that supported the over 1,000 placements of international Catalysts in the quarter. So we're doing great on placing instruments and the mix is a little different, and we're trying to reflect that in the estimates.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. That was a 35% growth in Catalyst placements internationally in Q3. Pretty attractive.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, definitely. You guys have definitely beat me on the instrument placement numbers by quite a lot. So actually can you talk about maybe on the utilization, on the Catalyst as we move internationally, just for sake of our models, how should we look at Catalyst utilization on the per as you become, as Catalyst moves more and more as a percent of your installed base outside the U.S.?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'd say that's an excellent question. As we've talked about in the past, the typical utilization of a Catalyst placement outside the U.S. is going to be less than the utilization of a Catalyst placement inside the U.S. On the other hand, while we make a big deal about the new and competitive, when we upgrade VetTests outside the U.S., we usually see a larger bump than we would have historically seen in the U.S. We're not upgrading too many VetTests in the U.S. anymore because there aren't many left. But there are VetTest upgrade opportunities, most of the Catalyst placements that are not new competitive internationally are VetTest upgrades and they support the very strong recurring revenue growth that we've seen.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We've seen nice uplift on the international average utilization as we're upgrading. So, it's been definitely supporting our outlook.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Upgrade from VetTest to Catalyst. So that's a favorable dynamic internationally.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","That's a couple of questions. And I'll take a couple more offline, so I'm just going to do one more for sake of time. So, on the reference lab, your primary competitor has now been fully incorporated into a larger private company. Can you talk about changes that you've seen competitively, not necessarily in terms of competitive wins and losses, but just in terms of shift in the way that they're marketing or maybe going against you, or any sort of color on competitive dynamics as this integration takes place or has taken place?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","The thing I would say there, it really \u2013 there remains a very competitive market. It has been a competitive market, I expect it will be a competitive market, but I think one of the interesting things that we've seen in the U.S. market for IDEXX is, we're getting double-digit volume growth in same customers' volume. That is volume growth, that's being driven by things like the Fecal antigen test and by SDMA and that is, along with price and net new customer wins, but double-digit, over 10% growth in same-store volume is helping us with very favorable reference lab growth in the U.S. market. So I don't see really any change in the competitive environment.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the questions. I'll take the rest offline.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Haynor with Aegis Capital. Your line is open.","Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. First off for me on the bundled rental programs that you've seen success with in the emerging markets and now it sounds like starting to see some success in Japan. Is there a plan to expand those into more of the developed world or how do you see those programs evolving over time?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I don't \u2013 I think we always look at what is the most favorable scenario where we can place instruments with very profitable economic value and sometimes it's an upfront placement where we recognize revenue, and sometimes it's another placement. And what's going to confuse everything is in 2018, the revenue standards change, as Brian took you through in the prepared comments. But we are always keeping an eye on the economics of these placements. And we believe that creates long-term shareholder value and we really aren't as concerned about the revenue recognition, that's accounting, it's important that we do that correctly, but what creates value is the net present value of the placement over a five year to seven year period of time","Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.","Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then lastly for me, is the shift amongst the deal types that you've seen in your view more of a function of increased promotion of certain types of deals by your sales force or is it a function of shifts in the preferences of veterinary practices?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I think what happens is sometimes practices respond to one type of \u2013 they're not particularly \u2013 I mean I don't think they took managerial accounting in vet school. And so, sometimes one type of program just appeals them more than another, it works for them, but it also works for us. The economic value of these programs isn't very different by one type or another and isn't different by those that that we recognize revenue on upfront and those that we recognize revenue for the instrument placement over time. It's just not different, but sometimes we'll see trends on how customers respond. And our job is to place instruments in customers in an economically attractive fashion.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I do think the growth in cross CAG deals aligns with the connectivity that we are bringing to vet practices and the value that they see in having a full set of solutions from IDEXX. So, that's very much (01:06:27).","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That's an excellent point, Brian. We're not just talking about placements of instruments, of course we're growing the reference lab business. SDMA really merges the two. We had SDMA in the reference labs, now customers say, well I also run my chemistry in-house, I want SDMA on the in-house. So, really is \u2013 we call it one business the CAG diagnostics with different modalities, modes of delivering that value. And we're continuing to see growth in the percentage of customers who use both in-house and reference lab as \u2013 with the base being those who use one or the other or both, we're continuing to see growth in that cross-selling that we've talked about in past investor meetings. And yet we've still got \u2013 we're still below 50%. So we've got a lot of runway to go there.","Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay. With that, we will conclude the call. We appreciate everybody's attention and we look forward to reporting our year-end results in January.","Operator","Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","With that, I'll conclude the call and huge thanks to all of our employees who have worked very hard to deliver these results and to deliver exceptional value for our customers. It's interesting, our customers actually grow faster than the market as a whole. And I think that's the result of the great work on innovation and commercial efforts that we have around the world. So with that we'll conclude the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning, everyone. Today I'll take you through our first quarter results and spend some time reviewing our updated financial outlook for the full year. Jon will follow with his comments and observations.","We had a solid start to the year in Q1. In terms of highlight our first-quarter revenues were $382 million, up 6% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind in Q1 resulting in a 6% year-on-year reduction in reporter growth. These changes reduced year-on-year operating profit by over $5 million or about $0.01 per share more than originally projected. Despite these impacts, we delivered EPS results of $0.98 per share on Q1, reflecting 18% year-on-year gains on a constant currency basis.","Results were supported by strong organic growth and better than expected operating margins. Normalized organic revenue growth in Q1 was 11.4% and recurring CAG diagnostic gains were nearly 14%, supported by continuous strong growth in VetLab consumables and reference lab services across our U.S. and international markets.","Instrument placements were very strong in the quarter. Worldwide premium placements increased 24%, reflecting 35% growth in Catalyst instruments and 13% growth in premium hematology. Globally, we achieved 925 Catalyst placements, including 425 in North America, with a significant backlog heading into Q2.","While we posted high organic growth results in Q1, revenue gains fell below our raised growth expectations. Overall growth was constrained by tough weather conditions across much of the U.S. in the quarter. While consumable and reference lab sales remained strong, rapid assay results were below expectations reflecting lower sales of first-generation lines, that is, feline and single test canine products. Lower than expected revenues in our digital imaging business also moderated overall growth.","Looking forward, we're recalibrating our 2015 financial outlook to reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce revenue by an additional $15 million and EPS by $0.05 per share in 2015 compared to rates used to calculate our original 2015 guidance shared on our January earnings call. We're also revising our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1.5% to 12% to 13% to reflect Q1 results, expectations for moderate organic declines before margin capture benefits in our rapid assay business and revenue impacts from a transition in our Information Management business towards an increased focus on cloud-based services.","Along with FX impacts, this revised outlook will lower our 2015 EPS outlook to $4.14 to $4.24 per share this year. We'll walk through our updated guidance in more detail later in my comments.","Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance. We achieved solid organic growth across our major business segments in Q1. Global CAG revenues were $325 million, reflecting 13% normalized organic growth or 9% growth excluding benefits from U.S. go-direct margin capture, driven by continued strong gains in instrument consumable and reference lab sales.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue grew 3% organically to $31 million, benefiting from growth in new products and overall gains in Asia-Pacific, which offset an expected moderate decline in European bovine sales. Our Water business also continued its solid gains, growing 6% organically to $22 million, reflecting continued new business inroads across major regions.","Overall, U.S. revenues were $235 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, or 8% excluding margin capture benefits. U.S. gains were supported by normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 15%, or 8% growth excluding margin capture benefits, reflecting continued high growth in instrument consumable and reference lab sales, which offset lower practice level sales and rapid assay.","IDEXX's performance continues to outpace solid continued U.S. market growth, reflected in our broadened data set of 5,100 clinics. In Q1, patient visits increased 3.4% and clinic revenues increased 6.7% compared to the soft overall market results in Q1 of 2014.","International revenues in the first quarter were $147 million, supported by 9% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 11% in international markets in Q1, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions. As noted, global instrument placements were excellent in the quarter, driving 19% organic growth in instrument revenues to $20 million.","U.S. premium instrument replacements increased 15% with an estimated 59% of Catalyst placements going to competitive and greenfield accounts. International premium instrument placements increased 32% supported by the European launch of Catalyst One. We also placed 291 VetTest Chemistry Analyzers in international markets, expanding our foothold in smaller clinics.","Strong placement gains set a foundation for continued strong growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues were $279 million in Q1, up 14% organically, or about 9% excluding benefits from go-direct margin capture.","By modality, instrument consumable revenues of $98 million grew 22% normalized in Q1 or 13% excluding margin capture benefits. We saw continued strong gains across regions. In the U.S., we're expanding our penetration of premium analyzers, including solid continued growth in our Catalyst installed base, which now drives 93% of our consumable revenues exclusive of corporate accounts. This supported continued strong growth in consumable revenues well ahead of U.S. market growth rates.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $123 million grew organically 12% in the first quarter. High growth continued across all our major regions including double-digit volume driven gains in the U.S. despite weather challenges. We expect strong continued growth in lab revenues going forward as we leverage our expanded commercial capability and benefits from our test menu expansion including SDMA.","Continued high growth in consumable and lab revenues help to offset softer than expected performance on a couple of fronts in Q1. Rapid assay revenues increased 6% normalized in Q1 to $44 million. Excluding benefits from U.S. margin capture, rapid assay revenues declined about 3% in the quarter. In addition to impacts from tough weather conditions in the U.S., we experienced greater revenue declines than expected in our first-generation SNAP products. These impacts offset solid volume gains in our core canine SNAP 4Dx Plus and specialty test products, which make up the majority of our rapid assay revenues.","Based on our Q1 results and our assessment of these trends, we're lowering our full year 2015 outlook for rapid assay revenues by about $15 million, below our earlier projections for low to mid-single digit growth before benefits from margin capture, to reflect expectations for mid-single digit declines in rapid assay sales this year, before an estimated 11% growth benefit from margin capture. Jon will talk more about dynamics in this area in his comments.","Our digital business also fell short of growth goals in Q1 as a result of both increased levels of deferred revenue deals associated with bundled business commitments and the impact of new territory alignments with our expanded diagnostic sales reps. These impacts limited overall Information Management and Digital Imaging System revenues to $26 million in the quarter, or 3% organic growth, despite solid gains in Information Systems.","We're also recalibrating our full year growth outlook to reflect expectations for more moderate revenue gains in Digital Imaging this year, as well as to reflect revenue impacts related to an accelerated transition towards a subscription-based software-as-a-service model in Information Management. We expect this will result in reported IM and Digital revenue growth of 5% to 10% this year, below our earlier estimates of 15%-plus gains.","Despite these pressures and additional FX headwinds, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Operating profit was $73 million, up 4%. Excluding currency impacts, operating profits increased 12%. Operating margins of 19% were better than expected, primarily reflecting timing and management of operating expenses in the quarter.","Gross profit was $216 million in Q1, up 7% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins increased modestly, benefited from lower product costs. Foreign exchange hedge gains reporting gross profit were $4.5 million, or $0.07 per share in Q1. Operating expenses increased 8% in Q1 reflecting planned increases in capabilities supporting the U.S. go-direct strategy and global increases in commercial spending, in part reflecting stepped-up investments advanced in the second half of 2014.","EPS was $0.98 per share, up 10% on a reported basis and 18% adjusting for higher than expected currency impacts. EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year, which reduced average share count year-on-year by nearly 9%. In Q1, we repurchased over 859,000 shares for $134 million.","We ended Q1 with $1.05 billion in debt outstanding, including $150 million of new term debt issuance funded in February. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change, were 2.8 times gross and 2.0 times net of $320 million in cash and investment balances at quarter-end, in line with our long-term target range.","Looking ahead, we're updating our full-year guidance today. We're adjusting our 2015 revenue guidance range to $1.60 to $1.62 billion to reflect an additional $15 million of currency headwind at current rates, and our revised outlook for 12% to 13% normalized organic revenue growth. This outlook reflects expectations for 14% to 15% normalized growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues.","At the exchange rates shown in our press release, we now estimate that effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by about 6% and adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.27 per share, or about $0.05 per share more than estimated at the time of our January earnings call.","Please note that our 2015 profit outlook benefits from about $22 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains for previously established contracts, which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to about $0.33 per share in after-tax EPS benefit. At current rates and timing of hedge contracts, we will not have the benefit of these hedge gains in 2016.","We're adjusting the 2015 EPS outlook to $4.14 to $4.24 to reflect the incremental FX impacts and the net flow-through effects of our revised organic growth outlook. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 11% to 13% growth, but above 2014 adjusted EPS levels, which included $.065 per share benefit from the extension of the R&D tax credit.","With our updated outlook for FX impacts, we now expect modest year-on-year declines in full year 2015 operating margins compared to 2014 levels adjusted for transition impacts. Other elements of our FX profit outlook are basically consistent with our prior guidance, including expectations for an effective tax rate of about 30%. Please note that our 2015 tax rate outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit.","We're also updating our free cash flow outlook to 80% to 90% of net income to reflect expectations for relatively higher capital spending levels of about $100 million this year, driven in part by a capacity expansion in our labs business and in our manufacturing operations in support of business growth.","For Q2, we expect reported and normalized organic revenue growth to be relatively consistent with Q1, with operating margins down 50 to 100 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting timing of spending and FX impacts. We expect our organic revenue growth rates to improve as we work through the year, reflecting the benefit of the maturation of our expanded direct commercial organization in the U.S. and the rollout of new product introductions, including our T4 addition to our Catalyst profile and the additions of SDMA and fecal antigen to our reference lab offering in the second half.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you, Brian. In the first quarter of the year, we achieved strong performance across broad areas of the IDEXX portfolio. We're seeing strong market validation that our Catalyst One is the global blockbuster that we had hoped. In addition, we expect that an important group of true diagnostic innovations that have been years in the making \u2013 SDMA, T4, expanded fecal antigens and a new urine analyzer \u2013 will be introduced to the market in the next 12 months.","However, we also face some new competitive headwinds this quarter in the U.S. rapid assay market that has impacted us at a time when we are perfecting our new direct sales model. Our products compete favorably with these new products in terms of test accuracy and integration; however, it is proving to take time to demonstrate these differences and reach veterinary practices with this message. I'll speak more about this later.","Despite these impacts in one part of our rapid assay business, we remain on track for strong normalized organic growth of 12% to 13%, including 14% to 15% CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues growth. We had \u2013 we are well-positioned for strong sustained organic growth in quarters and years ahead. So let's talk about areas of progress supporting this momentum, starting with Catalyst One.","Our 35% growth in Catalyst placements globally were helped by our international operations which achieved 66% increase in Catalyst chemistry analyzer placements. Europe placements grew over 100%. We benefited from both the launch of Catalyst One in Europe and very strong commercial performance in almost every international country.","In Italy, for example, we placed an incredible 81 Catalyst analyzers in three months. And we have yet to launch Catalyst One in Asia-Pacific and Latin America geographies which will take place in Q2 and Q3. Catalyst One is proving to be the winning product for all geographies globally.","We now have over 1,200 Catalyst One's in the field since the launch in Q4 and the performance of this product is virtually flawless, reflecting our deep experience in instrument development. We now have a direct in-country commercial presence for our CAG business in all major international country markets. The practice, education and reach accomplished by our well-trained and medically sophisticated sales professionals is showing signs of paying off with these outstanding early results.","In the North America CAG market, we completed the transition to the expanded sales structure and new territory mapping in the U.S. Note that this involved adding 50 new sales professionals as we expanded from 125 to 175 sales territories. With these territory design changes, 9,000 out of 23,000 covered customers have a different veterinary diagnostic consultant representative than they did in Q4.","While we expect these new relationships will take time to mature, we still achieved excellent gains in instrument placements and consumable growth in the U.S. while we're in the early stages of our new model. We also saw 59% of our instrument placements come from competitive and greenfield accounts in Q1, very close to a record. I expect this competitive and greenfield placement level to continue to be impressive in future quarters as new and competitive customers come to appreciate that Catalyst One is cost-effective next-generation analyzer that leapfrogs their practices, medical capabilities and economic success.","We also saw strong continued reference lab growth in U.S. The expanded sales team is timely and effective in discussing the benefits of our reference lab, including our recently announced reference lab innovations \u2013 SDMA and fecal antigen \u2013 topics of keen interest to veterinarians.","We also note from experience that after a realignment of territories, the field sales organization deepens relationships in their new territories and the new reps that are added to the company move through the learning curve. Our sales performance thus accelerates each quarter. Our experience with our salesforce transformation that was put in place in Q3 of 2013, saw a progression of increased performance each quarter thereafter. With a strong base of performance already in Q1 of 2015 in the first quarter of the expansion in territory alignment, we fully expect this same dynamic going forward.","While overall organic growth continues to be strong, we are recalibrating our growth outlook for the rapid assay modality. As Brian mentioned, certain first-generation product lines within our rapid assay diagnostic modality faced new competition in 2015 that is impacting the overall revenue growth of this modality. These first-generation IDEXX products made up of our feline retrovirus SNAPs, canine heartworm single-line analyte SNAPs and certain smaller volume single analyte canine products have a level of differentiation, be it accuracy or integration, that is more subtle and thus a greater competitive risk as we refine our new sales model.","In addition, these lines are also purchased by the vast majority of veterinary practices in the U.S., including customers where these are the only IDEXX products that they buy. Thus, we require different ways of marketing and we are learning to communicate more effectively to this broad group of customers by augmenting our field sales organization with other channels such as our inside sales professionals.","Nonetheless, we are now estimating that with the new guidance that Brian gave, these first-generation products in the U.S. will now contribute approximately only $50 million to our 2015 revenues or 3% of the company total. Of course, many of our customers do appreciate the superiority of these lines, including those that have adopted SNAP Pro and its productivity and integration benefits. We believe we have correctly estimated the impact of the new competition, as the assumptions in the competitor trends for the full year 2015 are somewhat greater than the competitive impact we saw in Q1, even as we continue to refine our strategies with our new direct model.","The rest of our rapid assay business remains highly differentiated and showed in the first quarter the growth we expected in volumes, revenues or both. These lines are made up of our fourth-generation canine SNAP 4Dx Plus, certain unique specialty SNAPs, and of course, our businesses outside the U.S. Note that unlike the U.S., we face competitive offerings in our international markets that are similar to the competitive offerings being introduced in the U.S. this year.","While this adjustment to our growth as noted \u2013 with this adjustment \u2013 we've maintained our outlook of 12% to 13% organic growth for the year driven by broad based gains in the portfolio. This growth is supported by continuing set of important product launches, in addition to Catalyst One, coming out of our investments and innovation in R&D.","So let me review with you five significant new competitive offerings that are expected to come to the market in the next 12 months. First is SDMA. As I mentioned in our January call, our next generation chemistry marker, SDMA, is the most important test innovation we have brought to the veterinary profession in the history of IDEXX, as a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease earlier in the progression of this irreversible condition than traditional parameters. Early diagnosis allows for earlier treatment.","The launch of SDMA in our reference labs is now underway with the results already being provided to a couple hundred customers as part of our rollout process. The automatic inclusion into the chemistry panel for IDEXX reference lab customers in North America, well over 10,000, is now scheduled for the beginning of July. SDMA is proving to be of keen interest to veterinarians and its introduction is giving our expanded sales force of 175 U.S. veterinary diagnostic consultants, as well as those that we have in Canada, virtually unlimited access to veterinarians and decision makers.","Our market research shows that perhaps 20% to 25% of reference lab costumers will consider switching labs just to gain access to SDMA and the chemistry profiles. And those that don't can still send us samples for SDMA testing at a price of $19.95 per sample. SDMA will augment IDEXX's reference lab growth and indeed our overall growth of the CAG recurring diagnostic revenues through new customer acquisition, strong retention and greater utilization.","Second is fecal antigen. Next week, we will complete the launch of our expanded fecal antigen panels in our North American reference labs. Our new hookworm and roundworm antigen tests will be added to our already highly differentiated whipworm antigen offering. Our unique antigen panels catch the presence of adult worms earlier in the infection cycle than current egg detection methods, enabling faster diagnosis and treatment for pets. This innovation in fecal test will also continue to drive good growth in our reference lab mortality.","Third is the T4 slide on Catalyst Dx. At the end of June, we'll be launching our already highly popular T4 slide available on Catalyst One since February, to our large Catalyst Dx installed base in North America. T4 is an important test for canines and felines and is already included by customers in over 60% of the panels that are sent to the reference lab. The T4 slide can be run conveniently with the rest of the chemistry panel on the Catalyst platform, a unique capability in in-house chemistry.","Fourth is our advanced software-as-a-service practice management software. Later in Q3, we'll be launching a highly innovative SaaS-based practice information management offering in North America. We've launched a similar offering in Europe in Q4 and growth since launch has exceeded our already high expectations.","We will also be launching a SaaS-based digital imaging software in Q3. A SaaS-based IT ecosystem for our customers, which of course, many are already using with VetConnect PLUS, adds a profitable subscription-based revenue stream, but importantly, supports increasing diagnostic utilization, customer retention and acquisition.","Fifth, is a new analyzer, a urine sediment analyzer. In early 2016, we expect to launch a urine sediment point-of-care analyzer that is an extension to the IDEXX VetLabs suite of in-house analyzers. Virtually every practice performs urinalysis manually as part of the basic workup or the minimum \u2013 what we call the minimum database of chemistry hematology and urinalysis.","This instrument system introduces an entirely novel way to perform a urine sediment review with unparalleled accuracy, staff productivity and turnaround time. We estimate that we will generate between $150 million and $200 million in profitable cumulative revenue over five years after launch and that's (26:10) between instruments and consumable revenues. The availability of this novel analyzer reinforces the value of the IDEXX integrated diagnostic offering.","With SDMA, fecal antigen, T4 and Catalyst, new software-as-a-service offerings in 2015 and the new analyzer in early 2016, our innovation strategy remains in high gear.","Our commercial organization, both in the U.S. and internationally, is in place and growing in capability with each passing quarter. The combination of a highly differentiated diagnostics and information technology offering and a highly effective direct global commercial organization that is representing our solutions effectively to veterinary practices gives us confidence of strong organic growth for years to come in the highly attractive market for animal health.","With these comments, Brian and I are now willing to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the information. Let may ask another one on the rapid assays. I'm curious with the first-generation products there, are you seeing actual market share losses to the volume of those products or is it just increased price competition such that you're lowering your prices to match competitors and that's impacting the growth outlook?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's \u2013 obviously we're responding with selective pricing strategies \u2013 and it is also impacting the volume. So really what we saw in Q1 \u2013 and just a reminder \u2013 what we've calibrated for the year is a little bit greater than what we saw in Q1 is a combination of both of those.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And you mentioned there's about $50 million in first-gen products, I'm curious how much of that is currently sold, if you have the number, outside of what you would refer to as the larger IDEXX customer. So, again, those that just use those first-gen products and no other IDEXX which may be more susceptible, if you will, to share loss?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, obviously some of our customers, larger customers, have adopted SNAP Pro. We generally have a better position with larger customers. Obviously, we're calling on the larger customers more frequently and of course, larger customers buy more diagnostic. So certainly the majority is, with the large customers, but of course there's a long tail of small-cap customers that makes up the minority of that revenue.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, one quick follow-up on the salesforce and I'll hop off, just how many quarters have you seen it in the past take to ramp to what you would consider kind of a normal run rate performance when the reps start seeing new accounts? Is that a one to two quarter phenomenon or does it last longer?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think if you go back to when we reconfigured our salesforce in 2013 and the third quarter was really the first quarter that we had that fully in place. That was, what I would call \u2013 and you can go back and look through your notes too \u2013 a good but not great quarter. The fourth quarter was a very good quarter. And then the first quarter of 2014 was an even better quarter.","So, we're pleased with the base that we established with this new territory configuration and expanded sales reps in the first quarter of 2015, and we expect that every quarter, as their relationships with their calling patterns and the customers deepen, and of course our product offering continues to have new things to impress and talk about that \u2013 the productivity of that salesforce will increase like it did when we made that change in 2013.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess, I've got a follow-up on the rapid assay and then just sort of more of an overall P&L question. But to follow up on rapid assay, Jon I think you said, $50 million of the $65 million in the first generation sort of remains, that would imply that about 25% of the first generation is being lowered. But it seems like a really big number, especially when I believe the $65 million would be worldwide, so I guess what I'm trying to tease out, can you just talk to us about your confidence in call it your 4Dx or 4Dx plus business? What are you seeing there? Are you seeing any signs of churn in that particular business?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So first of all, the $50 million is just the U.S.; it doesn't include any international revenues, so just to clarify on that, on that one point. We saw good volume gains in 4Dx in the first quarter and so 4Dx remains highly differentiated. Obviously, it's got six tests. Its accuracy is unparalleled. Its convenience is unparalleled. Many of those customers are integrated with SNAP Pro. It's a little bit more concentrated customer set, a little bit more concentrated geographies. They're the ones that our reps call on. We'll be, of course, augmenting our capability there as we expand.","One element of our field sales strategy which is really being put in place in second quarter, is our professional service veterinarians, the 12 regionally-based professional service veterinarians. And we've hired almost all of them now; they generally come from other animal health companies. So they know exactly what the job is \u2013 they just need to learn our part of veterinary medicine. And they're very effective in communicating the importance of vector-borne disease testing. So we \u2013 of course, we have competition across all of our products \u2013 but we think we're better positioned with a highly differentiated product line and a little bit more concentrated customer set.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then I'll ask a second question. I'll try to make it into two parts. I guess the first one, you beat our estimate by a penny, but you fell pretty well far below in CAG, EBIT, the unallocated was meaningfully ahead. Brian, is that a function of some of the FX hedges that you mentioned? I guess I'm just trying to sort of tie out why the \u2013 the EBIT missed and CAG and came so far ahead in unallocated.","And then Jon, part B of that is to shift gears. At a high level, can you just share with us any other surprises? I mean, you're six to nine months into this transition, I'm guessing call it the first-gen rapid churn is a surprise on the negative side. Anything else you want to call out negative or positive at this point? Thanks, guys.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Look, I think our profit performance reflected better than expected operating expense performance in the quarter which was largely just driven by timing of costs. We saw some pressure there but relatively less than we anticipated and that helped us to deliver solid results in the quarter. The unallocated segment includes things like capitalized variance benefits on product cost that we, for simplicity, kind of capture that centrally. And so that's a true benefit to the company; it's just where we reflect in in terms of our segment reporting. It is a lower product cost benefit that helps us support better margins.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Jon, to answer your questions, I think the ones were on surprises in the quarter. I would call out two. First of all, our European organization really took the Catalyst One launch and delivered over 100% growth in Catalyst platform placements. Not all of them are Catalyst One's, but they have really demonstrated the potential of Catalyst One in our international markets and that's just an extraordinary performance. And of course, they had very strong growth in the hematology platform, too.","And we have a very good set of direct sales organizations in Europe. We have it internationally; we haven't launched it fully internationally yet but that was very impressive performance. And their momentum, I might say, our instrument placement momentum in the second quarter, both internationally and the U.S., the order rates continue to be extending from the momentum we had out of Q1. So that was very, very impressive.","The second thing is SDMA. We knew SDMA was going to be a really innovative test, but we have been surprised that what SDMA has done to allow us to gain access to veterinarians that would normally screen out sales reps. They want to hear about it. And the reason why they want to hear about SDMA is because every week, they suffer the pain of diagnosing too late a chronic kidney patient; and typically these only have months to live and there's not a lot they can do. There's short term things to do, but it's a very frustrating thing for a veterinarian to diagnose something too late.","And SDMA gives them a lot more time to have a lot more opportunity to slow the progression of this irreversible disease. And they want to hear about it and it is well researched with a number of patients \u2013 dozens of papers and abstracts including one that just got launched \u2013 published yesterday. So well documented, they want to hear about it. Our reps are fully able to talk to them about it.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. On sort of the retention rate in rapid assay platform, when a clinic switches over, how would you characterize those types of practices? Is it high-volume rapid users? Are they still using 4Dx? Are they experiencing lots of fluctuations on the equipment side of the business, the reference laboratory testing? If you could characterize that dynamic, that would be great.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. As we \u2013 as I mentioned \u2013 it's really a tale of two parts of the rapid assay business. We saw good volume gains in the first quarter for our highly differentiated products including SNAP 4Dx and some of our specialized rapid assay, but we saw volume declines and some prices we responded in the first generation. The first generation products like the feline combo product and heartworm, they were launched in the early 1990s, so they have been around a while.","So it's really a different behavior between the two \u2013 this is \u2013 the thing about rapid assay is you can \u2013 a customer can switch back and forth. Sometimes they try something and they realize it wasn't what they thought it was or wasn't what it was built to be or didn't have the accuracy. It's very painful to miss a positive, which is really important because we're diagnosing deadly infectious diseases here. And when they miss a positive \u2013 one positive that they miss because perhaps the platform they were using and the product they were using is not as accurate \u2013 can be very painful.","So, we saw that's when our competitor in the reference lab business launched \u2013 reference lab competitor of 4Dx \u2013 people tried it but they came back. And many of them came back, so we expect to see a little bit of that kind of churn. But we think we have \u2013 we think we have the outlook calibrated.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And in light of the noted competition, it seems like it's a little bit greater than what you initially thought. Do you see the need to step up investment or expand your salesforce over the next six to 12 months or is this something that you're going to reassess at a later date?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, I think what \u2013 our plans that were already in place are underway. And as I mentioned, we are adding the professional service veterinarians. We always planned to add that in the second quarter; that's on track. Most of those are already hired and on board. And so that's an expansion that's already underway. But I think it's more that we're gaining both relationships and experience in the new model \u2013 as we have demonstrated \u2013 happens when we made the first change in 2013.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, starting off with Brian. Could you give us some color on your free cash flow? Turned negative on the operating cash side and there's a big change in working capital, I'm just wondering, what's causing that and how should we think about that going forward?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","A lot of that is just driven by the transition of the go-direct model and stepping up the \u2013 our internal receivables levels and inventory. We had projected before $15 million to $20 million increase this year in working capital related to that change and I think that's basically all you're seeing there. And our full year outlook is largely the same. We are growing very quickly in the lab business and doing more self-manufacturing and we have increased some investment in those areas and that was what was noted in the free cash flow outlook.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great, that's helpful. And then, Jon, just going back to some of the new competitive offerings starting with SDMA. I think you guys said that's going to be included in all panels. And it's obviously great that it will help vets diagnose for earlier treatment options, but just wondering how you're thinking about the revenue generation expectations and how can you participate in some of these earlier treatment options to benefit IDEXX?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we are not \u2013 that's a great question. Okay. So we're not in the treatment business, we're in the diagnostic business, but I will tell you that those who are in the treatment business are very interested in promoting SDMA because it expands their treatment options. I mean, obviously, if you can catch it in one case, 19 months earlier or six to 12 months earlier and slow the progression through whatever treatments that there are out there, that's good for their business. So that's kind of a positive tailwind in our business.","From our perspective, it really drives our overall recurring revenues. Veterinarians appreciate highly that we are adding it at no incremental cost to the chemistry panel. What this will do, Kevin, is instantly change the standard of care in veterinary practice. And so, that's going to aid in customer retention, customer acquisition. It makes a stronger case to do preventative care testing, because if you can catch things earlier in a preventative care scenario that's \u2013 that pets live longer. And then also, we'll have a revenue stream from those who just want to send us their samples for SDMA only, as I mentioned into my comments.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And actually I just had one quick follow-up there. On the urine sediment analyzer, I think you said it was going to be $150 million to $200 million in revenue over five years. Is that all incremental or how should we think about cannibalization away from like some in-clinic and reference lab testing?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I greatly appreciate that question. First of all, it doesn't cannibalize anything internally because what it is replacing is manual microscopy, right. So this is a are brand-new category. This isn't an incremental, a better, faster, cheaper version of something that we already offer. This is a totally new category, so it's all incremental to in-house. We have found that testing begets testing. When it's easier to do a urine sediment, you're going to do more of them. Most \u2013 we think that there are roughly a little bit more than half of urine sediments are run in-house \u2013 some are sent out to the reference lab. This could make the case to run it more in-house, but we've seen really time and again, when you run more testing, it generates more reflex testing at the reference lab.","And this was the question that we got when we launched our very innovative \u2013 I remember we got this question a lot \u2013 when we launched LaserCyte over a decade ago. Is that going to take away from reference lab business? And you've seen, of course, the reference lab business grow and the market grow significantly over that period of time. So the nice thing is it's all \u2013 this is a whole new category of testing for us and reinforces really the value of having an integrated IDEXX suite of analyzers because they all work together with one patient. It's fully integrated into the software, and of course, instant results through VetConnect Plus.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You were able to accelerate competitive account wins to 59% from 54% on Catalyst. Is the 59% a global number and would you attribute the acceleration largely to Italy and other parts of Europe? And then maybe the second part, Jon, given the lower price point of Catalyst One, I'm curious what your degree of confidence is to accelerate competitive wins into the 60%'s?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that is a U.S. number or North American number. That is not \u2013 the 59% \u2013 is not a global number. So it's a little harder to track globally. Obviously, when you had 66% growth in Catalyst placements internationally, it's coming from a lot of places.","So obviously, international was a good number but I really wanted to focus on the North America. We believe there are over 10,000 accounts that have the opportunity for us to convert to a Catalyst One. Catalyst One is a very effective price point and it is \u2013 brings far more capability to the practice in terms of menu, in terms of time to resolve, in terms of ease of use, in terms of workflow, of course, integration with VetConnect PLUS. I mean, the list goes on. So \u2013 and at a very competitive price point \u2013 so we expect that number is, as I've mentioned, again North American number, we expect that number to stay strong and perhaps grow over time as our salesforce gains in their capacity and their relationships with all the customers in their territory.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I'd just add, we get a lot of questions as you know, on the chemistry dynamics in the U.S., our Catalyst space expanded in the quarter and our consumable revenues continued to grow well ahead of market growth rates. So we're expanding our presence.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's \u2013 and acquisitions net of Perfection (45:27). So, and of course, the consumable growth is what it's all about and that's growing, as Brian mentioned, higher than \u2013 at very attractively and higher at-market rate.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then maybe my follow-up question, with the Catalyst One launching in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, I think you said it might roll into Q3. I'm curious if there's any modest delay there and maybe can you help us frame what your expectations are in some of these, what I might call, emerging markets?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, no, there's no delay. This is \u2013 this was \u2013 it is totally \u2013 these smaller country operations are \u2013 they have \u2013 we have limited \u2013 we have, of course, direct capability, but they're limited, they've got a lot going on. So the Q2 and Q3 are really very consistent with our plans. No delay in launching, as I mentioned, the instrument is performing really fabulously and that of course makes it easier to launch in these smaller country operations.","I might mention, for example, when we say Asia-Pacific, we're talking about Australia. I wouldn't call that an emerging market. That's a very attractive market for us; but of course we've got the Asian countries. The only market we're not going to be able to launch it in this year is Japan, because that has regulatory approval associated with it.","We're also very excited about our presence in Latin America, but for Venezuela, which is basically gone off the map. We've got a great organization in Brazil and Mexico and some of the other South American countries. As you know, we acquired our distributor in Brazil and they've really gotten off to a great start. And so \u2013 this analyzer is just very, very well suited to the kinds of practices that are \u2013 smaller practices, these are typically international but also in the U.S. that didn't buy the Catalyst DX, it was too much analyzer for them, maybe a little bit higher price point. Catalyst One brings all capability of DX at a lower price point.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. A lot of topics have been addressed, but just two ones for me. Regarding the hedging gains, Brian, that you've talked about, I think, several times in the release, I think it was $0.33 to earnings and that's offsetting some of the FX headwind. How should we be thinking about that for 2016 in terms of the modeling? Is that a baseline of take our 2015 number, $0.33 lower and grow, or just maybe help us sort of better understand the economics or math behind the hedging gains for 2016? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Sure. Yeah, no, we obviously haven't given any indications for 2016 at this point, but I do think it's important to note that we will not have the benefit of those gains next year. So that will be something that we'll need to lap and will be a headwind for us heading into next year, which is why we're trying to disclose it and be clear on that. As you know, hedges are effectively something that delay impacts; they don't eliminate things so the prior hedges we put in place kind of protect our profit this year, but as those roll off the net impact of the substantial strengthening of the dollar will be reflected in our operations.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then on the \u2013 going back to the rapid assay, not trying to beat a dead horse here \u2013 but thinking about the timing of some of the competitive announcements. Baxter's, I think, had some inter-quarter new placement \u2013 or new approvals \u2013 and considering, I think, Jon, you mentioned that you're expecting more of a headwind in the back half of the year relative to what you witnessed in 1Q regarding this first-generation devices. Is that the reason from a \u2013 because you're a little bit worried about competition or is there something I'm missing there? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Again, my comments were focused on the first-generation of products. And I think it's just a calibration as we look at all the factors involved. The competitive products are out there. They were out there in the first quarter. That affect these first-generation of products. So I think it's just basic \u2013 we wanted to make sure that we calibrated it correctly \u2013 as best we could using our judgment.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl & Company. Your line is open.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, on the urine analyzer, you project a launch early in 2016. On the $150 million over five years, do you mean cumulative revenue over five years or looking at $150 million annually in kind of 2020 or 2021?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No, that was a cumulative \u2013 it was to just kind of give you a ballpark understanding \u2013 but it was a cumulative over the first five years. Obviously, we're going to sell it beyond the five years; it has a consumable stream. We think that virtually every practice is a candidate to buy this analyzer because virtually every practice does a manual urine sediment review as part of the work-up. But it's a cumulative number.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.","Okay, thank you. And then on the rapid assays \u2013 excuse me \u2013 have you changed or do you expect to change the 4Dx pricing as a result of the pressure on the first-generation single test products?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No, I think, we're always fine tuning our pricing strategy. One of the things we have is a program called SNAP Up the Savings; that's worked for us historically. We are always fine tuning that. But I think the trends that we saw in Q1 with \u2013 where we had good volume \u2013 very, very good volume means that really \u2013 not in the 4Dx, not a lot of pricing gains. It was real \u2013 good volume would be the expectation that we have, generally speaking, for the balance of the year.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.","Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you, gentlemen.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. It's actually funny, I thought I took myself out of the queue but while I've got you I might as well ask it. Just at a high level, Jon, I mean, again going back to the rapids, the $65 million to $50 million, can you just talk about where we go from here? In other words, I'm just trying to figure out, do you believe that continues to bleed lower? And I guess what I'm trying to ask another way is, when we get beyond 2015 where things just went pretty south pretty quickly in that direction if you sort of strip out the margin capture, you're looking down according to our numbers, I think, down 3% to 4%. Can you restage growth in rapids in 2016? Thanks, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We haven't really given a guidance for 2016, but what I will mention is, we do have superior products and this is the first quarter within our new sales model. And so, we're really ramping up our relationships and in case of infectious disease, which of course the majority of rapid assays are infectious disease, our professional service veterinarians are important. And our marketing strategies to this broad base of customers, both not just field, but of course, phone-based (52:49) and other marketing strategies.","So, we think we've correctly calibrated the reset here for the introduction of new competition. Obviously, what's really driving growth in IDEXX is the continued innovation across the diagnostic portfolio and we think that's \u2013 again these products, in many cases, were launched over 20 years ago \u2013 but we think it's really the innovations that are going to be driving our growth going forward.","And we do \u2013 we're refining our strategies to keep the entire customer relationship in all the product lines and certainly when we're calling on customers \u2013 when we call on customers we do a very good job of talking about the level of differentiation. It's just that we can't always get to all customers with our direct field organization early on with the new competitive entrants.","Operator","And with that, you can go ahead with any closing remarks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I want to thank everybody for being on the call. And I really also would take this time to congratulate the IDEXX organization. This was a major transformation that we undertook in 2015 with our U.S. direct strategy. Our international operations just had an extraordinary performance. I think it sets us up well for the year globally.","And certainly our product and innovation teams, as I've mentioned, our innovation is in high gear with a variety of product launches that start from next week and extend over the course of the year \u2013 balanced toward the first part of this upcoming 12 months \u2013 and then the urinalysis analyzer \u2013 a whole new analyzer.","So, we've got the field organizations to sell the product and our innovation is on track. So with those closing comments, I'll conclude the call and thank you, everybody.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Garber, Director, Investor Relations.","IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our earnings release, which can be found on our website, IDEXX.com.","In reviewing our third quarter 2015 results, please note all references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2014, unless otherwise noted. Also when we refer to normalized organic growth, in addition to adjusting for exchange and acquisitions, we have adjusted for changes in distributor inventory levels.","In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us in our call. Today, I'll take you through our Q3 results and outlook for the full year, and I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2016. Jon will follow with his comments.","In terms of highlights, we delivered 12% normalized organic revenue growth in the third quarter, supported by very strong instrument placements and continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our profit results were solid in Q3, adjusted EPS was $0.54 per share, up 9% on a comparable constant currency basis.","Please note that our adjusted EPS results exclude impacts from a capitalized software impairment charge. As part of our evolved information management strategy, we decided to refine our approach to developing our Practice Intelligence business, and our IDEXX Neo cloud-based information management software offering. Reprioritization of efforts in this area resulted in a non-cash charge of $8 million or about $0.06 per share in Q3. We'll talk more about the evolution of our information management approach, which is supporting strong revenue gains, later in the call.","As we look forward, we're updating our full year 2015 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance today to reflect our growth current trends as well as some select impacts from foreign exchange changes and updated effective tax rate estimates. From an operating perspective, while our growth remains strong, we're tracking towards the lower-end of our earlier revenue guidance range for 2015, which had targeted a greater acceleration of growth in the second half. This outlook has been impacted recently by moderated market growth in Europe and effects from more challenging macroeconomic trends, including currency changes, constrained targeted emerging market gains.","Consisting with this revenue outlook, we're refining our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2015 to $2.04 to $2.07 per share, including approximately $0.03 per share of headwind combined related to recent foreign currency rate changes in emerging markets as well as a 50-basis point higher estimate for our 2015 effective tax rate, reflecting updated regional profit mix projections also impacted by currency effects. Our 2015 reported EPS outlook will also incorporate the $0.06 per share impact from the software impairment charge.","As noted, we'll be reviewing our preliminary guidance for 2016 today, which reflects targeted revenue of $1.715 billion to $1.735 billion and EPS of $2.09 to $2.16 per share. This outlook reflects expectations for continued solid operating performance, including normalized organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and constant dollar operating margin improvement of 50 basis points, supporting 13% to 16% constant currency adjusted EPS growth.","As noted in earlier reviews, meaningful FX headwinds will constrain reported financial gains in 2016. 2016 foreign exchange impacts include the lapping of $20 million in 2015 hedge gains, year-on-year effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar on revenue and profit growth and an additional 50-basis point increase in our effective tax rate driven by unfavorable profit mix impacts related to currency changes. Combined, these currency-related effects will lower reported operating margins and reduce 2016 EPS by about $0.21 per share. We'll discuss these impacts more detail as we review our 2016 preliminary guidance.","Let's begin with the review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Organic growth in Q3 continued to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $344 million, reflecting 14% normalized organic growth. Our Water business also continued its solid revenue gains, increasing 7% organically to $26 million, reflecting solid existing and new business growth across major regions.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue was $30 million, up 6%, supported by gains in bovine, poultry and swine testing in Europe and emerging markets, including benefits from our new dairy pregnancy testing products.","Overall, U.S. revenues were $252 million in the quarter, up 13% organically. U.S. gains were supported by very strong instrument revenues and 12% normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, reflecting continued strong growth in reference lab and instrument consumable sales as well as improved growth in rapid assay.","IDEXX's performance continues to outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth as reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q3, this market level data showed patient visits increased 2% and clinic revenues increased 5.2%, each down about 1.5 points from strong H1 market growth trends.","International revenues in the third quarter were $154 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong CAG growth, including the benefits of recent acquisitions. International CAG normalized organic growth was 14%, supported by very strong instrument placements and 9% normalized organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Recurring CAG growth in Europe moderated in Q3, reflecting relatively softer patient traffic trends, impacted by the economy and unusually hot weather trends this summer.","As noted, global instrument revenues were outstanding again this quarter, driving 54% organic growth in instrument revenues to $26 million. When the approximately $3 million benefit from recognition of differed revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers is excluded, instrument revenues had Q3 organic growth of 37%. Strong premium instrument placement trends, including sustained high placement levels at competitive accounts in the U.S., are supporting continued growth of our instrument base globally.","Of note, our U.S. premium instrument base continued to expand solidly this quarter, supporting 18% growth in our Catalyst installed base, net of estimated customer defections, in the U.S. over the last year. Jon will review our strong momentum in expanding our instrument base in more detail in his comments.","Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued solid gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q3, global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $290 million, up 11% organically. Instrument consumable revenues of $99 million grew 16% normalized in Q3 supported by a strong global volume gains and net benefits from U.S. margin capture.","Consumable growth moderated somewhat from Q2, impacted by relatively lower growth in Europe compared to very strong Q2 levels. We also saw relatively moderated consumable growth in Q3, reflecting carryover impacts from heightened competitor placement activity in our U.S. customer base in Q4 of 2014 and the first half of 2015, which partially offset benefits from strong new customer placement gains and consistently solid same-store growth trends.","While these effects from earlier competitor instrument placements will carryover and constrain consumable growth somewhat in Q4, our progress in driving continued strong competitive chemistry placements, while improving retention rates at existing Catalyst accounts, will allow us to continue to expand our installed base and position us for improved reported consumable growth dynamics through 2016.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality, with revenues of $130 million, grew organically 10% in the second quarter (sic) [third quarter] (10:22), supported by 13% growth in the U.S., which offset moderated lab growth in Europe impacted by unfavorable weather trends, which constrained patient visits. We're targeting continued strong growth in lab revenues going forward, benefiting from a recently introduced SDMA test and fecal antigen panels.","Rapid assay revenues increased 7% normalized in Q3 to $48 million, reflecting volume gains in SNAP 4Dx kits in the U.S., stabilized trends in first-generation products and benefits from U.S. margin capture. Jon will talk more about dynamics in this area in his comments.","Combined information management and digital imaging system revenues increased 13% on a constant currency basis, supported by 9% organic gains and benefits from recent acquisitions. Our digital business posted modest reported gains despite solid growth in new placements, reflecting increased deferred revenues associated with bundled business commitments.","We achieved 19% constant currency growth in information system revenues, reflecting benefits from our recent cloud-based PIMS acquisitions as well as strong organic growth supported by increased services being adopted by Cornerstone customers, including the expansion of Pet Health Network Pro, as well as new business gains in our Practice Intelligence business. Looking to build on this strong momentum, we refined elements of our information management strategy to support our enhanced cloud-based offerings and to streamline our approach in expanding our Practice Intelligence business.","We're prioritizing investments in our strategy with the greatest return and have decided to discontinue certain development efforts for future commercialization, which were capitalized but not yet amortized in our P&L. This resulted in an $8 million pre-tax write-down of capitalized software assets. The prioritization we've advanced in our strategy will position us for accelerated revenue and profit in our information management business.","In terms of P&L performance, we delivered solid results in the quarter despite continued FX headwinds, reflecting benefits from strong organic revenue growth and operating expense controls. Operating profit was $80 million, excluding the asset impairment. On a comparable basis, excluding this charge, currency changes and prior-year transition impacts associated with the implementation of the U.S. all-direct strategy, operating profits increased 10%.","Operating margins were 19.7%, excluding the impairment charge, better than expected, reflecting benefits from cost management in the quarter. By segment, reported operating profit gains were driven by our CAG and Water businesses. Our Unallocated segment benefited from lower than budgeted spending in our corporate functions consistent with our cost management focus, as well as benefits from previously capitalized favorable variances, which reflected lower production costs.","Gross profit was $224 million in Q3, up 5% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins were down modestly, primarily reflecting business mix impacts from very strong instrument sales, which offset benefits from lower product costs. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $5 million or $0.04 per share in Q3.","Operating expenses increased 6% in Q3, excluding the software impairment charge, reflecting increases in global commercial capability, including resources added in support of the U.S. all-direct sales model. Reported operating expense growth was moderated by impacts from foreign exchange.","As noted, adjusted EPS, which excludes 2016 impairment charges of $0.06 per share, was $0.54 per share, up 2% from prior-year adjusted EPS or 9% adjusting for currency impacts. Prior-year adjusted EPS reflected adjustments for all-direct non-recurring transition costs of $0.03 per share and $0.02 per share non-recurring income tax benefit.","Adjusted EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year, which reduced average share count year-on-year by about 8%. In Q3, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $86 million. We ended the quarter with $1.14 billion in debt outstanding. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA, adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change and the impairment charge, were 2.92 times gross and 2.03 times net of $350 million in cash and investment balances at quarter-end; in line with our long-term target range.","Looking ahead, we're refining our full year 2015 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook as noted to reflect revenue trends at the lower-end of our targeted guidance range as well as to corporate updated estimates for currency impacts in our 2015 effective tax rate.","Our revised 2015 revenue guidance range is $1.595 billion to $1.605 billion; reflecting an outlook for approximately 11% normalized organic revenue growth. We expect continued solid organic revenue growth in Q4, supported by benefits from recent new test introductions, including our recently launched SDMA and fecal antigen tests in reference labs.","At the exchange rates noted in our press release, we estimate the effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce 2015 revenue growth by approximately 6% and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.16 per share. The projected negative impact from FX changes in 2015 is relatively higher than our previous outlook, reflecting recent erosion in emerging market currencies relative to the dollar.","Our 2015 profit outlook benefits from approximately $20 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains from previously established contracts, which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to approximately $0.15 per share after-tax EPS benefit.","Our refined 2015 adjusted EPS outlook is $2.04 to $2.07, including a combined $0.03 per share impact from additional FX headwinds since the Q2 call and a higher estimated tax rate of approximately 30.5% for 2015.","On a constant currency basis, the 2015 adjusted EPS outlook equates to 11% to 12% growth above 2014 adjusted EPS levels, which included approximately $0.03 per share benefit from the 2014 extension of the R&D tax credit. Reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.01, including the $8 million software impairment charge recorded in Q3.","Aside from our updated effective tax rate estimate, other elements of our full year profit outlook for 2015 are basically consistent with our prior guidance. Please note that our 2015 tax rate and EPS outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit, which has been renewed every year since 1997. Assuming renewal, we would expect an incremental EPS benefit of approximately $0.04 per share this year.","We're maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 80% to 90% of net income, incorporating higher working capital levels associated with the U.S. all-direct transition and expectations for capital spending levels of approximately $100 million this year.","As we finished 2015, we have solid growth momentum and a strong innovation pipeline that position us well to deliver continued strong operating performance as we move forward. Today, we're providing preliminary financial guidance for 2016. Our preliminary outlook is for revenue of $1.715 billion to $1.735 billion, reflecting targeted normalized organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%.","Consistent with our strategic plan outlook, we're targeting 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis in 2016, driven primarily by operating expense leverage. Please note that this outlook adjusts 2015 for the impairment charge. Strong cash flow generation will support continued capital allocation toward share repurchases, resulting in an estimated reduction of approximately 3.5% in our shares outstanding in 2016.","We expect to maintain gross leverage levels of approximately 3 times EBITDA gross, and expect annual interest expense in the range of $31.5 million to $32.5 million in 2016. These drivers are reflected in our 2016 EPS outlook of $2.09 to $2.16 per share, which equates to 13% to 16% growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis.","Foreign exchange impacts related to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar will be a key variable impacting our financial outlook in 2016, given that 25% of IDEXX revenues are related to products manufactured in the U.S. for export. At the exchange rates outlined in the press release, foreign exchange rate changes will reduce reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 1% and EPS by approximately $0.04 per share.","As noted, the expiration of previously established hedging contracts, which benefited 2015 results through the recognition of hedge gains that mitigated near-term profit impacts will have the effect of increasing reported cost of goods sold in 2016 by approximately $20 million or about $0.15 per share.","These FX impacts combined create approximately 150 basis points of operating margin pressure, which will offset our targeted 50 basis points in targeted constant currency operating margin improvement in 2016, resulting in a reported reduction in operating margins of approximately 100 basis points next year. Please note that these comparisons exclude margin impacts related to the impairment charge recorded in Q3.","FX changes will also contribute to an increase in our effective tax rate to approximately 31%, net of benefits from ongoing tax planning initiatives, reflecting relatively lower profit mix in international regions with lower effective tax rates. Combined, we estimate that FX impacts will create approximately $0.21 of EPS headwind in 2016, reducing benefits from our targeted 13% to 16% constant currency growth in adjusted EPS next year.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Brian, a little color commentary. We're pleased with the 12% normalized organic growth reported in Q3. The commercial teams around the world just did a stellar job with instrument placements. Total premium instrument placements globally were up 54% compared to Q3 2014, driven by 98% growth in Catalyst platform placements.","In total, we placed 2,424 chemistry and hematology instruments, comprised of 1,325 Catalyst chemistry analyzers, 234 VetTest Chemistry units and 865 premium hematology placements. The premium hematology placement growth of 15% was driven entirely by the higher-end ProCyte analyzer, up 36% year-over-year. This past quarter was the highest premium instrument placement quarter for IDEXX globally on record, notably exceeding any prior fourth quarter, typically the strongest of the year.","North America had an exceptional placement quarter of 1,026 chemistry and hematology units, accelerating 28% year-over-year and up 11% over Q2, which itself was up 15% over Q1. Of the 569 Catalyst placements in North America, 268 were to new or competitive accounts, up 16% year-over-year. Placement numbers were supported by customers augmenting their in-house lab capacity with a second Catalyst, as well as our continuing upgrades of our VetTest customers.","International placements of Catalyst and hematology analyzers continue to set record numbers supported by highly successful launches in several Asian markets. International Catalyst placements at 756 instruments were up an amazing 169% over Q3 last year. Globally, competitive and new customer Catalyst placements were up 53% year-over-year versus Q3 2014. Obviously, it was an exceptional quarter for Catalyst One around the world.","Our rapid assay performance was also very solid in Q3 with normalized revenue growth of 7%, including 6% in the U.S. We saw good growth in our all important U.S. canine vector-borne disease category in Q3 during the fall tick season, as U.S. SNAP 4DX kit volume growth, that's for in-clinic use, was 6% above last year's third quarter, bringing the volume growth to SNAP 4Dx kits positive year-to-date. Obviously, the revenues were much higher because of the price realization.","Our 4Dx offering in the reference lab has also been growing, actually much faster, but on a smaller base. Our first-generation SNAP volume decline stabilized in Q2 and held steady in Q3 and continued to meet our expectation. We are now winning back as many feline SNAP customers as we are losing, a tribute to our superior accuracy in detecting infectious diseases and our U.S. commercial organization's ability to spread this important message and compete aggressively in the 2015 environment. We also continue to benefit from higher retention of rapid assay customers with SNAP Pro and SNAPshot Dx instruments. These customers contribute 61% of our U.S. rapid assay revenue base.","Our U.S. lab business also continues to expand at a strong 13%, even though up against the tougher compare in Q3 of 2014, supported by our launch of SDMA. We now have three months of experience with the vertical adoption curve of SDMA in North America. In U.S. alone, we've provided results on about 1 million patient samples from over 12,000 accounts. This includes 1,600 accounts in the month of September that do not use IDEXX as their primary reference lab.","With North American labs online with SDMA, we are proceeding with the rollout in our international labs, having begun to offer the test with full rollout of the automatic inclusion of SDMA in all chemistry panels to incur in early-2016 in most non-North American labs.","As Brian mentioned, we achieved 19% constant currency growth in information management revenues. The revenue profile has now grown to 64% recurring revenues, up from 56% a year ago. These recurring revenues, which have high gross margin drop through, include software-as-a-service subscriptions, software maintenance fees and other recurring service and product revenues sold into the information management customer base. Profitability in the information management business is improving over time as a result.","We continue to advance our Cornerstone practice information management software offering, which has a growing installed base of roughly 6,000 practices. A new version of Cornerstone fully launched in September and under development for more than a year provides further advances in usability, functionality and integration with IDEXX diagnostic solutions.","Our portfolio of cloud-based software offerings continues to expand with the launch in September of Neo for the U.S. Neo is a highly innovative practice management system that follows a SaaS or software-as-a-service business model. We've been advancing Neo for a year, built off a cloud-based offering we acquired in Q4 of 2014. Neo has acclaimed ease-of-use and core functionality, all in an attractive monthly subscription price and little to no upfront cost to the customer.","As a result, Neo becomes a highly effective cost-effective option for new and smaller practices looking to move to current cloud technology software and not needing the more advanced workflow functionality of Cornerstone. As to cloud-based technology, note that we have a clear lead in experience and scale as we have over 3,000 paying customer subscriptions of one of our five software-as-a-service offerings, a number that has more than doubled over the past year. And we continue to expect robust growth in customer subscriptions supported by the U.S. expansion of Neo and growing customer base for all of our cloud-based offerings.","As to the product pipeline, we continue to track on the launch \u2013 with the launch of SediVue, our novel urine sediment analyzer in early-2016. This instrument and single-use consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the in-house process of examining urine under a microscope.","We expect an average unit price for the instrument in North America of around the high-teens in thousands of dollars and to place over a thousand analyzers in this market in 2016, although some placements will come through deferred revenue deals. Each instrument is expected to generate a new stream of consumable revenues averaging $3,000 to $6,000 (28:18) per year for IDEXX.","We also expect the novel SediVue instrument to attract customers with competitive in-house lab equipment to IDEXX's integrated in-house lab, including Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer. Our fecal SNAP product development continues to track nicely on schedule for a second half 2017 product launch.","So, really, in summary, we have solid business trends, and we're now in the position to fully leverage our significantly enhanced U.S. and international direct sales capability and strong innovation pipeline to deliver continued strong performance, including the solid 8% to 9% normalized organic revenue growth in 2016 that Brian laid out.","With this, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Let me start with one on the 2016 growth outlook as it relates to your organic revenue growth. I guess I'm curious, number one: it looks like your competitive position is clearly improving, but maybe macro headwinds are increasing a bit more and offsetting some of that, so, anyway that you can talk about growth expectations in the U.S. and O-U.S. as we look at 2016?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say, Ryan, thank you for the question. Our outlook is probably similar to where we are right now. We saw a 2% clinic patient visit growth in the U.S. We saw moderating patient clinic growth in Europe in Q3, some of that was weather, some of that was economy. So, that's kind of nothing special, but steady as you go macro market trends.","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","I think, Ryan, a couple of factors heading into next year to keep in mind. I think we'll \u2013 the trends that we're seeing in areas like rapid assay and (30:39), we feel great about. We will still be working through some anniversarying of effects of earlier inroads that will carry a bit into next year.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the U.S.","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","In the U.S., and I think that combined with some of the moderated trends that we've seen in places \u2013 international, some of that's currency driven, oil-based economy driven, I think combined lead us to have an outlook that's more consistent with our current growth rate, knowing that we will be kind of working through that. But I think our underlying operational foundation, we feel very good about the trajectory and the progress that we're making and, particularly, some of the innovation that we'll be bringing to market next year. So, we'll be looking to build on those growth rates.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up would be, I guess, Brian, to your comment right there and you mentioned it in the prepared comments. I think you said your premium placements on a net basis are up 18%, but you're also indicating that the competitive displacements earlier are hitting you. So, can you go into a little bit more on that dynamic? Is it just a timing issue where the gains have been more recent? So, you've got to lap through that. I guess, still with the 18% improvement in the net base, it seems like a pretty strong growth outlook.","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah, just to clarify that. That is the estimated installed base for Catalyst in the U.S. net of changes. And so, we've actually \u2013 I know there has been a lot of questions around this, but we have year-over-year expanded the Catalyst base by 18% and, in fact, quarter-to-quarter we had a solid growth rate consistent with that trend. So, that's been an upward trajectory.","I think the net effect, and Jon can enhance on this, is if you think about the growth rate in the business, things like consumables, we still have great new placements and we're growing the base and we have good same-store sales, but, obviously, there were earlier impacts for some competitor inroads that are slowing. And the net impact of that is in an annuity business that kind of plays in and kind of constrains your growth rate for a period of time, until you kind of work through the anniversarying effect.","So net-net, we're expanding, we're growing at very good rates. Some of those impacts constrained our growth. We'll work through that and anniversary that, and we'll be positioned for improving growth as we move forward.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, as you know, the consumable growth in any quarter is the cumulative impact of your acquisitions, net of any customer losses for the prior four quarters. And we've had obviously very strong and, in fact, improving customer acquisitions as we laid out in the U.S. in this call. And we believe we've seen a moderating rate of defections, but that's on a kind of quarterly sequential basis.","I think what's really happened here from IDEXX's perspective is that our new U.S. commercial organization, when you \u2013 which is about 300 professionals when you include the different types of field-based reps that are responsible for supporting the customer with diagnostics. That has really been seed \u2013 in seed now, in territory, they've gained those relationships, they've gained the experience. We expected that productivity of that group to improve over time. And I think you're seeing it with a growing number of instrument placements, really an extraordinary third quarter, and in improving customer retention levels as those relationships deepen in territory.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. And I want this question to be sort of polite, but maybe I just feel like I'm listening to little bit of a different call than when we were a couple of months ago. And I understand at the Analyst Day, there was a bigger emphasis on long-term and near-term. But still, you look at where we are today, you're bringing down numbers, you're bringing down numbers for maybe the second time in six or nine months.","So, can you just take a step back and maybe walk us through, Jon, how 2015 has progressed and maybe what has changed versus internal expectations, where we were a couple of quarters ago and then, even more specifically to August, what's changed over those past eight weeks where there was a lot of go, go, go, we're on offensive not defensive and that seems to have taken a step back as of this morning. Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. I think, operationally, operational performance is consistent with where we believe we were. I don't think there's really any change. I think what's happened in the last couple of months has been further deterioration of currencies, particularly in emerging markets and those are markets where we don't hedge. It's not practical to hedge. And there has been a little bit of a macroeconomic slowdown, as we mentioned, with visits in Europe.","But it's really the currency and the tax impact of the currency, which are the adjustments that we're talking about in 2015. And Jon, as you know, but I would remind everybody else, this call, the third quarter call in October of the year is when we typically provide guidance for 2016 for the first time. So, our guidance for the 2016 operation, I think, is entirely consistent with the long-term goals that we set. But I think now what we're providing to investors is an understanding of how currency and tax rate translates into the bottom line.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And maybe just to follow-up a little bit there, can you talk to the lab \u2013 I know the 10.5% organic was off of a difficult comp, but it is the weakest number that we've seen in seven quarters. That's on the heels of SDMA, which you laid out as the biggest launch in the company's history. And we've done a lot of work there, I get it, nothing changes overnight. But can you talk to, was it in line with your expectations and then tie that back to the 2016 revenue growth, it is 200 \u2013 the midpoint of 8.5% is 250 bps below the midpoint of your long-term guidance. I'm a little surprised by the magnitude of that delta, considering SDMA going into 2016. Thanks guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. Now, the lab growth in the U.S. market was a very solid 13% off of even a strong compare of 2014. So, that was a very solid number. And, of course, it's really U.S. and Canada we've launched SDMA in July. We haven't yet launched SDMA internationally and, really, the number \u2013 our global lab numbers was brought down by the labs outside the U.S. and the labs were affected by the slower patient traffic and the weather trends in Europe, which brings that number down.","But we continue to be \u2013 get absolutely positive feedback. I think the people who \u2013 the customers who are using SDMA are finding that it is extraordinarily valuable in the management \u2013 the diagnosis and management of their patients. And we have strong key opinion leader support globally for that. So, we continue to believe that's going to be a significant differentiator and driver for growth for us as we go forward. But, of course, we've got to launch it in the international markets and, I said, that won't happen until early-2016.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, I guess, just going back to SDMA, you cited in your prepared remarks, I think, 15,000 customers in September that don't use IDEXX, wondering if you actually...","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just 1,600.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","1,600, sorry. Thanks for the clarification. Are you seeing any of these guys switching over and are you seeing \u2013 you do believe you're gaining some market share in the reference lab market?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I believe the 13% organic growth in the third quarter is indicative of the cumulative success that we're having in the reference lab modality. I think that's higher than the market growth. And if your growth is higher than the market growth for lab modality, then by definition you're gaining share.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Well, can you break that 13% out between volume or \u2013 volume and price?","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","It's primarily volume.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Volume? Thanks, Brian. And then...","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As it has been, it's \u2013 a vast majority of it is volume and that's been consistent with the trends throughout the year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Sure. And then just going to your competitive placements for Catalyst, I think you said it was 268 new competitive account, just wondering how that's tracking relative to your internal expectations. And can you talk a little bit and give us color on the overall competitive environment? Are vet practices more willing to swap out to Catalyst One and, of your placements, I guess, how many were Cat One versus other instruments? And I guess, what's your general outlook and feel for the market at this point?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's always been and I think it will always be a very competitive market. I think our Catalyst One as demonstrated by a success around the world is a \u2013 it's a blockbuster product. It's a very cost-effective way to gain chemistry and it has really \u2013 it has capability that no competitive analyzer has in terms of menu, speed, and, of course, supported by information management integration uniquely two-way into the Practice Management software and VetConnect PLUS.","And so, really, what we're seeing, I think, is our sales organization is improving in their ability to tell that story to competitive accounts. And that's why we've seen a tick-up every quarter over the course of these three quarters of 2015 with the new sales organization placed in competitive placement and an extraordinary number of total placements in the North American market. In addition, I think that the retention rates that we're seeing in our Catalyst installed base are improving.","I also know, Kevin. that we really \u2013 that we entered Q4 with a very good backlog, larger than average, and an excellent order momentum early in the quarter, which are all generally \u2013 I think it's generally continuing to show signs that our sales organization and our innovation together will \u2013 is coming together nicely as per plan.","I will also mention that as we launch SediVue, the level of excitement in the customer base on SediVue is off the charts, because it really addresses a need that customers have. And we believe that SediVue will help us continue with \u2013 not only provide a nice revenue stream in and of itself, but can help us continue to inspire customers to upgrade to more advanced technology that we offer with the Catalyst One and the in-house lab. And that would, of course, happen in 2016 \u2013 early \u2013 starting in early-2016 with the launch of SediVue.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. First on organic growth guidance for 2016, the 8% to 9%, I just want to kind of get what you view normalized 2015 levels. I know there's a lot of puts and takes in 2015 with the margin recapture and the IDEXX deferral, IDEXX \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Catalyst One deferral adding about 50 bps.","So, if you look at your 11% normalized organic growth in 2015, is that a \u2013 when you adjust for all those moving parts, is the 8% to 9% for 2016 an acceleration, in line, a deceleration? Just want to get better views of how you're looking at the end market for next year. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah, that's a great question. We stopped \u2013 the margin capture effects got so integrated with our business, Nick, we stopped breaking that out. But, roughly, it's probably about a 3% benefit this year, a bit below. I think we originally had about 3.5%, and I think that reflects the rapid assay grew a little slower than this year than we originally planned.","So, I think, 3%, if you reduce the 11% that gets you to 8%. And then, if you're \u2013 we've got a 0.5-point benefit from the referral this year, so that would equate to roughly 7.5%. And so this would be an acceleration \u2013 a moderate acceleration, and I think that's reflective of some of the improving trends that we're seeing as well as the benefits from the innovation that we outlined at Analyst Day.","And I just want to reinforce that we are going to be working through some of the anniversarying of some earlier impacts. And I think as we get through that, we will see the benefit of that in terms of the improved retention and how that helps our overall growth rate. So, we remain confident on our ability to drive towards higher growth and feel like we'll be on that trajectory as we work through next year.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Very helpful, Brian. And then, secondly, on emerging markets, I know you guys have some exposure in Brazil, and I think you got some stuff in Asia-Pacific, but maybe just if you wanted to call out one or two or three markets where you're seeing maybe more volatility than what you had anticipated?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you've mentioned Brazil. Actually, our Brazilian team is doing a great job, but the real has just fallen out of bed and we don't hedge that. So, that's a case in point. We're also strong in certain Asian markets that had some currency, Russia is an example. And on the margin, these are just areas that are \u2013 that had some changes over the last three months that constrain our outlook for the year, although, we actually did pretty well in Q3 top line and bottom line considering.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. So, the first one is on the Catalyst placement to new accounts. I think the number in Q1 was 59% of Catalyst went to new accounts, I think in Q2 it was 61% \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Q1 59%, Q2 61%, and if I'm doing the simple math correctly, I think the number is 47% to new accounts for Catalyst in Q3.","At face value, if you could just confirm those numbers are right, it would suggest to me that something might have changed competitively in North America this quarter. And can you just kind of walk me through if my math is right and what might've changed?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you. I believe the 47% is right, but I will also note that the number of competitive placements in Q3 over Q2 grew 15%, the absolute number. And so, you ask, well, how can the absolute number grow and the percentage went down, well, that's because we did a great job placing Catalyst. In addition to the 15% growth in new and competitive accounts, we placed Catalyst with our \u2013 the remaining VetTest installed base, well, that's certainly getting smaller and smaller.","And we also had customers desire a second Catalyst; many of our larger customers who are growing their in-clinic volumes. And the nice thing about when we place a second Catalyst, we re-up that customer for a new five-year lease, which supports our retention. So, I think it's a good news story all the way around on an absolute basis, growth in competitive placements and on an absolute basis, an extraordinary growth in total placements. Meanwhile, the hematology platform continues to tick along with really good growth too.","As I said, it was an extraordinary instrument placement quarter. And those are just the U.S. numbers. The international numbers with that 168% growth in Catalyst placements is really quite a strong number in terms of placement growth.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And your competitor, last night, talked about two contracts in particular being up for contracts, one in the U.S., one outside the U.S., consisting of multiple hundreds of units of analyzers. I assume that those are your accounts today. Can you just comment perhaps on some of the moving parts that would go into a deal like this, and could you help us frame what type of impact we might see in out quarters?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're very close to our major accounts. We're not aware of any accounts being in jeopardy of where we have the accounts and where we have the business. So, I think that's what important from investors' point of view. We have solid relationships with the corporate accounts that are embedded in our installed base.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, last question for me. On the new products, clearly, some of my checks came back positive on the contribution from new products with veterinarians in 2015, but \u2013 and I appreciate some of the color you provided on SediVue. Is there any way you could help us frame maybe a dollar impact? Some of my initial thoughts were maybe up to $40 million for SDMA and $20 million for SediVue. But can you maybe help us think about how the dollar amounts might trickle in and what you've embedded internally in your guidance for 2016?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, a couple of things on the instrument side. Obviously, we're going to be anniversarying very, very strong placements with Catalyst in 2016. So, Catalyst growth won't be contributing to instrument revenue growth in the same way in 2016 as it has in particular this quarter. But on the other hand, we'll be selling a new instrument SediVue and just to give you a little color of that flavor, we expect to place, certainly, over a thousand analyzers in the North American market in 2016 and the average unit price we expect to be in the high-teens of thousands of dollars. And then, as those instruments are placed, each instrument over time \u2013 once they're placed, we expect to generate $3,000 to $5,000 a year in consumable revenue, so you can run the numbers on. That's North America.","Internationally, the launch will be a little later in the year and we'll update you in January when we got better feel for it. But, obviously, the material number is the North America launch. And as your research, I think, validated similar to ours the response to SediVue is really quite strong and every single customer is a greenfield customer for SediVue because we're replacing a manual method.","On SDMA, again, the SDMA is a differentiator, a strong differentiator for the reference lab over time. As you know, but to remind others, we don't charge incrementally for SDMA in and of itself unless they're just getting it as an individual assay. We have automatically included in the reference lab panel. So, what we expect SDMA to do will to contribute to stronger \u2013 even stronger retention in our reference lab business and new customer acquisition, as well as some modest growth in utilization, because many customers are now telling us they have much stronger case to run, preventative care chemistry on their senior paths, because kidney disease is highly prevalent.","In time one in three cats and one in 10 dogs succumb to the chronic kidney disease, and we've actually demonstrated that with our data of over a million data points now. If you look at it by age, it's tracking this very, very interesting data about how the prevalence of chronic kidney disease progresses with age. That's very compelling information. But any growth in utilization in the veterinary profession takes time. It's kind of a slow, but long-term growth factor for us.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have now further questions in queue. I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Ayers for closing remarks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining the call and I know we have a number of employees on the call too. I just want to congratulate everybody on the advancements in our business that the team has delivered, the extraordinary rate of innovation that we're bringing, plus what is also in the pipeline. And big kudos, I don't know who to congratulate more, our U.S. commercial organization or our international commercial teams. They both had really, really strong performance.","I think we're really seeing these teams seeded in territory now and really strengthening the relationship. And when you are direct \u2013 and we are direct in not only in North America, but in most developed international countries. There are things that you can do. You've got more control over your destiny and more opportunity to drive growth then when you don't have that advantage and we're really seeing that mature now in the performance in Q3 and we look forward to continuing have a dialog with investors about how that would translate into financials, which will translate into continuous growth in the shareholder value creation.","Operator","Thank you.","Jonathan W.

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits we will take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to, Brian McKeon.","Brian McKeon","Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. Today I will take you through our quarterly results and our updated outlook for the full year 2019. I will also provide an overview of our preliminary for 2020. Jay, will follow with his comments.","IDEXX delivered continued strong revenue and profit gains in Q3. In terms of highlights, revenues of $605 million grew 11% as reported and 12% organically, including over 1% of growth rate benefit from equivalent days.","CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14% organically, including nearly 2% of equivalent day growth rate benefit, reflecting double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets.","EPS of $1.24 per share increased 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from better than expected organic revenue growth, which supported 130-basis-point improvement in constant currency operating margins.","Excellent operating results are keeping us on track towards strong full year financial performance. In terms of our 2019 revenue outlook, we are refining our full year guidance to $2,395 billion to $2405 billion, a $5 million increase million increase at midpoint, incorporating our strong Q3 performance. This reflects an updated full year organic growth of 10% to 10.5% overall and 11.5% to 12%, for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, both at the higher end of our previous guidance range.","We are adjusting our 2019 EPS guidance to $4.72 to $4.78 or 15% to 16% growth on a comparable constant comparable constant currency basis. This is $0.12 per share lower than our prior guidance midpoint incorporating $0.18 per share in projected Q4 charges related to our recently announced CEO transition. Adjusting for this impact, our outlook is $0.06 per share higher at midpoint and corporate benefits from our strong third quarter operating performance and lower projections for full year net interest costs.","In terms of our preliminary 2020 outlook, we are projecting revenue of $2,610 billion to $2,650 billion, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%, supported by sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our 2020 EPS outlook is $5.30 per share to $5.46 per share or comparable constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 20%.","As we will discuss our 2020 EPS outlook incorporates $0.11 per share in projected headwinds, from year-over-year FX impacts and expectations for approximately $0.12 per share and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation activity.","Let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q3 revenue growth performance by segment. Excellent third quarter revenue growth results were driven by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including nearly 2% growth benefit from equivalent days in quarter.","By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including nearly 2% of growth rate benefit from equivalent days, reflecting continued strong gains in consumables and Reference Labs.","U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth remains primarily volume driven with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintained consistent exceptionally high levels of customer retention across modalities. IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends, which improved in the quarter.","In Q3, total visits per practice growth was 1.4% year-on-year with clinical visits per practice growing at 2.7% and overall revenue per practice increasing 5.3%, reflecting continued solid growth trends in the U.S. Companion Animal Healthcare market.","International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 16% organically in Q3, including approximately 1.5% of equivalent day growth benefit. International consumable revenue gains normalized for approximately 2.5% of benefits from equivalent days sustained at approximately 20% and international organic revenue Reference Lab growth improved to high single-digit rates.","Globally Reference Lab and consulting service revenues grew 12% organically in Q3, supported by consistent low to mid-teen volume-driven gains in the U.S. Robust U.S. lab growth continues to be driven by strong same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers, augmented by net customer acquisition benefits and moderate net price gains.","As Jay will discuss in October we closed on the acquisition of Marshfield Laboratories, a national service provider based in Wisconsin adding to our U.S. market capabilities.","Global consumable revenues increased 18% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth benefits. These results reflected strong growth across U.S. and international markets driven by increases in diagnostic test utilization and expansion of our installed instrument base.","We had an outstanding quarter in terms of high quality instrument placements, supporting double-digit year-on-year in our Economic Value Index or EVI. Overall, premium instrument placements increased 14% year-on-year, driven by 18% year-on-year growth in catalyst placements, which supported an 18% year-on-year increase in our global catalyst installed base.","Globally we placed 1,898 catalysts in the quarter with 360 yet new and competitive accounts in North America and 910 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also achieved 965 premium hematology placements globally up 18% and 589 SediVue placements, in line with strong prior year levels.","Please note that, we have expanded the data shared in our quarterly earnings snapshot available on our Investor Relations website, to include premium instrument placements by category and region, as well as quarterly tracking of our global premium installed base.","Rapid assay revenues grew 10% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth day growth benefits, reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx plus, specialty, SNAP feline [ph] and first generation products.","Growth in high customer retention in our rapid assay business continues to benefit from expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base, supported by an additional 2,683 SNAP Pro placements globally in Q3, bringing our global installed base to over 34,000.","Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 6% organically in Q3, driven by continued strong gains in VSS recurring service revenues. Overall, segment revenue gains were constrained in Q3 by comparisons to very strong prior year digital system placement levels.","In terms of our other business segment performance in the quarter, Water business revenues grew 7% organically, supported by continued solid growth across U.S. and international markets. Livestock poultry and Livestock poultry and dairy revenue, increased nearly 10% organically. Third quarter results were driven by strong year-on-year gains in Asia-Pacific markets, which benefited from a favorable prior year comparison.","The prolonged outbreak of African swine fever continues to negatively impact the swine population in China. However, demand for new diagnostic testing programs and increased diagnostic testing for alternative poultry food sources, offset lower recurring swine testing volume levels in Q3. Health herd screening levels while down from strong prior year levels were also relatively higher than expected in the quarter.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 increased 19%, as reported and on a constant currency basis, driven by solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased 130 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflected solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage on high revenue growth.","Gross profit increased 13% as reported, or 14% on a constant currency basis, in Q3. Gross margins increased 60 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by mix benefits from strong consumable revenue growth, lab productivity gains and moderate net price increases.","Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit were approximately $3 in Q3 and approximately $7 million year-to-date.","Operating expenses in Q3 increased 9% as reported, and 10% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 70 basis points of constant currency operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending and increased costs related to our expanded global CAG commercial capability.","EPS in Q3 was $1.24 per share, including benefits of including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share, related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.03 per share higher than projected. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 21%. Foreign exchange net of favorable year-on-year hedge impacts had an immaterial impact on operating profit and EPS in the quarter.","Year-to-date free cash flow through the third quarter was $195 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income for 2019. This reflects a consistent outlook for full year capital spending of $160 million to $175 million, including approximately $70 million of combined incremental spending related to our Westbrook main headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation.","Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $91 million in capital towards the repurchase of 330,000 shares in the quarter. We have maintained a strong balance sheet with leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA of 1.39 times gross and 1.24 times net of cash at the end of the quarter.","We continue to maintain a 2019 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at similar multiples of EBITDA. We now project annual net interest expense of $3.5 million, an improvement of $2.5 million compared to our previous guidance.","In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, as noted, we are refining our full year reported revenue guidance to $2,395 billion to $2,405 billion, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 10% to 10.5% and CAG recurring diagnostic organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12%, both at the higher end of our prior guidance range. At midpoint, this reflects a $5 million reported revenue increase factoring in our strong third quarter performance.","In this updated outlook, modest projected benefits from our recently completed U.S. lab acquisition are offset by refined projections for FX impacts. For the full-year, we now expect a 2% headwind from FX and revenue growth.","In terms of EPS, we are lowering our 2019 full year guidance by $0.12 per share at midpoint to $4.72 per share to $4.78 per share incorporating $0.18 of impact related to the CEO transition. These results in comparable constant currency growth of 15% to 16% for 2019 including approximately 4% of growth impacts related to projected Q4 transition charges.","Costs related to the separation agreement will lower full year 2019 operating profit by an estimated $13.4 million and year-on-year operating margin improvement by approximately 55 basis points. Incorporating this impact, our updated outlook is for 55 basis points to 70 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement or 110 basis points to 125 basis points of improvement excluding the Q4 transition charge impact, which is consistent with the higher end of our prior guidance range.","Our full year operating margin outlook includes expectations for higher levels of year-on-year operating expense growth in Q4, including effects from the advancement of an additional expansion of our U.S. commercial field resources, which Jay will discuss in his comments.","Strong full year operating margin performance excluding transition charge impacts and benefits from lower projected interest costs yield approximately $0.06 per share in full year operational EPS benefit compared to previous guidance.","Our updated EPS guidance assumes a 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20%, including approximately 1% of impact related to CEO transition costs. This tax rate also includes an updated estimate of $15 million or approximately 3% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation, netting approximately $0.02 of upside compared to previous guidance. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about 17% per share and full year share-based compensation tax benefit.","Operational share-based compensation tax benefit upsides are mitigated by $0.02 per share of negative impact related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our last conference call. Our 2019 EPS guidance now assumes $0.06 in negative full year impact related to FX charges net of hedge impacts and for the full year 2019, we are projecting hedge gains of $11.5 million.","As we look at 2020, we are targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2,610 billion to $2,650 billion, reflecting expectations for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue gains, supported by sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.","Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% with an estimated 0.5% foreign exchange headwind, related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, offset by year-on-year benefits from completed 2019 acquisitions.","Our preliminary 2020 EPS guidance of $5.30 per share to $5.46 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 100 basis points to 150 basis points on a constant currency basis, including approximately 50 basis points of year-on-year improvement, related to lapping the Q4 2019 charges related to the CEO transition.","At rates assumed in our press release, we estimate that FX will decrease reported operating margins by approximately 30 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.11 per share, net of established hedge positions, which we estimate will result in $6 of net pre-tax gains in 2020.","Our projected 2020 effective tax rate is 21% to 22%. This outlook assumes $3 million to $5 million or approximately $0.05 per share in share-based compensation tax benefits, assuming our current share price. Note that our projections for share-based compensation tax benefits share price, incorporates timing of future option expirations.","As IDEXX transitioned from seven year to 10-year option lives in 2013, this has the effect of lowering the level of options scheduled to expire in 2020, contributing to a $0.12 reduced projected tax benefit in 2020 compared to 2019. For 2020, we are projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases, at assumed consistent net leverage ratios and net interest expense next year of $36 million. ","Adjusting for changes in currency and share-based compensation tax benefits, this 2020 EPS outlook equates to a projected 17% to 20%, comparable constant currency growth rate. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2020 guidance in our year end conference call.","That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the discussion over to Jay.","Jay Mazelsky","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX\u2019s third quarter results reflected solid growth, across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water Diagnostic businesses, an outstanding achievement by our IDEXX team globally. High growth in CAG Diagnostic revenues continues to lead our performance, with attractive flow through benefits to profit, keeping us on us on track to deliver strong full year operating results. Excellent commercial execution is a key theme in our continued growth momentum and enhancing capability in this area consistently delivers a high return on investment.","In our U.S. CAG business we benefit from the increased IDEXX engagement with customers, in an underdeveloped diagnostics market, with solid growth momentum, as evidenced by the 2.7% growth in same-store clinical visits seen in the quarter.","Our U.S. commercial team remains highly productive, delivering 13% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth in the U.S., including approximately 2% benefit from equivalent business days. Execution was excellent across the Board, resulting in both impressive revenue gains from all modalities and sustained high customer retention rates.","Increased customer engagement is helping to drive sustained, low to mid-teens organic growth in Reference Labs, led by same-store testing expansion and double-digit organic gains and consumable revenues, supported by our expanding premium instrument installed base.","Instrument placements were excellent in the quarter, led by 14% year-on-year growth in U.S. new and competitive catalyst placements. This supported a 10% year-on-year expansion of our U.S. catalyst installed base and double-digit growth in U.S. EVI.","SNAP Pro placements were also robust in Q3 with over 2,200 placed in the U.S., up 77% year-over-year. SNAP Pro bring significant workflow electronic medical record and charge capture benefits that complement our differentiated rapid assay point-of-care diagnostics. Importantly, customers who are connected to SNAP Pro are highly engaged and stay with us longer.","Our U.S. commercial team continues to make excellent progress in advancing our preventive care initiative. In Q3, we enrolled 330 new practices, bringing our total enrollees since program launched to nearly 3,500, almost two-thirds of our VDCs had at least one new customer enrollee in the quarter.","As discussed at Investor Day, a key commercial goal is to inspire customers to increase the use of medically relevant blood work and clinical visits. When we consider blood work as a representative proxy for diagnostics utilization, it was included in only about 8% of clinical wellness visits in 2018.","The increased rate of diagnostics testing with blood work and practices post enrollment in our preventive care program is notable, specifically if we take our 2017 preventive care enrollees who have now been in the program for over a year, the average annual increase in a percentage of wellness is that include blood work is approximately 1% per year since 2016.","This compares to approximately 20 to 30 basis points of annual increase for non-enrollees. These convincing early success indicators reinforce the 1% to 2% contribution to annual CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth potential we see from this initiative.","Our strong growth in the U.S. demonstrates that diagnostics as a category continues to grow in importance and relevance to the veterinary profession. Our customers are in turn asking our category experts to spend more time partnering with them.","The combination of increasing customer engagement and key growth initiatives like IDEXX Preventive Care, strong operating results and commercial momentum and a healthy product pipeline gives us confidence to once again expand our commercial presence in the U.S.","We are already underway with an 8% expansion in our U.S. field based professionals, which we expect to be largely in place by the beginning of Q1 2020. As with our past field expansions, these are thoughtfully planned and supported by detailed regional analytical modeling that considers a number of factors including territory size and specific geographic differences such as traffic patterns and population growth.","The most important factor is the market opportunity, as calculated by our ability to grow our installed base, expand diagnostic testing and expand category share across in-clinic and Reference Lab modalities.","While we have said this before it bears repeating. The data continues to prove out that the more time we spend with customers, the more they grow with IDEXX. This expansion will bring us to an estimated 530 field-based professionals in the U.S., up from 490 at the end of 2018. We are very excited by the opportunity this expansion affords us heading into 2020.","The category of diagnostics is increasing in importance on a global basis as well. And as a result, we are seeing the benefits from our recently completed CAG commercial expansion in international markets.","We saw 16% international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth in Q3 including approximately 0.5 equivalent business days growth benefit. These gains were again led by international consumables growth of approximately 20% organically, normalized for equivalent business base and supported by continued expansion of our catalyst installed base, which increased 26% year-over-year.","Our international Reference Lab, showed improvement year-over-year, high single-digit growth, benefiting from the completed commercial expansion, strong commercial execution, as well as focus on customer service and IDEXX 360 programs that are increasingly multi-modal in character.","The IDEXX 360 program is gaining traction, with our international customers, supporting excellent instrument placements and double-digit growth in EVI, benefiting from a 28% year-on-year increase in placements, the new and competitive accounts internationally.","In addition to excellent commercial execution, the ongoing adoption and expansion of IDEXX differentiator\u2019s one of our industry-leading investments and innovation, is a second key theme, supporting our strong growth performance.","Our strong reference lab growth in markets like U.S. for example, continues to be supported by high-growth in parasitology, driven by growing adoption of our proprietary fecal antigen test. In the U.S. approximately 60% of parasitology panels run in our reference lab included, PCDX antigen in the third quarter, up from approximately 50% in Q3 2018.","Our performance leading 4Dx plus franchise also continues to expand. In the U.S. in addition to sustained solid growth in clinic, we are seeing high levels of incremental growth in 4Dx plus testing in our Reference Labs, following engagement with our preventive care programs.","As we have highlighted in the past, only approximately 36% of dogs in the U.S., received a vector-borne disease test to some kind, while only approximately 15% of dogs in the U.S. receive a full vector-borne multi-analyte test. This expansion of 4Dx plus usage is a very encouraging sign, with additional long-term benefits for vector-borne disease testing.","We also continue to make excellent progress advancing SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel, which our reference lab customers have benefited from since 2015 and launch to our catalyst installed base in early 2018. We now have over 70% of catalyst customers globally, who have purchased Catalyst SDMA, while almost 60% have used it. This has translated into a total of 2.9 million run since its introduction on a slide.","We are also very excited about the new SDMA based chronic kidney disease staging guidelines that were issued in September by the international renal interest society. This is an expert panel of internationally renowned nephrologist, who establish evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease.","The full incorporation of SDMA into CKD staging guidelines reflects the widespread recognition that SDMA is an accurate measure of kidney function. The impairment of which may be due to kidney disease or other disease processes.","These updated SDMA base staging guidelines, are the next step in improving not only early diagnosis of CKD, but also tailoring treatment to individual patients. IDEXX SDMA has transformed the landscape of how veterinarians manage patients with impaired kidney function.","Finally, we continue to extend our capability and advantages in veterinary software, by advancing our software on multiple fronts simultaneously. Our goal is to provide a truly comprehensive technology offering that both independent practices and corporate groups around the world rely on to run their businesses.","Q3 was again a strong quarter for global placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Adamana and Smart Flow Systems. Inclusion of software systems, on the IDEXX 360 program is accelerating commercial efforts in North America. In the U.S. practice management software placements grew 35% year-over-year.","Sticking with the U.S., we have seen it in a precedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades, the version 9.1 with more than 2,700 practices upgraded year-to-date across North America, driven by customer demand for the all new user interface and streamlined clinician experience.","We achieved yet another clinical development milestone for Cornerstone Cloud in Q3, which is now successfully running in a live environment for more a quarter. Initial customer feedback is extremely positive and we look forward to eventually making the many benefits of the cloud available to the thousands of customers that value Cornerstone as the standard bearer in practice management software.","Q3 was another strong quarter for growth for Webex with a 29% year-over-year increase in subscriptions. Our enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate groups continues to make big strides, providing a command and control center for corporate group C-suite and VetConnect plus the most widely used app in veterinary medicine had another strong quarter, growing out new functionality for sharing diagnostic results with pet parents and growing to more than 29,000 engaged practices globally.","In addition to our strides in growing our business organically, we are also pleased to highlight our recent acquisition of Marshfield Labs and the addition of their employees. Marshfield is a highly professional well-run laboratory that has a national customer base with a relatively stronger presence in the mid and upper Midwest regions. We look forward to quickly bringing our unique innovations like SDMA, Fecal Antigen and VetConnect PLUS to name just a few the Marshfield customers many of whom we work with today.","In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across a range of strategic fronts and believe we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in 2020 and deliver on our long-term financial goals.","Before I conclude and on behalf of all my IDEXX colleagues around the world, I\u2019d like to extend our thanks to John Ravis and our best wishes for John\u2019s continued rehabilitation. John\u2019s love and affection as a preparative translated into his deeply held beliefs on the unique role that pets in their care play in our lives.","As a result, he always reminded us of what\u2019s possible and what IDEXX could contribute through our unique diagnostics and software that expand the health and wellbeing of the pets we love. It\u2019s a John\u2019s vision that IDEXX as an organization will remain committed to helping strengthen the role and relevance of the veterinarian as the key to improvement the lives of pets and animals and the people who love them. On a personal note, I am looking forward to continuing to work with John both on the Board of Directors and as a trusted adviser.","And with that, we will open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","Hey, guys. How you are doing?","Jay Mazelsky","Good morning, Mike.","Brian McKeon","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Ryskin","First off congrats on the quarter really solid results in Q3, but I want to ask on the 2020 outlook briefly. First on the operating margin gains, you highlighted a couple of different moving pieces with the CEO charge in the fourth quarter. But you have also seen some really strong gains in gross margins this year. How should we think about the moving pieces in the progression extra you talked about 100 bps to 150 bps operating margin constant currency? How do we think about price on the gross margin line some of the cost controls in SG&A? You also have the sales force expansion that you talked about in the U.S. So a couple of different moving pieces. So how does that all shake out? And then a follow-on just on the broader outlook for next year, slightly more conservative view for the top line organic $9 million to $10.5 million, I realize still very early on. But anything really changing in the market just high level or is this just any particular area you could point to within Reference Labs or consumables or instruments or is this just initial guide, I want to take a cautious glance at the markets?","Brian McKeon","Yeah. Let me start with the operating margin clarification. You are right. The -- we have a compare here with the CEO transition charge that we tried to highlight. So our preliminary outlook of 100 basis points to 150 basis points, we noted included 50 basis points related to the comparison or favorability related to the charge, so if you adjust for that. It\u2019s 50 basis points to 100 basis points which is very consistent with our long-term goals and what we were indicating, what our goals were for 2020 back at Investor Day.","We are demonstrating that this is a leverageable business model that delivers a nice profit flow-through when we grow. At the rates we are targeting and have good progress with that as reflected in our Q3 results and our outlook for 2019.","I would highlight heading into next year we have a couple of factors that are built into the operating margin outlook. One is that, we have two significant new facilities that are coming online next year or new core lab in Germany, as well as our new Westbook headquarters. And we will -- that will involve a level of incremental costs and we will grow into that overtime. But initially that will be something that has the effect of moderating margin gains.","And as you pointed out, we have got the U.S. expansion, the additional expansion of U.S. commercial resources and we have a pretty healthy growth rate now in our year-on-year investment as we are fully ramped with our international expansion that we implemented a little earlier this year and we are investing in our R&D initiatives consistent with our stated goals. So we have got a healthy level of investment, some factors that will moderate kind of the upside on that. But we feel very comfortable with the underlying 50 basis points to 100 basis points of improvement outlook for next year.","On revenue the 9% to 10.5%, we noted, reflects a consistent outlook for sustaining continued strong CAG Dx recurring revenue growth which is really the main driver of our of our growth outlook. We are looking to build on the solid progress we have made on both the U.S. and international fronts on growing CAG Dx recurring revenues, which are right in line with our long-term goal ranges.","In terms of overall growth, I would highlight, we are continuing to maintain a calibrated outlook on LPD revenues. That is influenced by -- we still have some macro factors going on with African Swine fever and we are -- we didn\u2019t know are going to be up again some tough compare on health for screening, which is a relatively smaller business for us, but we had much better-than-expected growth this year in that area and we are cautious about some potential pullback on that as dairy producers in places like Australia, New Zealand for rebuild their herds in 2020. So, it\u2019s a smaller business for us, but at the margin that kind of reinforces to us our comfort levels with, the 9% to 10.5% overall organic growth outlook.","Jay Mazelsky","And Mike just in terms of the market itself we feel good about where the market is. As Brian indicated, we saw 2.7% clinical growth in Q3 over 5% revenue growth $5.3 million and that doesn\u2019t include new practice formations. So our outlook assumes that the market stays in that range.","Michael Ryskin","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jay, one for you in regards to Marshfield Labs. It\u2019s a little unique to see you purchasing lab assets, let alone in the U.S. So I am curious what the strategy was there, and then more specifically, outside of the lab network and the client base, you will get from that was there anything proprietary that can be broadened into the IDEXX labs existing network that you garner from the acquisition?","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. Ryan, thank you for the question. We are very excited by the Marshfield acquisition. It\u2019s a high-quality, very professional laboratory, we are adding approximately 2,000 Marshfield customers. These -- some of which we already do business with.","Our focus is really on being able to maintain continuity of service, understand the needs of those customers better and introduce some of the innovations that we have like SDMA and fecal antigen and VetConnect PLUS over time to them. So it\u2019s a -- we think it\u2019s a great acquisition, it\u2019s a great laboratory and it fits in well with our overall strategy.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. And then I may have missed this, this is a different question, but in commenting on the 8% uptick in Q4 on the North American customer facing organization. Is there a specific focus of the hires you are making there, if it\u2019s VetTech, is it field sales reps, is it anything in particular that it\u2019s kind of a focus and will you be changing the territories at all or is it just on many existing territories? Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","All right. Thank you, Ryan. Let me give you an overview of the model and I will give background on the why. Essentially, at its core, we are adding 23 territories and our model is we have a VDC per territory. So we will be going from 220 -- 227 territories to 250.","On average, the VDC today has about 110 accounts and post-implementation of the expansion will be down to about 100 and as is the case when we expand the number of VDCs, we augment the number of field service reps to support them, generally two VDCs per single FSR. So any addition to the 23 VDCs and new territories, we are adding 12 FSR. So that represents the core of the change.","And our thinking really is, when you take a look at our market. We have been growing strongly in the U.S. and the average business we do with the -- with our customers has grown. And so from both the depth and breadth standpoint, we have many customers that are 40%, 50% bigger in terms of the business they do with us just compared to three years ago.","Their expectation as they do more business with us is that they see more of us, whether it\u2019s full staff trainings or understanding their practice better, identifying opportunities where we can help them. And then you layer on top of that initiatives like preventive care, which take relatively more time of the VDC upfront, including things like on-boarding and getting those customers calling Marshfield Labs that I mentioned and the couple thousand of new customers. There\u2019s a real draw on the capacity of our commercial channel.","We tend to look -- there\u2019s a couple of metrics that we look at, that sort of guide our thinking about this. One is a reach to revenue metrics, so if you take a look at Q3, we are about 90% reached the revenue, which is where, historically, we like to be. But when you take a look at reached a customer, which incorporates not just IDEXX customers, but competitive customers, we are about 75% or so. So we are a bit lower than we would like to be. We think there\u2019s really good opportunity outside of the IDEXX installed base still. So that guided our thinking and how we implemented this.","Ryan Daniels","Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And I want to just wish my best to John as well. Thank you.","Jay Mazelsky","Thank you.","John Ravis","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","And you have a question from the line of Erin Wright. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. Do you know how much of the Marshfield customers are IDEXX customers on the point-of-care side or generally speaking, how much overlap, maybe there is, so we can think about like an opportunity for cross-selling and what does that put your U.S. lab count at now, following the Marshfield transaction? And then, can you kind of just broadly speak to the broader competitive environment across reference laboratory, are there any changes there? I know there have been some more competitive movements on the SDMA side or for kidney disease testing, I guess, how do you compare your SDMA capabilities at the reference lab compared to others? Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","All right. So there\u2019s -- I will take a few of those. There are a number of questions in there. As I indicated, there\u2019s about 2,000 in total Marshfield customers, many of whom we do business with currently. We haven\u2019t broke out the specifics in terms of in what modality across all the modalities.","Generally speaking, most customers in the U.S. do business with us and in some fashion, whether it\u2019s rapid assay or our software products. So we do think that there\u2019s a really nice opportunity to cross-sell, our full solutions. But our focus is really first on being able to understand those customer needs and work with them.","In terms of, you had mentioned specifically competition to SDMA. In our view, there are really no comparable offerings, the SDMA in the marketplace. We continue to make excellent progress, expanding SDMA adoption is differentiated. I gave you some statistics in terms of not only the reference lab but SDMA on the slide, with our catalyst.","We are super excited by the updated guidelines of virus that Elevates SDMA, really from an adjunct or chronic care disease treatment into a primary recommended diagnostics biomarker. Alongside puratone, of course, for staging of CKD, an important thing to keep in mind, in terms of the staging guidelines is that, veterinarians rely on them to classify by the patient, severity and progression of kidney disease.","So this guides that the treatment paths that they take, it helps the market standardize on best care approaches for the patient. It drives -- we think more standardized or better outcomes for the marketplace as a whole. It assures the pet parents that their pets getting the best treatment. So we think this is a really big deal and that\u2019s something we are excited by.","Erin Wright","Okay.","Brian McKeon","And Erin, we had 52 labs before -- in the U.S. before this and we will be adding a few additional locations, including the Core Lab for Marshfield, which we are as Jay mentioned it\u2019s a really high quality operation.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. And then, just generally speaking, also how would you characterize current demand trends across the veterinary market. I guess, you noted this slight acceleration in the clinical visit growth this quarter and what was driving that, you think, and is that normalized for the day impact as well? Thanks.","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. The -- I mean, we think the market is healthy, it\u2019s 2.7% clinical growth and that\u2019s the important metric that we track, because it involves -- those visits involve diagnostics testing. The overall practice growth is $1.4 million in revenue at 5.3% was pretty healthy.","It\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s largely consistent with what we have seen in the past. It does tend to be some variability quarter-to-quarter. We have got a pretty good beat on the market as a result of the -- our analytics approach with 7,500 practices. We take data from five of the leading PIM systems. So we have got a nice proportional both regional and practicized representation in this data and I think what it\u2019s showing is pretty consistent, strong growth across the market.","Brian McKeon","Hey, Erin. Just on the days impact clarified. Basically, what we had in Q3 was an extra Monday. And so what that really impacted was our business, we do a lot of shipping on Monday so sees positive benefits to consumables and rapid assay, which we highlighted and actually very limited impact on labs, and it wouldn\u2019t have really impacting the market metrics in that context, it\u2019s more of a shipping dynamic.","Erin Wright","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will go to the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the revenue guidance, Brian. I didn\u2019t hear a range for your expectations for the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth next year. I just wanted to know if you could kind of talk about the type of growth you expect and kind of what the key factors we should have in mind that would influence on the growth outlook for next year?","Brian McKeon","Yeah. we -- in our preliminary guidance we don\u2019t get that granular. We did want to highlight that in the 9% to 10.5% outlook we are looking to sustain the high level of growth that, this year we are guiding to 11.5% to 12%.","So all indications are we are trending quite well and looking to build on that as in the U.S. right now we are about 11.5% adjusted for days year-to-date and kind of 13.5% in international and international actually improved a bit in the quarter. We had relatively better reference lab growth, which is something we have been working on.","So we are looking to build on that, and we will be sharing more specifics as we get through the finalization of our planning process and we will share that on the year-end call.","Nathan Rich","Placement numbers that you gave, it looks like you saw some nice improvement internationally specifically in new and competitive placements. Could you maybe just talk about what drove that and specifically what you are seeing in China, I think that had been a little bit of a drag earlier this year, I just wondered, if you had seen improvement there?","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. So we saw really nice placement growth and consumables growth internationally, 20% normalized and I think if there is a couple of factors. It\u2019s clearly been an ongoing focus for us. I think the maturing of our VDC model, continuing maturing of our VDC model is helpful. We are getting nice traction with the IDEXX 360 program, with our international customer\u2019s, I think they appreciate what that brings in terms of flexibility in the ability to access our solutions.","And the products themselves, it fits our international markets really well, I think we have said in the past that Catalyst One was initially designed for international markets in terms of its cost profile and physical footprint and we just -- we continue to see that bit in our sales momentum and Brian\u2019s going to address the China question.","Brian McKeon","Yeah. China, we had a very good performance on new and competitive placements and we continue to work through the lapping of compares to prior levels where we had high levels of vet test upgrades. So the mix has shifted. We are -- that does constrain our overall revenue growth, reported revenue growth somewhat, but I think the underlying quality of the placements we are doing new and competitive accounts across regions, contributed very high quality performance from our lens in the quarter and the double-digit EVI gains that we talked about.","So, we feel good about the progress we are making across markets and that sets us up well. It\u2019s really about expanding our global installed base, and as Jay highlighted, we are up 18% year-on-year with our catalyst installed base globally, and that really sets a solid foundation for continuing to grow our consumable revenues at high rates.","Operator","We will go to the line of David Westenberg. Please go ahead.","David Westenberg","Hey. Thanks. Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So just first you noted customer shifting preferences to cloud based solutions. I know that PIMS has very high barriers and switching out seems it is rather on the difficult side. So are you having a lot of success in terms of switching customers or adding on that cloud -- the Cornerstone cloud solution, is that the way you kind of see the market shaking out? Can you just maybe run through competitive dynamics in that PIMS market, please?","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. So I will take that. Thank you for the question, David. The -- our PIMS offering is very broad. So we address the market in the -- more of the advanced workflow with Cornerstone, but also those practices that may be single or mobile practices with NEO.","And what we see is our veterinary customers like all customers, whether independent of industry, you appreciate ease of use benefits, they specifically focus at workflow, does it help them address the challenges, both from a care delivery standpoint, as well as a business standpoint in the practice.","And what they are telling us with Cornerstone 9.1, which is our most recent revision, is that they really appreciate the improvements we have made in user interface and the ability to do the work that they do with fewer clicks, with just all the easiest benefits.","So we are seeing really nice placements across the Board. It\u2019s included, as I had mentioned, in our IDEXX 360 program, so more customers are deciding, choosing to go all in with us in terms of diagnostics and software, what they find is when they do that, it works better.","In terms of Cornerstone Cloud, that as I indicated, is really in field trials. At this point, we think the marketplace over time will migrate at least in part, as you had indicated. PIM systems tend to be a bit sticky, but I think customers increasingly recognize that there are some benefits that having their software in the cloud in terms of lower cost for being able to maintain the hardware in the practices.","And somewhat more quick or a number of revisions that they can expect on an ongoing basis without having to shutdown their practices for an hour, two hours, that type of thing. So lots of benefits, we think, over time, that the market will move in that direction, and we will be ready for it. Yeah, keep in mind, our NEO practice management system is already in the cloud.","David Westenberg","All right. Well, thank you very much for the color. I am just going to do one really quick housekeeping question. I really do appreciate how you call out the extra day in the quarter. So I was just wondering in terms of housekeeping. Is there an extra day or one less day then in Q4 that we need to be -- that we need to anticipate and then maybe as we look at 2020, is there any kind of growth headwind in terms of extra days there, just as a housekeeping question.","Brian McKeon","On Q4, we will have one less Monday, but we anticipate some positive benefit around the holiday week time link. So I think it\u2019s a modest net headwind. There may be some modality impacts, but we are not calling that out and the team is telling me what the next year is -- it\u2019s relative -- we get some benefit in Q1 for leap year, but I think on the full year, it\u2019s relatively neutral.","David Westenberg","Appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Brian McKeon","Yeah.","Operator","We go to the line of Jon Block. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Jay, maybe the first one for you, just curious about the increased North American sales force, I guess, why now, I think, it was a couple of quarters ago, you said, you guys are sort of good with your commercial infrastructure and I get it. It\u2019s a business that responds well to increased investments. But just curious what you are seeing in the marketplace that caused you to move now versus maybe in a couple of quarters and then I have got a follow-up.","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. So Jon, I think, it really comes down to what I was describing earlier. A number of our customers, a large number of our customers in our territories have gotten bigger over time. And there\u2019s more demand from the VDC in terms of working with these customers. It\u2019s an expectation that they have as they use more broader and deeper.","And then when you take a look at some of these initiatives like preventive care, as I mentioned, they really do require more time upfront, in terms of getting these customers on-boarded and helping make them successful. You add in a couple of thousand more customers for Marshfield Labs.","As well as what we said at Investor Day, it\u2019s $11 billion addressable market, $3 billion in wellness business alone. So we continue to see that when we apply time with customers that they grow more and use more of our diagnostics and we do better. It really just comes down to that math.","Jon Block","Okay. Fair enough. And then Brian, maybe the second one for you on the guide, some moving parts on stock-based comp. I think largely in line, but the midpoint of revs was a tad below where we were. So I guess the question is, does this bake in what we may see from a new product standpoint in 2020, does it reflect that? And then part B that is just I thought you alluded to net interest expense of $36.5 million, which seems like a decent step-up year-over-year, despite rates continuing to go down. So I want to make sure I got the right number there and if so, why do we have a step-up? Thanks guys.","Brian McKeon","Yeah. Just on your first question, our outlook for 2020 incorporate projections for growth across the business including adoption of our current innovations and any new introductions. So that\u2019s factored in.","We feel it\u2019s very much in line with kind of how we have been trending. We always target growth, Jon, at the higher end of what we talk about, that\u2019s what we try to execute and just calibrate that appropriately. But we are looking to build on the strong growth rates and are very comfortable with the outlook in the context of our long-term goals.","And on your question related to interest expense, the -- it was $36 million and that included an assumption for -- we did not assume a change in interest rates. So I think that if there are reductions in things like variable interest rates we would there may be some modest benefit to that.","But that was our assumption and it assumes a flat net leverage ratio, so basically will -- we saw some benefit this year, reductions in interest rates, we are not projecting the underlying interest rate rejections into next year in the broader market.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Please go ahead. ","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, Brian, as we think about the 2020 guidance, I assume, you are contemplating the inclusion of Marshfield Labs. So it looks like Marshfield has about three or four Reference Labs, with particular strength in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio. One is, can you give us a sense of what your share was for Reference Lab in those regions and how you think that might bump it up? And then can you give us a sense for what level of growth you think that Marshfield could add in basis points to your reference lab line in 2020?","Brian McKeon","Yeah. So just on Marshfield, it\u2019s a lab with national customers. So we see this as adding to our national capability. Within our guidance, Mark, it is roughly $15 million, the annualized revenue we expect is about $15 million from Marshfield, that\u2019s what\u2019s baked in and it\u2019s offset by FX. So in terms of when you see our reported organic numbers those two factors offset.","So I would say, we have got that factored in. We are very excited about adding Marshfield to the IDEXX family and working with their employees and very pleased with their capabilities. And as Jay mentioned, I think there\u2019s real opportunities for us here nationally to leverage our innovations and expand our IDEXX business with those customers.","Mark Massaro","That\u2019s excellent. And so I also wanted to ask about potential expansion internationally. I believe you have over 900 people on the field globally, which is certainly a significant global infrastructure. But can you give us a sense for where you are at internationally and whether or not you are contemplating future sales hires OUS? And I guess, related to that, you have got the new lab in Germany opening up next year. Can you just speak to some of the dynamics in play both competitively and organically internally focused in Europe for 2020?","Jay Mazelsky","Yeah. So we are -- we just completed our expansion in Europe and internationally, and we are comfortable where we are. We think we have the right capacity to address the opportunity and our growth projections. So at this point, there\u2019s no additional plans to go beyond that.","It\u2019s really -- our focus at this point is really maturing out the organization. What we find is that it takes time to continue to develop deeper relationships with customers and with those deeper relationships where we are able to grow, so that\u2019s really the focus.","In terms of the Reference Lab marketplace, as Brian indicated earlier we are pleased with where we are right now. We are focused on being able to improve our reference lab performance and we think, over time, with the IDEXX 360 program and the maturing of our VDC sales organization, we can build on that. We are excited to be able to bring on the new Reference Lab in Germany, we think that, that positions us well additional capacity in the future but no other specifics at this point.","Jay Mazelsky","Okay. And okay -- so thank you. With that, we will conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q3 and the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"11520":["IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) Q2 2017 Earnings Call August  1, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Brian P.

McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks, good morning everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q2, building on our strong start to 2017. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $509 million reflected 10% organic revenue growth at the high-end of our expectations. Our growth continues to be driven by expansion of recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues, which increased 13% organically in the quarter to $380 million or 75% of total revenues. These gains were driven by 14% organic growth in the U.S. with strong gains across each of our modalities and 12% growth in international markets, despite a relatively tougher compare in Europe related to the later timing of the Easter holiday.","Strong revenue growth supported another excellent quarter of profit performance. Operating profit of $123 million, increased 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 180 basis point year-on-year improvement in gross margins, reflecting high recurring CAG Diagnostics growth, supported by moderate pricing gains and ongoing productivity improvement.","EPS for the quarter was $0.95 per share, an increase of 30% on a constant currency basis. These results included $0.08 per share or about 11% of EPS growth benefit from the adoption of new share-based compensation accounting guidance, which was also relatively higher than expected.","Reflecting our strong first half performance we're raising our full-year 2017 financial guidance today. We're increasing our 2017 revenue outlook by $17.5 million at midpoint to $1.945 billion to $1.965 billion. This reflects an updated outlook for organic revenue growth of 10% to 11% and approximately $13 million of benefit from changes to FX rate assumptions, reflecting the recent strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.","We're raising our full-year EPS guidance to $3.12 to $3.22, an increase of $0.14 at midpoint, reflecting approximately $0.04 of operational improvement, $0.02 per share in benefit related to favorable FX changes, net of hedge affects and approximately $0.08 per share related to raised projections for 2017 benefits from stock compensation accounting changes.","Our updated EPS outlook reflects expectations for full-year operating margin gains of 100 basis points to 125 basis points as reported or 110 basis points to 135 basis points of improvement on a constant currency basis, while we advance incremental commercial, R&D and enabling IT investments to position us for sustained strong organic revenue growth.","We'll review our updated 2017 outlook in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Q2 performance was again driven by our Companion Animal Group; global CAG revenues were $440 million, up 11% organically, supported by continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues and solid growth in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system businesses. These gains offset relatively lower instrument revenues reflecting comparisons to strong prior year placement levels and impacts from our increased emphasis on high economic value placements, which resulted in lower year-on-year second Catalyst placements and hematology upgrades in the U.S.","Water revenues of $29 million grew 7% organically in Q2, supported by solid gains in Europe and Latin America including benefits from our go-direct initiative in Brazil.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 4% organically to $34 million as we benefited from continued strong growth in China, improved performance in our herd health screening business and continued expansion of our recurring pregnancy testing franchise. These gains offset moderately lower revenues related to successful Europe bovine disease eradication programs and in our Dairy business reflecting market demand impacts related to lower milk pricing.","For the second half of 2017, we continue to target flat to modest growth in LPD overall. By region, U.S. revenues were $360 million, up 10% driven by high growth in our CAG business. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues in the U.S. grew 14% organically in Q2, reflecting strong double-digit gains in consumables and lab revenues and continued solid growth in rapid assay.","Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains continue to be primarily volume driven with overall net price gains trending at about 3% aided in the first half by some favorable year-on-year comparisons related to promotional activity. IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice growth, reflected in our data set from approximately 5,000 clinics.","In Q2, patient visits increased 2.8% and clinic revenues increased 6.8%, reflecting continued healthy market momentum. International revenues in the second quarter were $193 million reflecting 10% organic growth driven by 12% recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains. Recurring CAG growth continues to benefit from robust consumable gains driven by expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and related increases in average test utilization. These gains offset impacts from a later timing of the Easter holiday, which was in Q2 this year versus in Q1 last year, which moderated European CAG recurring revenue growth in the quarter as expected. For the first half overall, international recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues increased 15% organically, compared to the U.S. at 13% with strong gains across modalities and major regions.","In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostics testing modalities and continued expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally, we placed 2,680 premium analyzers in Q2, including 1,191 Catalysts, 861 premium hematology instruments and 628 SediVues.","We also placed 1,811 SNAP Pros in the quarter with accelerating momentum following our rollout of enhanced auto read capabilities. We continue to achieve high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America benefiting from our expanded commercial organization and our focus on maximizing the economic value. In Q2, we placed 341 Catalysts at competitive or greenfield accounts, a growth of 14% year-over-year. This represented 82% of total North American Catalyst placements.","International Catalyst momentum also continues to be strong with close to half of these placements going to new and competitive accounts. As we in parallel support the expansion of SediVue in a wider range of international markets. Globally our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 21% year-on-year in Q2, reflecting 11% year-on-year growth in North America and 37% year-on-year gains in international markets.","Global Instrument revenues for IDEXX were $28 million in Q2 down 13% organically, compared to strong prior year results, which included benefits from higher second Catalyst placements. In Q2 of 2016, we placed a 131 second Catalysts in North America as part of the successful customer retention program, which declined to 48 units this Q2, creating a headwind to report an instrument revenue growth this quarter. Note that while these second Catalyst placements contribute to instrument revenue, they do not on their own contribute meaningfully to incremental consumable revenue.","Our emphasis on the economic value or EVI of placements in the U.S. also shifted emphasis towards competitive Catalysts, SediVue and SNAP Pro placements, which resulted in relative declines in focus on hematology upgrades. We continue to be very pleased with the execution of this new approach, which resulted in double-digit year-on-year increase in our EVI metric related to North America instrument placements in the quarter.","Growth in our instrument customer base supported by high retention levels and utilization benefits from the expansion of the Catalyst platform in international markets is driving continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumable revenues of $132 million in Q2 grew 17% organically. These gains reflect continued high-teens organic growth in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. including benefits from the expansion of SediVue, which contributed 1.8% to global consumable gains in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $171 million, grew 13% organically in the second quarter, supported by higher growth in the U.S., which offset moderated international gains impacted by the later timing of the Easter holiday in Europe. Strong U.S. lab trends reflect continued momentum from the differentiation provided by SDMA, which is increasing customer retention, as well as from high growth in test panels with proprietary IDEXX parasitology and Lab 4Dx Plus Tests.","Rapid assay revenues also continued to trend very well with Q2 revenues of $60 million up 9% organically. Rapid assay gains reflect continued strong growth in 4Dx and specialty tests and progress regaining share in first generation products in the U.S. We expect rapid assay growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit growth range in the second half, as we begin to lap relatively stronger prior year performance levels and are impacted by select factors including fewer business days and less favorable year-on-year comparisons related to promotional activity.","Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues were $32 million in the quarter, up 9% organically. VSS gains continue to be driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base. Diagnostic imaging system revenues also increased solidly supported by growth in digital radiography-based placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $123 million, up 18% as reported or 19% on a constant currency basis, with results driven by very strong profit gains in our CAG business. Operating margins were 24.1%, up 180 basis points in the constant currency basis, driven by gross margin gains, reflecting continued strong momentum and expanding CAG recurring diagnostic revenues supported by moderate price gains and ongoing productivity improvement aided by volume leverage.","For the first half of 2017, we delivered approximately 220 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis, building on the 170 basis points of adjusted constant currency improvement, delivered for the full year of 2016. The new guidance we're providing today indicates we're on track towards 280 basis points to 305 basis points of adjusted constant currency operating margin improvement combined in 2016 and 2017, well ahead of our long-term goals.","We're delivering these results while advancing increased investments in certain areas, aligned with sustaining our accelerated revenue growth. These investments will moderate our year-on-year operating margin improvement in the second half of 2017 compared to our very strong first half gains. We'll talk more about our second half outlook as we review our updated 2017 guidance.","For Q2, reported gross profit was $293 million, up 12% or 14% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefit gross profit, were $750,000 in Q2.","Operating expenses in Q2 were up 9%, driven primarily by higher investment in sales and marketing resources. Expense growth increased in Q2 as we began advancement of incremental investments in U.S. commercial capability with some delay in the initial phasing \u2013 in the phasing of initial ramping costs, which created favorability in our Q2 results compared to our quarterly outlook. We expect to see higher levels of year-on-year operating expense growth in the low teens range in the second half of 2017 related to increased U.S. commercial resources, enabling IT programs and R&D initiatives.","We also recently announced the acquisition of rVetLink which will add an important dimension to our growing software and connectivity capability. This acquisition and related development initiatives will add about $2 million to $3 million of incremental operating expense in H2 of 2017, including transition costs with limited initial incremental revenues. These costs are factored into our updated financial outlook.","EPS in Q2 was $0.95 per share, including $0.08 per share in benefit from adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. Tax benefits from share-based compensation continue to trend higher than originally projected, reflecting the significant recent appreciation of our stock price and higher levels of activity related to the expiration of specific stock compensation grants.","For the full-year, we now project benefits from adoption of the new accounting guidance in the range of $0.30 to $0.34 per share or about $0.08 per share higher than our last estimates. This is obviously a dynamic area and higher levels of benefits in 2017 reflect timing of stock option grants and effects from the significant recent increase in our stock price.","As we'll discuss in clarifying our tax rate outlook, we projected about $13 million of the after tax benefit we expect to see in 2017 or about $0.15 per share will not flow through to future years. Aside from the benefits from the new accounting adoption, Q2 EPS results were supported by share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 1% net of a 0.5% negative impact related to adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance.","Our effective tax rate was 25.5% in Q2, including 6.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption, foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q2 2016 and 2017, lower quarterly operating profit by $1.4 million and EPS by $0.01 per share. Free cash flow was $95 million for 2017 in Q2, on track with our full-year outlook for free cash flow of approximately 95% of net income and projected full-year capital spending of $90 million.","Our outlook for continued strong free cash flow generation, aligned with our very strong business momentum, supports allocation of capital to share repurchases. In Q2, we deployed $114 million to repurchase 700,000 shares in the open market bringing year-to-date repurchases to $165 million for 1.1 million shares or an average price of $152 per share. We ended Q2 with $1.309 billion in debt outstanding, $423 million in cash and investment balances and $145 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.","Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances.","Turning to our 2017 outlook. As noted, we're increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance ranges, we're raising our reported revenue guidance by $17.5 million at midpoint to $1.945 billion to $1.965 billion, reflecting our expectation for organic revenue growth of 10% to 11%, as well as about $13 million in revenue benefits from relatively more favorable foreign-exchange rate changes.","At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we now project that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by about 0.5% in 2017, related to the year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","In terms of our operating margin outlook, as noted, we're projecting annual improvement on a reported basis of 100 basis points to 125 basis points, which equates to 110 basis points to 135 annual basis point improvement on a constant-currency basis. This higher constant-currency outlook reflects our strong first-half performance and momentum in growing CAG recurring diagnostic revenues.","For the second half, we expect operating margin gains will moderate as we lap strong prior-year gross margin performance and invest in expanding our regional customer-facing capability in the U.S., advance our R&D and enabling IT agenda and integrate the rVetLink acquisition.","In terms of EPS, we're raising our 2017 outlook to $3.12 to $3.22 per share or an increase from our previous $2.95 to $3.11 range or approximately $0.14 per share or higher at midpoint. This equates to 17% to 19% EPS growth adjusted for currency changes and share-based compensation accounting impacts, aligned with the long-term financial goals.","Our higher EPS outlook is driven by three factors; first, we're projecting $0.04 in operational benefit, related to our strong organic growth trends and our raised full year constant currency operating margin outlook. Note that this reflects about $0.06 of projected operating improvement offset by about $0.02 of impact from the rVetLink acquisition.","Second, favorable FX changes are projected to contribute $0.02 of benefit compared to our last guidance assumptions. At the rates assumed in our press release, FX changes are projected to reduce 2017 operating profit by $7 million and EPS by $0.03 per share, net of a projected $3 million or $0.03 per share benefit from hedges.","In terms of our 2017 outlook as a sensitivity to rates assumed in our press release, a 1% weakening of the dollar across our currencies would raise 2017 revenues by $3.5 million and operating profit by about $900,000 net of hedge impacts. Please note that while not all of the favorable FX change year-to-date will benefit 2017 results given previously established hedge positions. These changes, if they hold, will benefit future years as hedge contracts expire.","Third, as noted, we expect $0.08 per share of incremental benefit from adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. On our last call, we had estimated that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 32% prior to these impacts, and we're maintaining that outlook. In terms of benefits from reflecting the tax deductibility of share-based compensation in our P&L under the new accounting guidance, we're raising our expected tax rate benefits on these fronts for the full-year of 2017 to 7% to 8%.","This reflects in an updated estimated, in an updated estimate for our 2017 full year effective tax rate of 24% to 25% and this assumes an effective tax rate for the second half of 2017 of 26% to 27%, somewhat higher than the first half, reflecting accelerated option exercise activity earlier this year. The projections for our effective tax rate in 2017, aligned with an estimated $27 million to $30 million benefit in tax reduction related to share-based compensation activity. As noted, a portion of the tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors, including the timing of exercise of stock options which are not expect to carry over into future periods, based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity.","For future years, we estimate that the annual benefit from share-based compensation activity will be $14 million to $17 million, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. This is approximately $13 million below projections for 2017, which equates to about 3.5% of tax rate benefit in 2017 or $0.15 per share EPS benefit, which we do not anticipate will carry over into future periods.","Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. We're projecting net interest expense of approximately $33 million, assuming a relatively consistent current gross leverage ratio. In terms of our third-quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q3 reported revenue growth in the 9% to 10% range, reflecting organic gains of 9.5% to 10.5% offset by a modest FX headwind.","As noted in earlier calls, we will see a 1% reduction in organic revenue growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2017 related to fewer business days, which is factored into our outlook. Year-on-year operating margin improvement in Q3 is expected to be 0 to 50 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior-year third quarter. This equates to 10 basis points to 60 basis points of constant-currency improvement.","While we're targeting continued solid operating margin improvement, Q3 gains will be moderated reflecting higher levels of operating expense growth, from our U.S. commercial expansion, R&D initiatives and acquisition integration, as noted. We're targeting solid continued gross margin improvement, but also expected moderated level of year-on-year gross margin improvement for Q3, compared to very strong first half gains.","That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for this comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay, hey, thank you, Brian. Indeed a strong quarter with constant-currency revenue and EPS gains and an outlook for the year that is at the high end of our long-term growth goals. This reflects continued strong market growth and outstanding execution by our teams with our highly impactful direct sales coverage model, driving an even higher growth for our business. Also the weaker dollar provides a tailwind as we're a net exporter of technology products.","Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 13% constant-currency benefited from exceptional performance from our U.S. commercial team, achieving 14% CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Some notable accomplishments in North America, double-digit growth in the productivity of instrument placements using our economic value index, which measures the value of different instrument placements in contributing to recurring revenue growth and profitability.","Note that we didn't have a significant change in the field resources in place that are responsible for instrument placements over last year's quarter. So this is essentially all productivity. In Q3, we have in place the expansion of our U.S. sales organization. Part of this EVI was contributed by 14% growth in competitive Catalyst placements year-over-year and SediVue placements continued to be strong.","Reference lab growth in the U.S. pulled up the global average for this CAG Diagnostic modality. And in rapid assay, our field professionals achieved tremendous momentum in placing SNAP Pro units at over 1,800 for Q2, the vast majority in North America, which grew 300% year-over-year. SNAP Pro is giving our field professionals a great reason to talk about our highly differentiated rapid assay SNAP line, which saw another quarter of strong growth, led by SNAP 4Dx Plus in the North American market.","Clearly, even after 15 years in the market vector-borne disease testing, aka tick-borne disease, remains a developing market and by highlighting SNAP Pro and the SNAP line in general, our commercial organization is bringing new attention to the importance of vector-borne disease screening with 4Dx. In fact, we just released a seminal analysis that uses big data to demonstrate a significant increased risk of chronic kidney disease with dogs exposed to the tick-borne diseases of Lyme or Ehrlichia. So, now we appreciate that testing for exposure to tick-borne disease is more important than ever.","We also appear to be continuing to recover the volumes in first-generation rapid assay sales that eroded during the transition to the fully direct in 2015. In Q3, we have put in place a 12% expansion of the sales force in the U.S. market with additional territories. The hiring and training associated with this expansion is essentially complete and we have about 430 field-based professionals in place to start the new quarter. With the expansion we have both new reps to IDEXX and a U.S. territory reconfiguration that evolves about 8% of accounts with a change in IDEXX account professional.","We anticipate some moderation in U.S. growth in H2 over the very strong year-to-date performance as it typically takes at least a quarter for reps to settle into their new territories and we will be up against relatively tough compares in rapid assay that will moderate growth from the very strong first-half gains. We also have about 1% of growth headwind with fewer business days.","Having said that, our model of customer coverage has proven to be exceptionally successful in both growing the market for diagnostics for customers that use IDEXX, the expanded toolkit and also look forward to the benefits of this further-expanded U.S. commercial presence over time. As we move into 2018 with this expansion fully settled into place, we'll also benefit from productivity initiatives such as fully leveraging our new customer relationship management system, up the EVI model for instrument placements, as well as more effective digital marketing support. And of course, we will have significant new product introductions.","Europe was solid in Q2 with CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth impacted by year-over-year timing of Easter, which is a major four-day holiday in Europe unlike the U.S. And as we indicated, this would be the case. Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to be our fastest-growing global regions. Global gains continue to be driven by the expansion of the Catalyst customer base generating high-teens year-over-year consumable gains with years of runway ahead.","We are seeing an increasing percentage of international Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts, reaching almost 50% in the second quarter. Overall, our CAG dynamics are very strong globally with a unique innovation driven growth, high and improving customer retention, strong pricing gains and high profit flow-through enabling us to support growth investments while delivering strong financial results.","Let me turn to a couple of technology pipeline updates. We are very pleased to add the rVetLink team to IDEXX in Q2. rVetLink is an exceptionally successful cloud-based application that solves the issue of communication and medical record sharing between the specialty referral hospitals and their referring DVM clients. rVetLink adds an attractive recurring revenue business model to IDEXX that will also further add value to our practice information management systems offerings, including Cornerstone, DVMAX and Neo in North America.","All three of these practice information management systems are strategic product offerings that will also continue to be a development priority, including, but certainly not limited to embedding the rVetLink functionality. The rVetLink acquisition comes with a seasoned and talented leadership team. We welcome them to the IDEXX family and their SaaS-based solutions to the IDEXX ecosystem. Of note, rVetLink is the seventh in a growing ecosystem of cloud-based offerings offered by IDEXX.","We also continue to see great opportunities to address our customer information technology needs with our ecosystem of products, including both client-server and cloud-based platforms by taking client-server applications to the cloud and through leveraging the data that is created by these systems. These continue to be R&D investment priorities for IDEXX.","We remain on track for two important product launches within the next year, as I referenced earlier, Catalyst SDMA and SNAP Fecal. Both products will generate direct revenues. Importantly, they also add value to the entire IDEXX diagnostic offering and thus provide a multiplier effect on the growth of our core recurring diagnostic revenue.","Let's take a look at each. Catalyst SDMA, a new slide for Catalyst, will contribute to instrument revenues directly, as it is a new test. In addition, the new test makes Catalyst instrument even more unique, supporting the expansion of our in-house chemistry customer base. Finally, by providing SDMA on Catalyst, we accelerate the growing recognition of SDMA as an essential parameter to the core chemistry panel, whether run at the point of care on an instrument or sent to the reference lab.","We are on track to introduce Catalyst SDMA by the end of 2017 in the North American market. As expected, with estimated annual revenue growing to roughly $50 million or more within five years for this one test alone on Catalyst. SNAP Fecal will become in time a major category of our rapid assay business, directly adding to the annual revenue growth with potential rapid assay revenue in five years, also of about $50 million or more.","SNAP Fecal also has a multiplier effect and that it adds value and attention to the SNAP family and makes SNAP Pro even more valuable as a device that assists in practices in running all SNAP products in the family, thus supporting our entire rapid assay product line. SNAP Fecal also brings further attention to our unique Fecal antigen technology, which is used in SNAP Pro and also used at the reference lab, for those customers who prefer a send-out protocol for their Fecal testing and yet value the unprecedented accuracy advantage that antigen technology adds to traditional methods. Again, we remain on track for the launch of SNAP Fecal in mid 2018 as expected.","Both of these products are examples of how IDEXX innovation is uniquely driving profitable growth of veterinary diagnostics and thus IDEXX's CAG recurring revenues. We are combining new and augmented technologies with evidence-based medical insight, increasing the clinical value of diagnostic testing and thus the motivation and justification to run more testing. And we know that pet owners prioritize spending on their pets when the benefit to the health of their pet is apparent to them as it is with this medical-based insight that we're bringing to the market.","With this differentiated and augmented set of medical tools, it is no surprise that IDEXX's veterinary customers are growing their usage of diagnostics faster than the market as a whole to the benefit of the pet and the pet owner, the veterinary practice and to IDEXX. This dynamic is one of the reasons we remain confident in the long-term target of 10% plus constant currency revenue growth for IDEXX as a whole.","So, with those opening comments, we'll now open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Jon Block form Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Maybe two. The first one just your thoughts on international CAG recurring traction. I think it was plus 17% in the first quarter, still a robust 12%, but slowed to 12% in 2Q. You guys certainly called out the timing of Easter, but just want to make sure anything else at play there, the step down from 17% to 12%, were there any markets in Europe that may have pulled back a little bit, maybe if you can just \u2013 can provide some overall color across the international landscape specific to CAG recurring? And then I've got a follow up.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, great. Thank you. It's a big holiday in Europe, Easter four-day holiday, and it was in the first quarter last year and then second quarter this year. So I think the best way to look at Europe is the first half growth and that sort \u2013 that normalizes for that. That was 15% recurring revenue growth internationally versus 13% for the U.S. So that's that 200-basis-point delta that we typically see.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. If you adjust both quarters for that, Jon, it's a pretty consistent trend.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, okay. Brian and then, of course, I got to push you a little bit on the leverage. The guidance implies a pretty big step-down in the amount of constant currency operating margin expansion in 2H relative to what we saw in 1H. Of course, Jon, you've alluded to the increased investments that you guys have made more recently. Brian, I guess, maybe two things, how do we think about that leverage as we go into 2018? Maybe you can give us some details around the timing of it. In other words, do you absorb the heightened level of spend in 3Q and 4Q and then we go to a more normal cadence once we enter into 2018? Thanks guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We'll obviously provide more clarity on that as we get towards our preliminary guidance. But I think what we're signaling is that we're going to have low teens OpEx growth in the back half of this year and you would expect, just given lapping, Jon, some of that's going to carry over into the first half of 2018. As we add the resources, we'll obviously have a higher level of resources that we have in the prior year. We're still confident that we can deliver good operating margin improvement. We do think it's going to be moderated because of that in the second half, along with just some relatively less favorable compares on the gross margin front. But we feel good about being positioned to continue to deliver our 50 basis points to 100 basis points of annual operating margin improvement on a constant-currency basis which is our long-term goal, and we'll share more insight on that as we get closer to 2018.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Jon, I just want to add to those appropriate comments by Brian. Obviously, the investments in the U.S. organization have generated a very attractive return in accelerating growth of the recurring diagnostic revenue that we've seen in the first half of this year, 13%, and the second quarter being 14%. I think what we're finding is the more we call on customers the faster they adopt our more expanded toolkit of diagnostics, and it turns out when you have more tools you use them more frequently and they find more disease and this is a reinforcing dynamic.","And so while it takes a little while for this \u2013 it'll take a little bit while for this 12% expansion to settle in, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've got some very significant productivity initiatives that are already in play, that we're already seeing the benefits from, combined with some additional new product launches with the SDMA on Catalyst, which is going to be very, very big for us in the North America market, even in the global market. And SNAP Fecal which will be very, very big for us in the North American market where Fecal testing is already an established protocol, mostly using in-house microscopy manual method. So we think these are proven to be very attractive ROI investments. But as Brian mentioned, they take a little time to kick in.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. I'll follow up on the instruments offline. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-ups on some of the investments you're making. I guess number one on the expansion in the customer facing units. I'm curious, as you spend more time with vets and techs, if your teams are not only focusing on educating them on your products and product launches, but also how to increase overall lab utilization with pet owners, meaning wellness program initiatives, seasonal screenings, parasitic outbreaks et cetera that drive greater utilization at the point of care?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Ryan, actually it's a great question and we're seeing our customer grow faster whether they're growing \u2013 one of the drivers of reference lab growth is the same-store sales with our customers. As Brian mentioned in his comments that's being driven in part by some of the technologies were being in the market, Fecal antigen testing is really taking off in the reference lab and driving same-store sales growth and 4Dx when customers choose to send that to the lab.","We also have some very successful programs to drive the growth in preventive care with our customers, which \u2013 and we're going to talk a little bit more about this at the Analyst Day, but the medical justification of running diagnostics in a preventive care across both dogs and cats and all ages is very, very strong and yet still really very, very underutilized. So when our veterinarian \u2013 when our diagnostic or veterinary \u2013 VDCs, the veterinary diagnostic consultants engage with customers towards advancing a preventative care, we see a very dramatic growth in their usage of IDEXX diagnostics. This is a much higher growth and it really shows they're starting to kick in the gear. And of course, one of our cloud-based offerings, Petly Plans, aids in the adoption of a preventive care plan, which, while it's not necessary can be helpful to growing a preventative care diagnostics in the customer.","So, all of these are trends we see were just starting to crack the code on this accelerated utilization, because we have unique tools, they find more disease, it's sort of a virtuous cycle, customers see the success, they see the clinical efficacy, they see that they are raising the standard of care, they're helping pet owners and pets find and treat these disease earlier. Pets are living longer lives and so they want to do more of it. This virtuous cycle with the customers that are IDEXX customers is a very, very positive. And of course, then we're adding new customers that start to enter this virtuous cycle of utilization growth. It all happens over time, but these are enduring growth dynamics for us.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful color. And then as my follow-up one on the R&D spend. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about how much of that is currently going towards commercialization or development of some of the products you've already announced, like moving SDMA on to Catalyst and the SNAP Fecal versus focusing on novel testing areas on the pure research front? Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, we have \u2013 it's really all of the above. We, of course, support existing products, for example, our \u2013 as I mentioned seven cloud-based offerings and our practice information management system, these are software offerings that are continuing to add a functionality. We see the opportunity to leverage cloud technology with our client-server applications over time.","So in the software area, it's not \u2013 it's new, but it's also really expansion and growing the value of that entire ecosystem and how it works together seamlessly to drive very, very attractive clinical and financial outcomes for our customers.","Of course, we've got the new products that we've announced SDMA on the slide, which is going to be really big for us and we're right on track for the launch at the end of the year. And then SNAP Fecal, which will be \u2013 the SNAP Fecal will be the most significant product launch since 3Dx in 2002. And as I mentioned in my comments, 15 years later, we're still seeing growth in vector-borne disease testing. These are very, very long-enduring cycles and so we're going to start a whole \u2013 another long-enduring cycle with the SNAP Fecal.","Of course, we have other things in our pipeline that we haven't discussed yet because in many cases, these are a multiyear development efforts. But I'm going to tell you, what our commercial organization is very busy with our current and projected offerings. In some cases, Ryan, we have to hold things back. And so let me just give you an example. We have a great new test on Catalyst called CRP. This is an inflammatory marker, chemistry marker. We launched in Europe because the European market appreciates \u2013 certain countries in the European market appreciate the benefit of CRP. The U.S. market is completely uneducated on CRP. We haven't even launched it in the U.S. We don't want to \u2013 we're going to launch it eventually, but we just don't want to try to do too many things and each of them half done. And so, we are not gated by new \u2013 the innovation, we're more gated by the commercialization.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Can you speak to kind of how the incremental sales force in commercial investments that you've already made to-date are taking hold, I guess, what are you seeing quarter-to-date or the sales force that perhaps ramping up according to plan and how should we think about that influencing the quarterly progression as instrument placement trends in the next two quarters? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. As I've mentioned, it's a 12% expansion and the vast majority of that is reducing the number of customers that a rep is servicing and thus increasing the intensity of the calls, creating a stronger relationship. So that involves some territory reconfiguration and about 8% of our accounts will therefore have a new rep. Sometimes they're just \u2013 they're an existing rep, but they're new to that portion of the territory and of course other times it's a rep that's new to IDEXX.","As we've done with the expansion in 2015, the added reps are very highly experienced and occasionally they also come from the very territory with some other animal health OEM. But it does take time to learn our product line and it does take time to get settled in and we typically see that's going to be a quarter of investment and then they start to sort of begin to pay for themselves in the second quarter, but then we have a long period as they grow their relationships and their competency, where we see growing productivity.","But of course, we also have the benefit of ongoing relationships with the other 92% that aren't changing as a result of this expansion and we will be adding, as part of this expansion, we're adding in the second half year more professional service veterinarians which are highly appreciated by the customer and we've also added more of the field support reps, which are involved in the adoption of these protocol changes. So it's a \u2013 we've seen that as we add intensity of coverage, we see very nice response with our customers who adopt diagnostic protocols faster, and it's such a deep market. Everything that suggests it's such a deep market that this has good ROI, Erin. Thank you.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And then on SediVue, can you speak to how the feedback has been in the field and placements were pretty strong, has there been any surprises from a consumable utilization standpoint per customer and can you speak to ways you could potentially enhance the utility of SediVue or potentially better leverage the algorithmic interpreted software? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, thank you very much for that comment. We saw really nice customer response to the Neural Network 2.0 software offering, which as you know just gets launched behind the scenes, fully launched in the early part of second quarter. And that continued to advance the diagnostic algorithms. That's not the last one, we're going to have another one in the first quarter of 2018, called Neural Network 3.0 that will continue to leverage the tens of millions of images that we're getting.","I would say again everybody wants this to happen faster. We think that urine is underutilized. We know that roughly 50% of the urine that is run on SediVue provides results that are medically significant, meaning, some kinds of observations in the urine that is very medically significant and helps rule in certain types of diseases.","That's a very high rate, close to 50%. We ran a free UA day, which we can do because of the pay per run, where they only pay when they run the analyzer. We say when you run the analyzer, this one day, you don't have to pay. And we saw over 600 customers run seven times the amount of urine that they would have run on a normal day.","And on the incremental results, we found over a third of those results provided remarkable diagnostic findings. This just shows underutilized urinalysis is. Our current projection is still 3,000 or 4,500 per year in recurring revenue per instrument placement. We hope to grow that gradually over time; we're around 1.1 runs per day on average. Obviously, some customers are higher than that, other customers are lower. But the opportunity to run and the value of running urinalysis is still very, very significant and, of course, SediVue makes it easier to do so. It's one of these protocol changes that allow customers to grow their diagnostic utilization without heavy load on the technician productivity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, yes. Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, great. Thank you. Sorry, I'm remote today. So, when you launch SDMA on the Catalyst, clearly an important product launch, how do we think about the incremental consumable pull through as we look into 2018? And what does that do, do you think to the consumable numbers, I'm just curious. And then how do you look at \u2013 do you have any data on how many of people that are sending out to your services just do SDMA only and have Catalyst systems. I'm just curious on potential utilization that way?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","There's all sorts of interesting good things that happen and yet they've all happened slowly over time, now when they \u2013 when a customer adds SDMA to a Chem CLIP that'll be an incremental roughly $7 for us. And so really the question is to what degree will we see customers adding the SDMA slide to the Chem CLIP over time. And that'll be a gradual thing just like it was with when we launched the T4 on Catalyst and it adds a small amount, but every year it adds \u2013 continues to add more and more. And so \u2013 but the other thing that we know is that we have a cohort of customers that have our full in house suite including Catalyst, but don't use us for the reference lab, but because they're in a contract they can't get out.","But they value SDMA and so we may see a shift towards more full panels being run in-house with this cohort of customers, again these are very difficult things to model, but we're really seeing very nice traction in SDMA being more and more viewed as an essential element of the routine chemistry panel and for those customers that have Catalyst, this will be \u2013 but don't \u2013 are don't have ready access to our reference labs, this will be a way that they can change to that protocol, so.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","As Jon noted, we estimated over five years, we think they can build a $50 million and or more. So...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That would be $50 million in just Catalyst revenue associated with the SDMA slide, that's our estimate. That doesn't include the multiplier effect of growing utilization or growing the recognition of SDMA, or growing our reference lab or all the other things that we believe this will help.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up. I really appreciate the commentary on the SPC tax implication, that a lot of the other companies that are reporting these gains are calling out the fact that they're going to have headwinds in 2018 from this. So I'm just curious, is there a general, is there any rule of thumb to think about incremental X amount of increase in the stock price, could potentially drive an incremental benefit from this, I know timing of these options is really hard to do, but I'm just wondering if there is any sort of rule of thumb we can use?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Don't have that handy, I think that's something we can try to bring some clarity to over time because that obviously has one impact, and the other impact, that's harder predict, is how do people behave. So, I apologize we don't have that specifically...","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We don't have that specifically, but that's a \u2013 as we continue to work on our PhD and stock share-based compensation impacts, we'll add some of that over time.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","No, problem.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys, congrats on another strong quarter. Just want to talk a little bit about margins in sales force density, as you look at your commercial infrastructure. At what point in time, do you think that we perhaps will level out there a bit more. And then think about maybe accelerating the long-term guidance on margin improvement?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think the \u2013 we've gone through some phases on the increases in our sales and marketing capability. I think the history has shown, this has been a very high return area for investment, we're obviously focused on growing our core business. We did a reset, if you will, once we went direct, and I think that you see the benefit of that playing out now and we've got a more modest reset here going on in the next few quarters.","I think over time, we do think we can get leverage out of sales and marketing, but we want to always leave the opportunity open to invest incrementally towards incremental growth, we're growing the market, we think this requires resources, and we'll continue to monitor that over time. And that's all factored into our long-term view of the 50 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. I think that there's potential to deliver more on that, but we want to balance that with always having an eye towards the significant long-term potential we see for growth in this company. And we'll \u2013 as we move towards Investor Day, we're going to \u2013 we'll be spending more time on that and helping you understand the benefits of that approach.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the comments, Nick. Just to add to that, margin expansion is a good thing, Brian mentioned with our new guidance we'll have 280 to 305 basis points on an adjusted constant currency basis over the combined two-year period, 2016-2017. Margin expansion is a good thing, organic growth is a good thing, accelerating organic growth is a good thing. Some of that comes from incremental investments, of course, that also helps with gross margin expansion. I think it's a very favorable dynamic that we are \u2013 that we are working here.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for that color. And then just on the reference lab, certainly it's interesting to see your U.S. growth continue to accelerate relative to your peer group that's seeing some level of moderation. So just maybe want to dig a little bit deeper into the share gains that you're seeing in the U.S.? And then more importantly, where are we in the cycle of your guys' gross margins within the reference lab as we think about that being a pretty big lever for growth longer-term in operating income? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes. Thank you for those comments. I want to comment that our reference labs are doing very, very well in the U.S. market. A significant portion of that is the same-store sales growth from our customer base. And because they're adopting some of our unique differentiated offerings that aren't available to customers that don't use our reference lab. And this really comes from the fact that our veterinary diagnostic consultants are \u2013 their commission is based on territory revenue growth. And that comes from any CAG recurring diagnostic growth including same-store sales and reference labs. And so, we're really seeing a nice growth again in the Fecal antigen area, in the reference lab version of 4Dx and some of the specialty tests.","And then, when we add a new customer \u2013 oh, by the way that growth also means that customers are adopting protocols that are only unique to IDEXX. And it increases the retention of our IDEXX reference lab customers, and of course, the retention is increased as they appreciate that SDMA is an essential element of their routine chemistry panels. So, we're seeing gradually improving off of very strong retention ratios. And then, as we add a new customer, what's really interesting is they start growing faster, with the reference lab utilization.","And then, we're going to share this with \u2013 the results with \u2013 at Analyst Day, which I think investors know will be a Reg FD event, everybody will have the benefit of this. We also note that actually customers that run more in-house diagnostics grow their reference lab business; they're higher reference lab growers. It turns out, and we're going to show this with big data. Testing begets testing. The more in-house testing that customers do, the more reference lab testing they do, it's an amazing dynamic.","These are our customers because these are all \u2013 a reinforcing integrated offering. I can't comment on with regard to customers that don't use us, because they don't have the tools, the toolset, the expanded toolset that we're providing. But it's an interesting dynamic. One would normally think, hey, if I'm going to do more in-house, I do less reference lab. No, the more in-house you do, the more reference lab you do. And so that's another factor that's contributing to the growth in our reference lab business. And indeed, the expansion of the diagnostic market with customers who are using IDEXX expanded toolkit.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'll leave it at two. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And one moment please. Our next question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and then, congrats on another good quarter.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Can you just give a little bit more color on the free SediVue utilization \u2013 the free SediVue utilization day in terms of what you might have saw afterwards. Was there a spike, was there a continuous usage in those customers that used it? And if that is the case, is this something you might do on a regular basis, if testing begets testing in this particular case?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. It was an exceptionally successful market initiative that actually had very, very high ROI, because the foregone revenue and the marketing costs on it were relatively low. We're just now fully beginning to appreciate as a result of digging into the big data, how profound impact it had on the patient care. But like everything in veterinary medicine, changes in clinic protocols, they happen slowly, they may happen with a subset of customers very rapidly. As I said, we have 600 to 700 customers, who really participated in the UA Day in such a way that they greatly expand their testing that day. But, of course, that's a small fraction of our SediVue installed base in North America.","But it is \u2013 it shows the power of the pay per run model and some of the creative marketing that we can do with that. And I suspect that we'll continue to find ways to drive the utilization growth because the opportunity is so large in relation to the current standards. It's hard to parse all this out in terms of the impact that it's having because you've got seasonal factors. We've only been in the market for a year; we barely have year-over-year data. Obviously, there's a little bit more testing that's run in the summer when practices are busier than run in the winter.","And so, but it's got to be a good dynamic, as I said, we're right now about 1.1 runs per day, it's really shocking how low that is. And I think even vets themselves are shocked with how low that is. So we see the opportunity to grow that. But I'm not going to say, it's going to change to 1.5 overnight, this takes time. And of course, we're continuing to grow the install base in the meantime.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just a very, very quick clarification question, you mentioned the slide pricing of SDMA being $7. Was that up from $5 or was it always $7?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We're just getting closer to launch and we're getting closer to what \u2013 this would be a bundled price if they buy it. The list price for the SDMA slide will be $16 or $17, but we'll have a bundled discount when they buy it with a CLIP which should be the incremental price of the SDMA when you add it to a CLIP purchase, that will be about $7 and this is specific to U.S. These are U.S. numbers. So we're just getting a little bit more specific on that as we get closer to the launch.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Fine.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I don't think we fully, we finalized it. But I think we're \u2013 that's pretty close to the neighborhood we're going to be in, in the bundled discount pricing which we would expect would be the majority of the slide-only purchases.","Of course, the majority of our customers also run T4 in combination with their panel and when they add SDMA to their T4, they will come at no incremental charge. But that's a very low, T4 which is just underutilized too. So less than 10% of Catalyst run in the U.S. add a T4. So the vast majority of what we think will be the impact will be SDMA added to the CLIP without T4; although it may grow T4 utilization too. It's just a lot of moving parts, they're all good. We just don't know what degree they will move in and at what rate.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you very much and I look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks and again congrats on a good quarter.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Max, (01:04:48) on for Mark. Thanks for the question and congrats on the strong quarter. So first, SediVue, can you speak to the number of countries you're launched in today? And perhaps could you add come color about where you're launched now and where you're expecting to launch later this year?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for that question. We are, over the course of the first half of 2017, we launched in the major European countries, some of those were first quarter, some of those were second quarter and we're also launched in Australia. And but I'm going to tell you what's interesting is SediVue is playing a nice role, but the big, big opportunities in these markets continue to the Catalyst placements, which are a lot for an individual instrument they have a higher impact on growth and recurring revenues of the consumable \u2013 the instrument consumables. So in other words, they're EVI, the EVI of a Catalyst placement is still significantly higher than the EVI of a SediVue placement.","So therefore SediVue plays a \u2013 what I would call a supporting role, but it's not a primary role. It supports winning competitive customers, it supports advancing existing customers, filling out the suite, but really the primary objective for instrument placements internationally even more so in the U.S. is continuing to take to upgrade or put in the Catalyst, which are, are what's generating that high teens VetLab consumable growth that we're seeing in the international markets. But we \u2013 it did contribute the international SediVue placements did contribute to meaningfully to the year-over-year growth in SediVue the 628 units that we place globally. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Great, thanks, and as a follow-up in terms of monetizing your patient data, I know it's an extremely small percentage of your business today. Do you foresee any new verticals or areas where your lab data may be used to help some of your partners develop greater insights, whether it's in pet food or perhaps in new areas of pharmaceuticals?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","This is really very early days. What we're really finding, right, and we \u2013 of course we do have a data business where we support some of the other players in the industry as you said on the pharmaceutical or diet side that appreciate their markets and support the execution of their marketing strategies, which are by the way very complementary to our strategies. It helps grow the market and also a small revenue source for us.","But what we're really \u2013 the larger impact we're seeing right now with this big data is these advanced medical insights. I mean, I just mentioned the seminal work that used 850,000 patient data points that demonstrated that the length between exposure to Lyme Disease or Ehrlichiosis and increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the dog, which of course supports both our 4Dx product line as well as our kidney test to SDMA, which finds kidney disease earlier. This is a phenomenal big data, evidenced-based work that we will published, we're out in the field, but it's only the beginning of what we see are the \u2013 medical insight.","What we're showing here, and we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the work at Analyst Day is how underutilized diagnostics are in advancing care in the pet. And we know the pet owner wants this. I mean, we know pet owners love their pets, we've talked about; we'll talk about that some more. And so, we're really finding that through this evidence-based medicine, how powerful role diagnostic, how powerful role diagnostics played \u2013 plays when it is used to assess and monitor the health status of a patient and yet the utilization is still very, very low in relation to what would be medically justified.","And so, this is our Companion Animal business, and if we can have, even a couple points of impact on the growth of the Companion Animal business that will be lot of value creation for IDEXX shareholders, who come from our big data, well and doesn't preclude us from other ways that we can use the day. I don't think there is any question that we're in the lead in the industry in using big data to provide insight to the industry on how to advance the standard of care.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks. And one more if I could. On instruments, how should we think about your opportunity to place a second Catalyst in the clinics in either North America or beyond \u2013 and has the lion share of placing a second Catalyst \u2013 already taking place?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, we're going to continue to place second Catalyst, when the customers need the throughput and \u2013 and that's \u2013 so that's still part of our standard program, it's is just a \u2013 I think we have some catch-up to do, and it really \u2013 it really, even with the growth, but the second Catalyst is more satisfying the customers need. It doesn't generate it helps their capacity, but doesn't have any meaningful impact on the growth of their recurring revenues that we can deliver this over the short period of time, although it's certainly a good thing to do. So, it plays a role, but it's a minor role.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for the question. And congrats on a great quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And with that, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, thank you \u2013 thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining on in the call. Again, I just want to congratulate the IDEXX team on really what was an exceptional quarter, the number of opportunities that we're finding to serve our customers is truly amazing. And for investors, we look forward to sharing in more detail the opportunities we see for this market going forward at our Analyst Day which will be webcast and Reg FD for all of investors to benefit from.

McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everyone. I appreciate your joining us for our third quarter earnings call.","IDEXX delivered strong revenue and profit gains in Q3, keeping us on track towards our full-year goals. Today, I'll take you through our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full-year 2018. I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2019. Jon will follow with his comments.","In terms of highlights for the third quarter, revenues of $545 million grew 11% on a reported basis, net of a 1% foreign exchange growth headwind. Organic revenue gains of 12% continued at a strong pace, driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues supported by 13.5% growth in the U.S.","Overall organic revenue growth was slightly below our midpoint projections for the quarter, reflecting moderated growth in international reference lab revenues impacted in part by hot weather conditions in Europe. Operating profit of $117 million increased 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued high organic revenue growth and a 140 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins.","EPS was $1.05 per share, an increase of 39% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong operating profit gains and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Reported EPS results also benefited by approximately $0.08 per share from share-based compensation tax benefits that were approximately $0.05 above our expectations for the quarter, reflecting earlier timing of exercises.","In terms of our 2018 outlook, we're updating our full-year revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.215 billion based on an outlook for 11.5% to 12% organic revenue gains and updated estimates for FX impacts. In terms of our outlook, we expect to deliver a full-year organic growth trend \u2013 growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, in line with our year-to-date trend of 13.2%, supported by continued strong growth trends in the U.S. and an expanding international consumable revenues.","We're pulling down the high end of our most recent projected overall organic growth range by 0.5% to reflect expectations for near-term pressures on LPD revenues and tough Q4 comparisons for instrument placements as well as updated expectations for international lab growth, which will constrain the additional CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth acceleration we targeted for the second of this year.","We're refining our 2018 EPS guidance to $4.16 to $4.21, or 33% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currently basis, a $0.04 per share increase at midpoint reflecting $0.01 per share increase for operational performance, supported by our expectations for operating margin gains at the high end of our previous guidance range and $0.03 of upside related to higher projections for share-based compensation tax benefits.","In terms of our 2019 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion, supported by organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11%, and EPS of $4.61 to $4.75 per share resulting in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 15% to 18%, aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our organic revenue growth outlook reflects expectations for a sustained strong CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5%, in line with 2018 trends adjusted for the approximately 1% in non-recurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard change. Our EPS outlook incorporates $0.03 per share in projected headwinds from FX and expectations for $0.10 to $0.13 per share in lower tax benefits from share-based compensation activity in 2019, which we'll review in more detail in my comments.","Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Strong Q3 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $478 million, up 13% organically, reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% in growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement.","Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues also increased 13% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business, reflected in a 29% increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements.","Out Water business revenues grew 9% organically in the third quarter to $33 million, supported by solid growth in the U.S. and double-digit gains in international regions, including very strong growth in Brazil. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q3 was $29 million, up 7% organically. Quarterly growth was aided by favorable comparisons to low prior-year revenues related to health herd (sic) [herd health] screening of export cattle into China. Gains in poultry revenues were offset by end market impacts related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing.","We also continue to see impacts from lower milk prices in key markets, which is constraining dairy testing and bovine pregnancy test sales. Given these factors, we expect flat to modest declines in LPD organic revenues for the full-year 2018 with mid to high single-digit revenue declines projected for the fourth quarter.","By region, U.S. revenues were $341 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by a 13.5% increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth in U.S. reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth was primarily volume-driven with overall net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. Our U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also sustained at very high levels, supported by steadily increasing levels of customers under long-term contracts.","IDEXX's U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace solid overall U.S. veterinary practice market growth, reflected in our data set from about 5,000 clinics. In Q3, patient visits were up 1% and clinic revenues increased 5% compared to the prior-year period.","International revenues in Q3 were $205 million, up 10% organically. International results were supported by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These results continue to be driven by consumable revenue gains of over 20%, reflecting expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and increased utilization and adoption of new tests, including SDMA. We're benefiting from our focus on high economic value placements in international regions, which drove a 36% increase in placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3.","International lab revenue growth moderated to the low to mid-single-digit range in Q3, including slower growth in key European markets, which were impacted by weather conditions which constrained sample volumes sent to our labs in the quarter. Our executional emphasis on driving high competitive Catalyst placement growth in international markets has also shifted some sales executional focus from driving international lab business, which we expect will contribute to mid to high single-digit international lab revenue growth in the near term, which is factored into our refined growth outlook.","In terms of segment performance, our Q3 results benefited from ongoing global expansion of our Catalyst and SediVue instrument base. Globally, we placed 3,026 premium analyzers, up 10%, supported by 20% growth in North America, which benefited from a favorable comparison to relatively moderated placement gains in last year's third quarter as we implemented our 2017 U.S. field sales expansion.","Our focus on high economic placements drove a 26% global increase in global Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts and strong double-digit EVI gains in both North America and international. As expected, our focus on high economic placements shifted some emphasis from chemistry upgrades and hematology instrument placements in the quarter, which constrained overall international premium placement growth to 4% compared to very strong prior-year levels.","Globally, we placed 1,611 Catalysts in total in Q3, a 16% year-on-year increase, and 821 premium hematology instruments globally, down 3% year on year. We achieved 922 Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3, or 57% of total. In North America, we placed 319 Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts, or 75% of total. This represented a 10% year-on-year increase, with 15% gains in the U.S. As noted, international Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts increased 36% year on year in Q3.","We also drove strong continued momentum with SediVue, reflected in 594 global placements or 18% growth, driven by 30% year-on-year growth in North America.","In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,495 SNAP Pros in Q3 globally, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to almost 23,000.","Overall CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q3 were $32 million, up 10% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. This amount is primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S.","Our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation continues to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of $153 million grew 19% organically in Q3. Results reflected continued strong gains in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. High volume-driven consumable gains were supported by expansion of SediVue Pay per Run and SDMA slide revenues, which contributed approximately 4% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $184 million grew 11% organically in the third quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains very strong, reflected in mid-teen volume-driven organic reference lab revenue gains. As noted, overall lab revenue growth was moderated by low to mid-single-digit gains in international markets.","Rapid assay revenues at $54 million grew 6% organically in Q3, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume-driven, reflecting continued growth of 4Dx Plus, specialty, and first-generation products.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 was $117 million, up 17% as reported or 20% on a constant currency basis, with results driven by continued high profit growth in our CAG business. Operating margins were 21.5%, up 110 basis points as reported and 140 basis points on a constant currency basis.","Gross profit of $306 million in Q3 was up 12% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 56% increased approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to prior-year levels, net of approximately 25 basis points of negative impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue.","Gross margin expansion was driven by lower product costs in LPD and VetLab consumables, solid price gains and benefits from high consumable growth. Overall gross margin gains were moderated by investments in lab service capacity and employee benefits, including the increase in our 401(k) match levels as part of the Tax Reform reinvestment, as well as unfavorable impacts related to instrument program mix under the new revenue accounting standard. Foreign exchange hedge gains which benefit gross profit were limited in Q3.","Operating expenses in the quarter increased 8% on a reported and 9% on a constant currency basis, resulting in approximately 100 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales and marketing investment and higher G&A costs in the quarter, offset in part by the lab cost reclass.","We incurred a $2.6 million impairment of work in progress assets related to the SNAP Fecal product in Q3, which was recorded in G&A, which was offset by favorable changes in other accruals. As noted, EPS in Q3 was $1.05 per share, including $7 million or approximately 8% per share in tax benefits related to share-based compensation activity, which as noted was about $0.05 per share above our expectations. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 39%, including benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.","Our effective tax rate was 14.5% in Q3, including approximately 6% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q3 2017 and 2018 decreased operating profit by $3 million and EPS by $0.03 per share.","Year-to-date free cash flow was $182 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of about 70% to 75% of net income for 2018. This reflects a consistent outlook for full-year capital spending of $140 million, including approximately $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation, as well as additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements.","Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $73 million in capital towards the repurchase of 300,000 shares in the quarter. Year-to-date we've repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $207 per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","We ended Q3 with $1.022 billion in debt, $147 million in cash, and $435 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.74 times gross and 1.49 times net of cash.","We continue to maintain a 2018 full-year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We now are projecting annual net interest expense of $34 million to $35 million reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization.","In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full-year reported revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.215 billion, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 11.5% to 12%. This reflects a full-year outlook for CAG Diagnostic organic revenue growth in line with our strong year-to-date trends, which include about 1% of growth benefit related to the implementation of the New Revenue Standard. For the full year, we now expect a 0.5% reported revenue growth benefit from foreign exchange, slightly less favorable than earlier estimates, as the recent strengthening of the dollar offsets first half gains.","Our updated overall organic growth outlook lowers the high end of our prior guidance range of 11.5% to 12.5% by 0.5%. As noted, we're planning for near-term pressure on our LPD business related to end market factors, impact of swine testing in China, and dairy testing globally. We've also factored in expectations for moderated growth in our international lab business, which will constrain the additional acceleration in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth that we had targeted for the second half of 2018.","For the fourth quarter, we expect reported revenue growth in the 7% and 9% range, net of an estimated 2% FX headwind. We expect to sustain high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains in Q4, supported by continued strong U.S. trends. We are projecting a moderation in overall organic growth to the 9% to 11% range related to tough prior year comparisons in global instrument placements and expectations for lower revenues in our LPD business.","In terms of EPS, we're raising our 2018 full-year guidance by $0.04 per share at midpoint to $4.16 to $4.21 and narrowing our projected EPS range to reflect an outlook for 33% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This outlook incorporates expectations for 110 to 130 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement at the higher end of our prior guidance range, which supports approximately $0.01 per share in operational improvement at midpoint. Our EPS guidance assumes $0.01 in full-year benefit related to FX changes, net of hedge impacts, in line with earlier estimates.","Our updated EPS guidance assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of 18% to 18.5%, a 100 to 150 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.03 of EPS upside. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of approximately $21 million or about 5% in full-year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation.","At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.23 per share in full-year benefit. This level of benefit is much higher than we have previously expected for this year and reflects increased realized benefits related to the rapid appreciation of IDEXX's stock price, including earlier timing of exercises.","As we'll discuss in our preliminary guidance for 2019, we anticipate that about 10% to 13% (sic) [$0.10 to $0.13] (00:20:34) per share of the EPS tax benefit we've realized this year will not carry over into 2019. As we look ahead to 2019, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our stated long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion, reflecting expectations for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue gains, supported by 11.5% to 12.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.","Note that our 2019 results will now be fully comparable under the New Revenue Standard, which we estimate will provide about 1% of growth rate benefit to CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in 2018 that will not recur in 2019. Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 8% to 9.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% foreign exchange headwind related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Our preliminary 2019 EPS guidance of $4.61 to $4.75 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points on a constant currency basis, also consistent with our long-term goals. At the rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will decrease revenue growth by about 1.5% and EPS by $0.03 per share, net of established hedge positions which at current rates would result in approximately $10 million of net pre-tax gains.","Our projected 2019 effective tax rate is 20% to 21%. This outlook assumes $9 million to $11 million in share-based compensation tax benefits, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. tax policy. As noted, this is $0.10 to $0.13 per share below the tax benefits we're projecting in 2018.","We're projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases at consistent leverage levels and relatively higher floating interest rate costs which contribute to current projections for net interest expense next year of about $38 million. Adjusting for changes in currency, share-based accounting benefits and discrete tax effects, this 2019 EPS outlook equates to a projected 15% to 18% comparable constant currency growth rate, on track with our long-term goals.","Our preliminary 2019 guidance factors in our most recent understanding of tariff-related effects which we currently estimate would have a relatively limited financial impact on IDEXX. This is an area we'll continue to monitor and update in our business plans as we move forward. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2019 guidance in our year-end conference call.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Brian, very comprehensive as always. Overall IDEXX's organic growth remains strong, driven by our Companion Animal Diagnostic recurring revenue, which increased 13.1% globally in Q3, including 13.5% growth in the U.S. This diagnostic recurring revenue globally constitutes about 75% of IDEXX's overall revenue.","The quality of our instrument placements was strong in the quarter. Globally, we achieved 26% growth in Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts; important because these placements are the primary driver of our organic instrument revenue \u2013 consumable growth, which was 19.1% globally in Q3.","New and competitive Catalysts at 922 units grew 10% in North America and 36% internationally, which is supporting that very strong instrument consumable growth. This reflects our continued focus on the economic value index of different types of instrument placements. EVI is an index of the value to IDEXX of the instrument placement in a particular market that comes from both the instruments and consumables over the many future years.","SediVue placements also continued to track in line with our robust plans, at 594 placements, up 18% year-over-year. As part of the multiyear customer agreements under our U.S.-based IDEXX 360 program, SediVue instrument placements also help expand all IDEXX diagnostic revenues. This builds customer retention and allows our field organization to focus on advancing the standard of care through the appropriate use of diagnostics, including adoption of preventative care blood work.","We continue to drive mid-teens growth in our U.S. reference lab business, which accounts for almost $7 out of every $10 of our global reference lab revenues. Q3 continues to benefit from fecal testing, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter with the growth in this category of lab testing driven entirely by panels that include our proprietary fecal antigen technology and now in 2018 constitute a majority of our fecal revenues. Fecal testing, along with preventative care blood work, is driving strong same-customer sales growth of reference lab services.","European lab growth slowed in Q3, due in part to the heat wave impacting parts of Continental Europe over the summer, which reduced patient sample volumes sent to the reference labs. Also with the introduction of our EVI incentive program to our international commercial organizations this year, while we've seen exceptional instrument placement quality growth year-to-year, as noted, the prioritized focus on instrument placements in our international markets has led to some unforeseen impacts on growth rate of our international reference lab testing services. We are already refining our international execution approach to benefit all of our modalities, including importantly the introduction of our IDEXX 360 program internationally, which has had a highly successful launch in the U.S. at the beginning of this year.","Rapid assay test kits with over 80% of revenue coming from the U.S. had an excellent quarter, particularly in line with the launch of a competitive product with SNAP 4Dx earlier in the year. Peer-reviewed research with head-to-head product performance comparisons published in the quarter demonstrates SNAP 4Dx Plus' significant superior ability to detect tick-borne disease compared to the competitive product.","Customers tell us unsurprisingly that test accuracy is their highest priority. Accuracy in detecting the test is, after all, the whole point of the test. Our commercial team is doing a great job getting the results of these peer-reviewed research to our customers as they make their purchasing decisions.","Overall customer retention trends in the U.S. continue at world-class levels of 97% to 98%. And as customers adopt, use and value our unique innovations, including but not limited to SDMA, including Catalyst SDMA, SediVue, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS, software integrations and the differentiated IDEXX 360 program, and we know our customers value the IDEXX diagnostic professionals who visit their practices. As a result, we see continued solid net price realization in the U.S. diagnostics market in the 2% to 3% range. Customer retention outside the U.S. is even higher at 98% to as high as 99.9%, supporting similar solid net price gains.","We're on track with our field-based expansions. The U.S. 2018 expansion is complete and we have transitioned to the larger number of territories in Q4, thus shrinking the number of customers covered by a veterinary diagnostic consultant. As a result of our 13% expansion in field-based resources, there's always some adjustments when territories are redrawn. Although with the experience of two prior expansions under our belt, we're getting even better at the transition process in the U.S.","Regardless, we have a strong instrument placement compare from Q4 of 2017. And so, while we expect a strong Q4 2018 instrument placement quarter in the U.S., the year-over-year growth of Q4 placements will reflect both the transitional impacts of the U.S. expansion and a tough compare.","Internationally, our plan is to have the expansion completed in early 2019 when we're on track to have over 400 field-based professionals. These global field expansions, the ongoing momentum in the U.S. and the continued high potential for growth we see in international markets gives us confidence in our preliminary outlook of 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth of our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue in 2019, consistent with 2018 trends adjusting for the 1% New Revenue Standard growth benefit in 2018.","I want to recognize the exceptional Companion Animal Group performance in Q3 of our international teams in Germany, Spain, Netherlands, the four Nordic countries, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China, Japan and Southeast Asia. These commercial teams show us how international as a whole can advance the adoption of IDEXX innovations to help pets and vet practices all over the world.","A couple of other notes. Our digital imaging business had an exceptional Q3, building on our Lower the Dose campaign, leveraging our unique digital radiography offering that reduces radiation exposure by veterinary technicians. Q3 and year-to-date performance of digital radiography placements growth rate is in the high-20s percent with Q4 order rate trends also looking very strong as we begin to lap some tougher year-over-year compares.","Our Water business also continues to achieve impressive organic revenue growth of 9% in Q3 due to commercial and innovation investments worldwide. We continue to make steady progress in building our Legiolert franchise in the Water business, which contributed 1% to revenue growth in the quarter.","Our Legiolert product has a long runway of growth opportunity over the next few decades. Water's year-to-date organic growth of 10%, operating margins of 46%, limited investment capital and world-class levels of customer retention above 90% make the Water business and the team truly exceptional.","Overall, our business trends are strong and our revenue performance is on track with our longer-term goals which is reflected in our 2019 guidance. We are proud to have built a business model with enduring and predictable growth and profit dynamics. Perhaps, this is why we are part of a small minority of companies that provides earning guidance in the Q3 call for the next calendar year.","Note that this has been our practice for every year for the last 15. And further, we have an unbroken track record of subsequently delivering within or above that next year's earning guidance range on an adjusted constant currency basis, quite a 15-year record; perhaps unique and a testament to our business model and our team focused on innovation and the customer in delivering financial returns. And I'm deeply proud of them.","So, we'll open it up to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. My first one for you just on the international lab growth, can you speak to a little bit more detail there in regards to your comfort that there's no competitive changes? I know you mentioned the weather, you mentioned some sales force focus on instrument placements which makes sense given the recurring nature of that and the high margin there. But any other color you can have on maybe how much was weather related, how much was the sales force refocus, and then what the retention rates were in regards to clients OUS?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, thank you for the question, Ryan. The retention rates remain exceptional in the international reference lab business as a whole. So, we really don't say that was a factor. I think it's probably a roughly equal parts weather which impacted Continental Europe where we have a lot of reference lab business, of course, out of our German core lab network; and part, the executional focus, obviously, the 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements which drove over 20% growth in the instrument consumable revenue, very profitable revenue for us, was a good aspect of our international performance.","And as we move forward and we're introducing the IDEXX 360 program which just really wraps in all of the modalities, this is something that the international organization has just started to adopt. And I think we'll build a competencies and merit area as we complete the commercial expansion through the end of the year and should bode well for 2019 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue in the international market which we've targeted generally at the 12% to 16% range.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Ryan, just to Jon's point on some of the impact being weather, we've seen an improvement early in Q4 relative to some of the trends we saw in the summer. So, that's clearly was part of the dynamic. But I think the executional shift that they create, it's prudent in the near term for us to have that mid- to high-single-digit growth rate overall in Q4.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, maybe a bit too nuance, Brian, but looks like sales and marketing at about $95 million was actually down on a sequential basis, which doesn't appear to be seasonal looking back over the last few years and somewhat surprising given the sales force investments you're making, so anything nuance there to explain why that actually took a downtick in the third quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Sometimes we can have just the charges or reversal in charges that impact those areas. We're on track for the additions that we had talked about in the U.S. expansion. And I think that's reflected in the year-on-year growth, which was high single digit. And I think that's more indicative of how we're managing it there. There can always be some noise quarter to quarter.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Also, I don't know if it's on an absolute basis, obviously, the dollar strengthened in the third quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That's a good point, Jon. There were some changes in the reported numbers related to FX.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. I'll hop back in the queue.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello, good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, just one broad question. I'm getting this across my overall coverage universe. There's a lot of concern about slowing in the consumer markets and macro concerns going on. Obviously, your 2019 guide doesn't seem to imply that you're worried about the market. But I guess could you just talk about the broader overall landscape on what you're seeing? And I guess what are you looking for in terms of economic indicators and stuff that get you worried? And I have a follow-up.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We have a very strong business in the U.S.; obviously, a very large part of the global IDEXX revenues. We're very effective in creating our own growth. I think in general, our diagnostic recurring revenue has grown 800 basis points higher than nominal personal consumption expenditures. And that's been expanding over the last many years, as we have gotten people to really appreciate the importance of blood work and care.","One thing we talked about, Derik, as you recall in the Investor Day, was preventative care. It's really interesting. There's just a deep well there. We have about \u2013 a little over 2,000 customers who have adopted our Preventative Care Challenge program. These customers are growing their IDEXX diagnostics revenue at 16% on average. That's over 2,000 customers, and yet that's less than 10% of our total customers. So that's driving very strong same-store sales growth. And that's a result of the commercial investments we're making. And so it's these kinds of efforts which I think have allowed us to actually expand the differential between our recurring growth and nominal PCE in the U.S.","And we're seeing \u2013 obviously the economy certainly didn't affect our 36% year-over-year growth in instrument placements across international markets. And you noted the diverse set of countries that I mentioned. And so we're pretty diversified there. So we're not going to say we're completely immune to the economy, but we're very confident.","If you look back along the 15 years, we may have had a recession somewhere in the past, and yet we've delivered on our earnings guidance that we give in the following year, which I've mentioned is a relatively small number of companies actually provides 2019 guidance. And we've delivered every year, including in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each year we gave guidance the October of the year before that year, and we've delivered within or above on constant currency adjusted earnings basis on those, which really shows on that guidance which really shows the enduring predictability of the business model.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, and then just one follow-up. If I heard you correctly, you said that your U.S. sales force expansion was done and that I'm just curious on the international push and how much more you're going to spend incrementally on the international sales force.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So our international is on its way. It's going to build over Q3, Q4, and early into 2019, and so the international group are hard at work on that. And so I saw that the numbers are all factored into our guidance obviously. When you're growing at double-digit rates, even with the issues in the international reference lab growth in Q3 that were weather-related, we grew 12% internationally. So it really gives us confidence.","The opportunity we see internationally, the 36% growth in new\/competitive Catalyst placements as a result of the adoption of EVI, this really gives us confidence to continue to build on what are really some world-class country teams around the world.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just one follow-up just because I've gotten hit by a couple of clients as I'm sitting here talking. It's just like this. I guess people feel like that the 2019 guide is a little bit conservative at this point in time. Obviously, you've got the stock-based compensation headwinds that are factored in. I guess what are some of the puts and takes on the guide for next year? And just walk through it, the estimates are below the consensus estimate. And so I'm just \u2013 I think people are looking for a little bit more color.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So I think, Derik, the key place to start is our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, the 11.5% to 12.5%. That's basically right on our 2018 trend. So if you take the current guide that we have that our full-year number is going to be about in line with our year-to-date growth rate of \u2013 it's 13.2% and adjust for the benefit growth rate \u2013 benefit we're getting from the revenue accounting standard change, which is a little bit above 1%, it's effectively approximately 12%. That's the midpoint for next year. So I think our guide on CAG Dx recurring revenues is right in line with trend.","We did point out that I think our overall organic growth will be up against some tougher compares on just higher levels of instrument placements. We're looking to grow instruments and get benefit from the investments we're making. But we've had an exceptional year and we're going to have a tougher compare there.","And I think LPD, we're appropriately cautious just given some of the end market dynamics. It's a business that's 90% international and more heavily weighted to emerging markets. And I think we're being appropriate in having a more cautious view on growth in that area. But I think the underlying core driver of our economics in our business, the CAG recurring is very much in line with trend and that's supportive of the strong operational \u2013 financial and operational outlook that we're sharing.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And then with regard to the \u2013 in addition to those comments from Brian, with regard to the earnings, I do want to reinforce the point that Brian made in his prepared remarks that we're going to see a step-down in the tax rate benefit \u2013 predict a step-down in tax rate benefit from stock option compensation of 10% to 13%. And that may not have been \u2013 since we've talked about the benefits in 2018 all along, I've been very, very transparent about that. In 2019, we're going to have fewer options exercised. We have fewer options expiry, we had some pull forward into this year. So that's really a non \u2013 that's an accounting change. But when we look at comparable constant currency earnings growth, we get to the 15% to 18%, which is factored in our long-term guide.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks, guys, and good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Brian, I've been jumping between calls, I apologize if you've addressed this. But just want to address \u2013 or I think how we should view margin expansion in 2019? And I guess, where I'm going with this is, is it more shared between gross margin and OpEx leverage relative to what we've seen in 2018?","And then a sort of a follow-up to that, I'm guessing when we think about the quarterly cadence, is the OpEx leverage maybe a little bit bigger in 2H relative to 1H as you lap some of the more recent investments?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a good way to look at it, Jon. I think we're expecting to have gross margin improvement driven by the things that we've been focused on, which is sustaining solid price gains and improving productivity in our operations, including global labs and those in growing areas like our consumable revenues, which have benefits for us and we expect to build on that.","I think that the OpEx leverage, we do have another wave of investment here around the U.S. expansion as well as the international expansions that we've highlighted that we think are very high-return investments. These have been very successful for us as we've accelerated our growth in recent years and just reinforces the opportunity that we see to continue to invest in growing the market.","And I think to your point that will create relatively more of a challenge earlier in the year in terms of compares than in later in the year. We'll share more color on that, obviously, as we finalize our plans and provide the full-year numbers for you on the Q4 call, but I think that's an appropriate way to look at it.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then just...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And then just \u2013 we're always appreciative of your questions, Jon, and recognize the situation you're in. We are very committed to our long-term goals of 50 to 100 basis point operating margin expansion, which we're over-delivering \u2013 expect to over-deliver on in 2018 and expect to continue to deliver on in 2019 and over the long term.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks, Jon. And maybe one or two more if I may. Jon, anything on the competitive update? I mean, are you seeing any changes in the field with the recent acquisition of Abaxis and the deal actually closing, positive or negative for you guys? And any alteration as to pricing the market or changes in the way Zoetis is coming to market overseas? And then, I've got one quick follow-up to that. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I'll tell you we have \u2013 the answer is really no. The one comment you may have missed in the prepared comments is that we published peer-reviewed research, which shows a substantial superiority in our SNAP 4Dx, obviously, an important franchise in detecting tick-borne disease and heartworm. And as I commented, accuracy is the number one criterion for customers in purchasing decisions, after all, that's the whole point of running the test, it's to detect disease.","And we're doing a great job with our close to 500 field-based professionals getting the word out on the differential. And we had a very strong rapid assay quarter in Q3, mostly U.S. business, over 80% in the face of a competitive product launch against the important 4Dx franchise. The year-over-year growth of 26% globally in new and competitive Catalyst placements walk and ride along.","And so really we haven't skipped a beat here in Q3 from a competitive point of view. Our customer retention rates remain very strong and consistent, maybe even slightly improved in the U.S. and very, very high \u2013 even higher internationally. Our price realization continues in 2% to 3% range in the U.S. and good \u2013 similar type of price realization internationally.","We believe that our opportunity here is to create our own growth. And when we can get over 2,000 practices see 16% same-store sales growth in their diagnostics when they start adopting preventative care, I know you did some studies on, that's really less than 10% of our total customers who work with us on preventative care. We get 16% overall diagnostic recurring revenue growth in these customers year-over-year in the last year when they adopted these programs. This is the opportunity that we have.","And, of course, we're unique in being able to do that because our diagnostic line finds more underlying disease and finds it earlier. And so with all the additions of the SDMA, our differentiated hematology, fecal antigen, the quality 4Dx, it actually increases the medical justification and evidence-based medicine to run preventative care, blood work on pets of all ages. And that story is resonating and has a very, very long-term runway and is a unique opportunity for IDEXX to do. So, really no changes in the competitive environment to answer your question.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. I'll actually take my last one offline. Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. You discussed the international lab business some, but I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape, growth was pretty strong in the U.S. in particular. Any major changes there or what are you kind of hearing in the field? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. No real changes in the U.S., a very strong performance continuing to edge every quarter a little bit higher, customer retention in the U.S. I think this is the continued adoption of unique value \u2013 the innovations that I had experienced, so the reference lab services, SDMA, molecular diagnostics, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS and, of course, 500 diagnostic subject matter experts that are calling on practices across the U.S. every day.","And so customers value our professionals coming in and helping them on how to advance their standards. And so it's a very strong \u2013 the U.S. reference lab business is a very, very strong component of our overall diagnostic offering in the U.S. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, U.S. generates almost $7 out of every $10 of global reference lab business, so an important element of the equation.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, just to reinforce, it was some of the metrics we shared, Erin, we had 15% growth in Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts. We had accelerated growth in consumable revenues, continued mid-teen growth in reference labs, solid continued volume growth in rapid assay, net price gains in the 2% to 3% range, the 13.5% overall. The U.S. is really continuing to execute well, record levels of retention, record levels of customers under contract that steadily increases. So, I think we're feeling great about the U.S. business and...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I don't want to say it's not competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I just don't see any change in that competitive \u2013 we're competing with innovation and growth. And that's resonating with our customers. In addition, we have more and more of our customers who have elected to partner with IDEXX with our IDEXX 360 program, which is a very friendly way to add capital and combine with a multiyear commitment to IDEXX and so...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And so we had 30% growth in SediVue year-over-year in North America.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. So, SediVue \u2013 many times when we placed SediVue with an IDEXX 360, we get the entire diagnostic revenue of that customer under a five, six-year agreement.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great, thanks. And then one last one, just drilling into rapid assay in particular here, any changes or surprises relative to your thinking on the competitive positioning on 4Dx Plus? And how is the success in bundling in SNAP Pro? Are you seeing that improve overall kind of retention rates for what may be an inherently more vulnerable segment? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for that question. We publish peer-reviewed research on the superior accuracy of 4Dx and, of course, that's very important to customers. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. But I do want to add a little bit more color on SNAP Pro. We had a very strong quarter for SNAP Pro placements, up 10% year-over-year in the U.S. And customers who've adopted SNAP Pro into their workflow are more loyal and grow their rapid assay test utilization faster than those that haven't. That's why we had a very solid, I think, rapid assay quarter in Q3.","As of Q3, Erin, customers who are active and connected with SNAP Pro, meaning they're integrated with IDEXX and SmartService and everything and they're using SNAP Pro, they constitute 57% of our SNAP 4Dx revenues in the U.S. This is a growing percentage over time as we continue to place instruments. And thus, we're well on our way to turning the SNAP 4Dx Plus market into an instrument-based razor-razorblade business model.","And, Erin, I think you know because SNAP Pro leverages IDEXX's unique integration of the instrument through IDEXX VetLab Station with the overall software of the practice, the practice information management system, you get big staff productivity and economic benefits from charge capture from this integration. Still totally unique to IDEXX after 10 years, and SNAP Pro builds upon our overall VetLab integration ecosystem, increasing the loyalty for not just rapid assay, but the overall diagnostic offerings. That strategy just continues to march along. And we're \u2013 I think that's \u2013 there're a lot of reasons why we had a solid rapid assay quarter in Q3 in the face of competitive launch accuracy and also the evolution of the customer base with SNAP Pro.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thank you for taking my question. So, the other one kind of on the European reference lab dynamic, you mentioned that you're talking to customers about getting them onto a little bit more of an EVI focus and that would imply that you will have revenue kind of catch up as these customers migrate to, say, maybe more instrument. So, just for the sake of our models, can you kind of just talk about how this might play out over the next few quarters and just to reconcile what reference lab is going to do versus what instruments they're going do in Europe?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So, I think we feel very good with the instrument placement momentum in Europe. Certainly, Q3 was a strong quarter with a 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements outside the U.S., which of course was the EVI focus. And what we're going to be doing going into 2019 is starting to roll out the IDEXX 360 program internationally which really wraps in growing the reference lab business as well as the in-house business in a multiyear partnership along with instrument placements. We think this will help us continue with strong instrument placements and, of course, consumable growth and also help us build reference lab growth. So...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Dave, I think it's important to understand, EVI as a metric is very helpful for our sales teams in thinking about when they're placing or trying to place instruments, what type of placements drive the most value. It's not intended to be something that shifts attention from growing the customer relationship and that is reflected in how we approach compensation where we have \u2013 the majority of our compensation is oriented towards overall recurring growth.","I think what \u2013 so I don't think the EVI metric should drive an issue in terms of reference lab growth. I think what we're acknowledging is that we've got a huge opportunity for instrument placements internationally in Catalyst and that's been our focus. And we've had somewhat of a shift from the sales execution towards that and that is something that we are anticipating we can \u2013 we move back in balance over time. And so don't see the near-term kind of dynamics as being something to be concerned about for the long term. But I think, just to be clear, EVI is I think not something that should negatively impact our growth in reference labs.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Even in the near term. Okay, thank you very much. And then maybe just to go a little bit further on the European area, would there be any different kind of customer dynamics with the fact that there is fairly deconsolidation in Northern Europe? And maybe offer what some of the challenges are there and maybe what some of the opportunities there are.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So with the corporatization or consolidation that's taking place in Northern Europe, we are in excellent shape with most of the consolidators except for one who happens to have a competitive reference lab. And so we think we're in very good shape, and many of these are very interested in our opportunity to help them grow same-store sales. Because what's happening is while, on one hand, they can grow through acquisitions, they'd also like to grow four-wall revenue, which has very nice drop-through, particularly with diagnostics. And they're appreciative of the fact that we can bring resources to bear at the current level through our commercial organizations and, of course, unique innovation to help drive growth.","We also have a fabulous software offering. We have the leading cloud-based software in Europe, Animana. But the Smart Flow acquisition, which we're really excited about, we closed in early Q3, is a global platform. And we have a strong base of customers in Europe, U.S. and Australia. It's actually \u2013 and it adds value to really all customers with different practice information management systems because it's workflow software. And then when we integrate it with the PIMS, which we're already well on our way of doing with Neo, Cornerstone, and Animana, it brings even more unique value to these customers.","And so this is something I think will help us both in Europe and the U.S. with these corporate customers that are looking for a partner who can bring a sophisticated enterprise software approach. And there really isn't anyone else with the competencies and product ecosystem, software ecosystem, including cloud-based software ecosystem that can partner with our customers. And so I think this will benefit us on both the software side as well as the diagnostics side.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","And I realize we're low on time, so you can just answer this yes or no. Does the 2019 guidance factor any sort of maybe late product launch?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It factors all of our plans in place. And so generally speaking, if you look at IDEXX growth in any particular year, most product launches have not really been a major component. It's really the core growth, the adoption of products we've launched over the last five to seven years. And so we're not making any product launch announcements at this point in time, but it factors in all of our plans for 2019.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey guys. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, we're still here.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","You had some hot weather in Europe in Q3. As we think about Q4 and into the first half of 2019, can you just speak to reference lab growth? Brian, I think you might have made comments about potentially mid to high single-digit growth in the near term from international reference labs.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That's right.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Historically, you've been in the 13% to 14% growth rate in reference labs. So I guess excluding weather, is there any reason to think that that level of growth might decelerate?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","You're talking about \u2013 that would be global growth that you were referring to, the 13% to 14%?","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Correct. Correct.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think there is nothing to say that we can't get back to those levels. We're certainly growing better than that in the U.S. and have been, and I think we've got great...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And U.S. is $7 out of every $10 of global reference lab volume, so an important contributor to the whole.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So to your question, this is more of a near-term impact. We haven't gotten that granular heading into 2019, Mark, but I think there is an aspect of this that we've shifted some executional focus. So this will kind of...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's interesting. The weather thing, there are really two facts going on. One is obviously lower foot traffic, but the other thing is customers get concerned about sending samples to the lab when it's really hot out. They're worried they're going to get spoiled along the way. And so those are the two factors which can \u2013 and it was very clear that the six weeks or so in summer during that heat wave, that impacted our revenue. It wasn't the only slowdown, but it was...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Mark, I'd just reinforce, our 2019 guidance basically for overall CAG recurring growth is right in line with our year-to-date trends, adjusted for foreign exchange.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Right. Adjusted for the 1%, 11.5% to 12.5%. So we're really seeing the fundamentals of the business continue in 2019 that we see year-to-date and through the balance of 2018 for total CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues which, as you know, is 75% of the total IDEXX revenues.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Terrific. And then, practice revenue of 5% was strong in the quarter. Historically, you've been somewhere in the 4% to 7% range. In terms of end user demand, do you see any changes there?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's remained very solid, as you pointed out, in a similar range of growth. And of course, that's the overall growth in the vet clinics and we believe...","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Our customers are growing faster.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Our customers grow faster, diagnostics grow faster, and we influence that growth. So I think we feel good about the market trends, particularly in the U.S.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, and just one last quick one, I think you indicated at your Analyst Day that you intend to launch a new slide onto Catalyst sometime in 2019. Is that still your intention? And can you provide any color around what that might look like?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think just to review the history in 2018, we launched the Catalyst SDMA slide, and that has had great success. It's adopted by almost 50% of our global Catalyst base. We launched the SDMA T4 combo kit in the June-July timeframe. We launched the CRP slide, which has been a great success outside the U.S. The U.S. doesn't fully appreciate the value of CRP. They will in time. And we will continue to expand the menu. And we also expanded the menu on ProCyte with retic hemoglobin, another parameter. So, this is really a steady diet of menu expansion. We're not talking about any specific further expansions at this time. But they're in the pipeline, of course.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Expect ongoing innovation.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I just want to thank everybody and appreciate your attention during a very busy day. And also, I want to thank all the employees. We just continue to have a great performance in terms of bringing advanced care to veterinarians, pet owners and pets alike, it's what drives us, it's what our purpose is.","And we look forward to finishing the year and again we are really proud to be able to provide 2019 guidance, which is something that not too many companies do. And we're even more proud that we've done this for the last 15 years. And then, we've \u2013 in terms of the earnings guidance and we've delivered against that earnings guidance within or above the range on an adjusted constant currency basis in the subsequent year that we provided guidance for. So, it really is a testament to the team and the predictability and enduring growth characteristics of this business, driven by a very high degree of recurring revenue.","So, with that, we'll close the call.

I'm going to turn the call over to Will now to take you through the numbers and I'll come back with some color commentary.","Willard R. Blanche","Thank you, Jon. Good morning, and thank for joining us for today's call. As reported in our press release, our third quarter revenues were $338.3 million, yielding organic growth of 7.4% versus 2012 and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.86, an increase of 13% versus the prior year period. Third quarter organic revenue growth was driven by a strong underlying performance across the annuity portions of our Companion Animal Group business, including lab services, Rapid Assays and instrument consumables, partially offset by reductions in revenue from interim placements. Earnings per share growth exceeded revenue growth due to an 80-basis-point expansion in gross margins, continued reductions in shares outstanding and a reduction in the tax rate. Currency had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS versus Q3 last year, slightly favorable to our expectations.","As a typical, we'll start with observations on the economy government and share what we see in the U.S. veterinary market based on data from approximately 700 of our Cornerstone customers. We are encouraged that during the quarter, patient visits were up 2.6% and practice revenues grew 6.1% versus the prior year. This is favorable to the numbers we reported in Q2 when we saw patient visits grow 0.7% and practice revenues grow 4.9%. Our guidance continues to reflect the cautious outlook on the impact, the economy may have on our growth rates given uncertainty, both domestically and abroad. In this regard, even with a relatively strong Q3 statistics, total year-to-date growth metrics were 1.1% per patient visits, and 4.7% for practice revenues versus the prior year.","VetLab instruments and consumable revenue of $108 million grew 8% organically versus Q3 2012. Instrument revenue of $19.1 million declined 10% organically. Analyzers placed through volume commitment reagent rental or other deferred revenue programs in Q3 of this year, negatively impacted our year-over-year instrument revenue growth by roughly 2%. Both chemistry and hematology placement declined versus Q3 last year and were different than our expectations for the quarter due to shortfalls in the U.S. However, the quality of our placement continues to be high and we are very encouraged by the positive dynamics we are seeing with our diagnostic sales force, which Jon will elaborate on in more detail. Our worldwide chemistry placement declined 5% year-over-year due to the decrease in Catalyst placement in the U.S. As I just mentioned, the quality of our placement remains very strong with 57% of our North American Catalyst placements and 49% of our worldwide Catalyst placements going to customers new to IDEXX. For the full year 2013, we expect chemistry placements to decline in the low-single digits versus our prior guidance of low-single digit growth compared to the prior year.","Our worldwide hematology placements declined 10% versus Q3 last year. Similar to Catalyst, we continue to a high percentage of ProCyte placements going to customers new to IDEXX, 45%, in fact, for Q3. For the full year 2013, we expect hematology placements to decline in the mid-single digits versus our prior guidance of flat year-over-year growth.","Instrument Consumables revenues of $75.8 million grew organically 13% versus the prior year period, or 15% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, which negatively impacted revenue growth by almost 5% and certain timing items that favorably impacted revenue growth by over 2%. This strong normalized growth, which is slightly above Q2 performance, is a result of a number of factors including: The quality of our placements; our increasing installed base; increased testing, as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-house labs with Catalyst and ProCyte; and enhanced loyalty from our base of Catalyst customers who now account for 87% of our U.S. chemistry consumable revenues, exclusive of corporate accounts. With these continued strong fundamentals volume growth drivers, we are increasing the low-end of our guidance range and now project our full year 2013 Consumables growth to be 13% to 14% versus prior year.","Our third quarter Rapid Assay sales of $43 million, grew 10% organically versus the prior year, or 5% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, which favorably impacted growth by over 1% and certain timing items that benefited growth by another 4%. We continue to expect normalized growth to be 4% to 5% for the full year 2013 for Rapid Assay.","U.S. distributor inventories for instrument consumables and Rapid Assays averaged a little under 4 weeks at the end of the third quarter based on forward-looking demand, which is within their normal and customary range.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services business, with revenues of $110.3 million in the quarter, grew organically 9% versus the prior year. All geographies contributed to our solid third quarter performance and we benefited from acquisition of new accounts, improved customer retention and incremental testing from our customer base in part due to deleveraging the North American and diagnostic sales force model and VetConnect PLUS. We continue to expect organic revenue growth for labs and consulting services in the 8% to 9% range for full year 2013.","Our Practice Management and Digital Imaging Systems business, with revenues of $22.6 million, grew organically by 9% in the third quarter versus the prior year period, compared to a modest decline for the first half of the year. As mentioned last quarter, we had several new sales reps toward the end of last year and earlier this year. We did see improved placements in Q3 as compared to Q2 but Digital Imaging Systems placements were not quite to the level we'd assumed at the time of last quarter's call. And because of this, we are now expecting full year growth in the mid-single digits versus our prior high-single digit expectation.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 2% organically to $25.1 million in the third quarter, in line with our expectations. The decline was driven by reduced testing in government programs in Europe, including BSE and in Latin America. We expect that Livestock, Poultry and Dairy organic growth for the full year will decline in the low-single digits, consistent with our prior guidance. Madasa, a distributor in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that we acquired on August 20, contributed just under $1 million of revenue in the quarter.","Our water business grew 5% organically versus the prior year period to $23.2 million in the third quarter, in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily due to continued gains in our core Colilert testing business in North America. We are maintaining our previous guidance of mid-single digit organic growth for the full year.","Moving to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin at 55%, as I mentioned, was 80 points favorable to the prior year, primarily due to price realization, favorable revenue mix, including high relative sales of instrument consumables, and continued service efficiencies in our reference labs line of business.","Operating expenses were 35.6% of revenue, and our effective tax rate at 29.1% was somewhat favorable to our expectations due to the release of reserves in conjunction with the completion of tax audits.","Turning to cash flow. Our free cash flow was $64.4 million or 141% of net income in Q3. The improvement compared to the first half of this year is primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the seasonal working capital improvements.","We repurchased 801,000 shares during the quarter, slightly higher than our thinking, when we provided guidance last quarter. Looking forward, we project full year 2013 revenues of approximately $1.370 billion to $1.372 billion, which implies a fourth quarter organic revenue growth rate in the range of 8.0% to 8.4%. This year's second half expected organic growth rate of approximately 8%, which is nearly double our first half organic growth of 4.4%. This second half 8% organic growth is different than the 10% growth expected at the time of our July call, and is driven primarily by anticipated revenue from capital placements, both VetLab and digital systems. These capital placement revenue expectations for the second half are lower for two primary reasons: the lower number of placements, as discussed previously; and higher amounts of deferred revenues as a result of marketing programs.","We expect full year 2013 gross margins to be about 55%, in line with our previous guidance. We expect operating expenses to be approximately 35% of revenue for the year, consistent with our previous guidance as well. 2013 operating margin is projected to be about 19.5% for the full year, which represents a year-to-year expansion of about 25 basis points when normalized for currency, and discrete items, consisting of the $3 million pharma milestone payment in 2012, and the $4 million Trendset loss reserve reported in the first quarter of this year. We expect the tax rate to be 29.0% to 29.5% for the 2013 full year, a half point reduction from our previous guidance, primarily due to the reserve adjustments made in Q3. Net interest expense is expected to be $3.5 million, up from our previous guidance of $2.5 million to $3 million due to higher volumes from our share repurchase activity. Weighted average share count, which is expected to be down 4% from full-year 2012 levels, an increase of 50 to 100 basis points from our previous range of 3.0% to 3.5%, reflecting our latest thinking on share repurchase.","Integration expenses, associated with the Madasa acquisition, negatively impacts EPS by approximately $0.01. This leads to updated full year 2013 earnings per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.48, which compares to our July guidance of $3.42 to $3.48. We expect free cash flow of 95% to 100% of net income and capital investments at $90 million, both consistent with our prior guidance.","As we look forward to 2014, we project revenues of $1.48 billion to $1.50 billion, a year-to-year increase of 8% to 9% in reported growth, and 7% to 8% in organic growth. Modest favorability from acquisitions and currency contributed approximately 1% to 2014 revenue growth. Fully diluted earnings per share are projected to be $3.76 to $3.86, a year-to-year increase of 8% to 11%, or 11% to 14% when normalized with 3 items: first, while currency is anticipated to have a minor favorable impact on revenue growth, our earnings per share guidance contemplates roughly $0.02 of headwind from currency due to 2013 foreign exchange hedge gains that are not projected to recur in 2014 based on 2014 hedges in place and FX rates assumed in our guidance. Second, the Trendset loss reserve reported in 2013 was $0.05; and last, the 2012 and 2013 R&D tax credits benefited 2013 by $0.10 and have not been assumed in our 2014 projections. We're still in the midst of our annual internal planning process and so we will provide more details on the components of our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow at the time of our earnings call in January.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay, nice work to Will. It was nice to see the revenue growth continuing to pick up in Q3. And as Will mentioned, our 7.4% organic revenue growth was driven by 8.7% Companion Animal Group growth, and Companion Animal Group growth is over 80% of our total revenue. That 7.4%, third quarter organic revenue growth was a nice pick up from the prior 2 quarters of 3.3% and 5.5%, Q1 and Q2 for IDEXX as a whole, and the 8.7% was a nice pick up for our Companion Animal Group from 3.6% and 6.8% in Q1 and Q2 of 2013, respectively. So this growth is reflective of the underlying strength we see in the business and it gives us confidence to guide the 7% to 8% organic revenue growth in 2014. Now Q3 was a very important quarter as it was the first full quarter of our CAG diagnostic sales organization in North America. An organization that is responsible for approximately 50% of IDEXX's revenues globally. I'm very pleased with the progress on the team's accomplishments, especially given the magnitude of the change. To remind investors, in April, an initial 20% of our North American sales organization for diagnostics moved to new roles and territories associated with our new customer coverage model. We called this first group, Wave 1. The new coverage model entails a single sales professional serving the customer for all IDEXX diagnostic modalities, including the instruments, SNAP and reference labs. Allowing for smaller more manageably size territories for each rep and more frequent and consistent customer contact. The remaining 80% of the field and what we call Wave 2 assumed their new roles in the new model in Q3. So this past quarter, clearly, has the highest risk for the 80% of North America in Wave 2 with all the associated changes in roles, in territories, in reporting relationships inherent in such a major shift in field sales strategy. The Wave 1 regions that were in their second quarter of the new model during this past quarter 2013 moved down the learning curve and performed better than both their first quarter this year and Q3 last year. Performance as IDEXX looks at it includes achieving goals across all 3 diagnostic modalities: Reference labs, Rapid Assays and instruments and consumables.","On the performance dimension of instrument placements, we were impressed to see Wave 1 region step up, with instrument placement growth year-over-year that reflects the productivity that comes from more time and position in territory and the additional number of reps in the field. As we extrapolate to Q4 and beyond, we anticipate that the second quarter in position learning curve benefits we saw for the Wave 1 regions will improve to the far larger number of Wave 2 regions.","A couple of other notes from our experience. Sales professional turnover remains at historically low levels, below even below Q2 level, we experienced. So in turn, tenure, and time and territories building in the field. We completed the quarter with 40% more customer calls per rep than the old model, which speaks to the benefit of the new coverage account model with smaller geographic territory, and that's far greater reach and frequency. We have 13% more sales professionals in the field in Q3, versus that the same quarter prior year and when you combine that with the 40%, more calls we actually achieved 58% total more customer calls in Q3 than prior quarters. And we enter Q4 with 16% more diagnostic sales professionals in the field than we had in Q4 of 2012. We saw increased loyalty, e.g. fewer loss accounts in Q3 in all 3 diagnostic modalities that at any time in the last couple of years for this important growth metric. Now high customer account loyalty is certainly an outcome of our new customer call -- customer-centric sales model, but also reflects our highly valued and differentiated diagnostic line including VetConnect PLUS, advanced and unique menus and the integration with practice management software, just to name a few.","Another point, Canada, which was part of Wave 2 performed above expectations in Q3, had strong year-over-year instrument placement metrics and executed a very successful launch of VetConnect PLUS in July. And finally, in other international markets, we had almost 10% growth in Europe, and 14% growth in Companion Animal Group, and 14% growth for the Companion Animal Group in Asia-Pacific. And chemistry placements grew year-over-year in both Europe and Asia-Pacific. So in summary, our Companion Animal business showed strong fundamentals with growth normalized -- with global normalized growth in the profitable annuity or recurring revenue aspects of our business. We've mentioned this 15% for instrument consumables, 9% for reference labs and 5% for Rapid Assay. In instrument revenues, while Q3 short falls have caused us to reduce our full year 2013 instrument revenue guidance, the quality of instrument placements continued to be as strong as measured by the percent that are going to new or competitive accounts. We are confident based on Wave 1 progress in Q3, that our North America sales professional productivity and diagnostics will continue to increase, and that assumption, along with the 16% larger sales presence in North America in Q4 over last year, is factored into our 2013 guidance, and of course, the foundation of our 2014 guidance.","We continue to innovate in the new product area. In Q4, we have launched a new catalyst single slide, single test for fructosamine which is a very exciting addition to our chemistry menu, allowing for the diagnosis and management of diabetes in a real-time care model. And diabetes is as important as a disease category, and dogs and cats as it is in humans. This new slide has been developed and has manufactured by IDEXX in our main facility and gives us demonstrated capability to further expand the catalyst slide menu with our internal R&D and manufacturing. While we don't expect the fructosamine in test revenues and itself to be significant, fructosamine is frequently used and highly valued by customers because they see a lot of diabetic patients. And thus, further differentiates our catalyst chemistry instrument from other chemistry platforms in its menu breadth and flexibility and thus, enhances all of the factors that drive our instrument consumable growth. Additionally, we introduced several new innovative products and reference labs, including an allergy screening test and our immunotherapy offering that complements our existing allergy product portfolio. We also introduced it in reference labs, a new canine and feline cardiac tests that significantly improves the customer workflow when assessing cardiac health. So in regards to our portfolio for test of cardiac disease, we recall that we will also be launching a new rapid test in early 2004, the SNAP Feline proBNP, a screening test for heart disease. Thus, the improved reference lab test that we just announced in this past quarter and the new point of care test significantly advances our cardiac testing franchise, leveraging the same proprietary biomarker technology across multiple complimentary modalities.","In fact, this management and digital imaging systems since our last call, we launched IDEXX IMAGEBANK, cloud-based image archive service. We also launched Pet Health Network 3D, a new subscription-based 3D animation product that supports veterinarians in communicating the value of their services to their patients -- to their pet owners and helps explain some of the conditions of the pet. It also -- Pet Health network 3D complements our Pet Health network Pro software-as-a-service offering.","Finally, we continued improve upon Pet Health Network Pro through new releases with key additional functionality for this cloud-based software service. We expect to start shippings SNAP Pro in Q1, as mentioned in the last call, and are taking orders this quarter. SNAP Pro is a mobile device that simplifies workflow associated with the Rapid Assay line, while pushing results to the cloud with VetConnect PLUS. Customer and distributor response has been extraordinarily strong. Our forecasted R&D investment in 2013 is about $88 million and we will build upon this base in 2014. While we don't want to be specific as to what else is in the pipeline, I do want to investors to know that our pipeline includes new instruments, test menu across all 3 modalities and advances in our Information Technology offerings, with many anticipated announcements in 2014. In August, we are very pleased to have acquired Madasa, as Will mentioned, in Brazil. Madasa is a long-time distributor of IDEXX's. This is very strong in entrepreneurial organization will help to serve to accelerate the adoption of our IDEXX Livestock, Poultry, Dairy and Companion Animal lines in this important growing Brazilian market for animal health.","Finally, as we announced last week, I'm absolutely delighted with the prospect of Brian McKeon joining our management team at the beginning of 2014 as our new EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We know Brian well from his decade of service as an IDEXX board member. He brings that tremendous track record and experience base to IDEXX, and thus, will become a key leader in helping to achieve our targets for growth, profitability and shareholder returns in the years to come.","And so, with those introductory remarks, I'd like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, can you speak to the Catalyst placement declines in the U.S. and how much of that do you think is associated with the sales force changes and the dynamics, I guess, behind the placement trends? And how we should think about that going into 2014?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Clearly, that was the sole reason for the decline in catalyst placements with U.S. and narrowing it more specifically, it was the Wave 2 regions, Canada actually did very well, we wanted well and internationally, we did well. But having said that, the quality of the placements was very strong as we've mentioned, in fact, if you just take the 3 quarters so far in 2013, we had almost a 20% increase in the number of competitive placements on an absolute basis. And competitive placements are new to IDEXX's, generating -- obviously, 100% new consumable growth. And I think, it's one of the underlying dynamics, along with strong loyalty of our customer base and the reason why we had the 15% adjusted for inventory factors and distributor inventory changes and other factors, 15% of consumable growth for our instrument line, globally.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one on sales force transformation, how should we think about the incremental costs associated with the initiative is it running better than plan? And how should we think about that going into 2014? And you mentioned better loyalty or retention rates. Where did the retention rate stands now for the reference lab? And VetLab, where do you see that going over the next 12 months?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. So the -- obviously, the cost of the 16% larger sales forces embedded in our operating expense metrics, we did have some one-time cost associated with the transformation that occurred over the first 3 quarters that we will not be recurring. We're basically through that now, and we are well into the model but, of course, the vast majority of our costs associated with providing a good economic experience for our reps, which is what allows them to build tenure and experience in the field, and I think a market-leading technology company.","Willard R. Blanche","Just quickly on that point, though, what I would add is that even though there was a one-time cost in the first part of the year, we have expanded our sales force. And so, we continue -- we've continued to expect that we will not have leverage on the operating...","Jonathan W. Ayers","Right. In general. There's different mixes, so the one-time costs are very small in relation to, of course, the expansion in the sales force. With regard to loyalty, it's very important metric. We're under -- we're over 98% year-over-year loyalty in the instrument consumables lines. I believe we are over 95% in the Rapid Assay line, loyalty and just under 95% in the reference lab line. And all those have been improving metrics over the course of the last, actually over the past 24 months. And we expect them to continue to improve because there's -- once people, I think, are using a highly differentiated line, they appreciate the value of the integrated and they're providing value to their clients and that's one of the benefits of working with IDEXX as a diagnostic partner.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to do a quick follow-up on the sales force transformation. Jon, good data point that the initial waves saw a 20% increase in instrument placements. I wonder if you could go a little bit deeper and talk about how effective they were in other areas, meaning, was the instrument placements more of a focus for that group, or is that a benefit that accrued to the company, while other areas also outperformed?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. It's a great question. In Wave 1 and Wave 2 they're really wasn't much of a learning curve. I mean, they did very well. For example, the sales force had several different performance metrics of which instrument placements is an important one, but by no means they are only one. We have reference lab and Rapid Assay and of course, those loyalty metrics are feed into all of at. And as a whole, the Wave 1 exceeded their performance and the Wave 2 essentially met the goals that we gave them. So obviously, there was some outperformance in some areas that made up for underperformance in other areas.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful color. And then, one thing you didn't mention, I was hoping we could get one, a little bit of an update there on the number of practices that's had? And then number two, I know a lot of things going on with the transformation and the rollout of VetConnect PLUS. I'm curious if you've been able to parse out what kind of favorable impact that specifically has had on loyalty, utilization, cross-selling, any metrics you can offer?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes, in terms of the number of activations, we're a little over 10,000, 10,200 in North America. And of course, we launched it in Canada in July. And Canada had really a very successful launch. We have a very, very strong reference lab business in Canada and I think that team just looked at the U.S. experience and with them, the learning curve as they watch the U.S. experience and think at a much faster launch than we did in the U.S. And we have -- we anticipate towards the end of the year to launch that in one international market and then over the course of 2014, and other international markets, so it will be a global rollout. That the next challenge for us with VetConnect PLUS is utilization. One thing is to activate it and have it available and the next thing is to use it. While the large majority -- the majority of customers who are activated are using one of the things that our new customers centric sales model does, it helps with customers with the change management of moving from sample-centric, getting the result from 1 sample on a piece of paper to a patient-centric looking at the result in the context of the diagnostic history that you have in VetConnect PLUS. So the behavior changes, as we all know, in the veterinary world, it happens not as fast as you would like, but if once it happens, they never go back. And so we have a cadre of customers, of several thousand customers who are very active users of VetConnect PLUS, and that's growing. We measure that now every month. And one of the key roles of the sales organization. It is hard to parse out why is the loyalty growing as a result of VetConnect PLUS versus the sales model versus our more expanded set of test menu, much many of our proprietary test are unavailable other than through IDEXX or strong customer service model that we have. We think they're all contributing factors and the loyalty is really a key component of our strategy going forward.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Hey, Jon, I think the business model continues to sort of be two different worlds. I mean, the recurring is performing well, the equipment, you could argue poorly. If you can just help me, I'm wondering what changed in the last 2 months of the quarter. And by that, I mean, in the last call, I asked a pretty detailed questions. Just after 2 negative revisions to the top line if you felt guidance was where it needed to be. And now even after -- I think it was largely inline quarter, the implied 4Q number sort of moves from up, call it a 11% and maybe up 8 and change. So can you help us with what changed, I know you might reference the sales, what went on in the last maybe 8 weeks that's leading to the revision to 4Q?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay. Thank you. That's a great question. It is -- there are 2 -- you can count -- put our diagnostics business, which I mentioned as you know, about 82%, 83% of the company into 2 categories. You have 92% of that business or 93% of that business is what we call recurring revenues or annuity. That's really all of the diagnostic recurring revenue and then the recurring revenue in the Practice Management and Digital Systems business associated with customer support, the broken -- and Pet Health Network Pro which is description-based targets, all recurring revenue, right? So, 93% of the Companion Animal business. If you look at the recurring revenue growth over the last 3 quarters, Jon, and I'm just giving you kind of approximate numbers from 7.5%, this is for CAG, 7.5% in the first quarter to 9.5% in the second quarter, to nearly 11% in the third quarter. Now the instrument placements are negative. Part of that is marketing programs and part of that is the volume of placements. But what's happening is we're placing in good accounts and that's helping contribute -- the volume may be down but the quality of those placements is good, and that's helping to continue. But I think we would all would say nearly 11% recurring revenue of growth, being 93% of the Companion Animal business. That's a good result. And so -- we're -- and that's the ultimate objective how we measure ourself. Because that revenues is, of course, the more profitable revenue. I'll turn it over to Will in terms of some of the dynamics that have changed from our prior thinking.","Willard R. Blanche","Thanks, Jon. I think really important dynamics here and I think what's really driving some of that strong annuity growth is -- I go back to the quality of the instrument placements and so, while what is causing the decline in revenues in Q2 versus just a 8 weeks ago, is really the number of placements. The quality of those placements as really made up for it. I think we've mentioned on past calls that a competitive placement for us produces approximately 5x the value of a upgrade of one of our own customers. And the competitive placement do take a little bit more time and so we think that, that really has resulted in lower instrument revenues, but producing higher consumable revenues. And so it really is an instrument story. That lab instrument. And then I mentioned also digital placements. We did have some new reps. Our expectation was that they would come up the curve a little bit quicker than they have. But they've made really solid continuing improvements, which gives us more comfort with Q4, but not to the extent that we've had before. So those are really the 2 primary factors, Jon.","Jonathan W. Ayers","And then the other area that I would mention, would be the BioResearch business, which is a strong double-digit grower. But isn't achieving a very high growth rate that we had in our assumption. So that came down a little bit. And then finally, as Will mentioned in his up front comments, there is an increase in deferred revenues associated with capital placements that would apply to both, the digital, as well as -- actually all capital placement, digital instruments and Cornerstone placements, which is associated with our marketing programs and is a result of how those marketing programs are accounted for.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe, this might be part b in the question and you can just give it a simple yes, or no. So your new 2013 guidance sort of implies low 6% organic, by our calculations. And you could argue that 2013 benefited from the new rate with NWI and also the direct change in Nordic countries. So can you just talk to, what gives you the confidence to sort of layout the 7% to 8% organic next year? Is that just a function of everything that you just talked, your 3-year equipment comps? Where you are placing equipment is going into competitive accounts and therefore, you should see a modest reacceleration in '14 versus '13?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. If that's a yes or no question, that's a yes. On the 7% to 8% organic growth for 2014, I think you've laid it out well. You did mention our Nordic go direct, that is really a very, very successful. We've had almost triple-digit growth in Nordics in Q3. And we've just been a very -- it's not a big number, so it's one of the contributing factors to the nearly 10% Europe CAG growth, 9.5% or so. But it's a -- it's been a very, very successful strategy for us. And now, we've essentially, in a little bit different way. We've done that in Brazil, acquired a very, very successful distributor for us in the Dairy and Livestock area, and we think they're a great platform. We don't really have a strong presence in Brazil in either LPD or the Companion Animal business. It's no one really does, it's an undeveloped market. It's a big animal health market. And so we are excited about that. We also actually acquired a distributor of ours in South Africa, which is going to give us a bit of a go direct benefit in South Africa, combined with a strong local team. So these are just elements of our global strategy of continuing to get that close to customers.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last one, if I could slip it in. Jon, looking back at your placement as to mature both chemistry and hematology, you started the year chemistry, you're thinking up low-single digits and hematology up low-teens . And now I think you mentioned both of those are sitting down mid single digits year-over-year. You went into the year, I believe, knowing that you're going to go ahead and sort of redo the sales force in certain ways. So can you just give us, from a high level, what are you seeing out there in terms of competitive -- competitiveness within placing instruments, and why was that -- why were you experiencing such a big delta. Where you'll end up from where you started the year?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Thank you, John. So the other thing we didn't expect is going to 55% plus competitive placements. I mean, that's a pretty -- that, that's the highest number we've achieved for Q2 was 45%. I mean, Q2 were 55% and 56%. So in competitive placement as a percentage of total, and the absolute number of competitive placements as I mentioned, up nearly 20%. For the first 3 quarters versus prior year was strong. So that was unexpected benefit to our model going forward. That's where the market opportunities, 87% of our -- of consumable or chemistry revenue comes from catalyst customers in North America right now, and they and there's still a lot of -- there are lot of -- they're still customers out there that we're upgrading every day. Obviously, that's makes the 44% of our placement. But I think we're getting better and better and more and more differentiated in talking to customers that are not currently using our technology and explaining some of the benefits, the clearly superior benefits that helps them grow their practicing as they move to certainly our inhouse platform, and combined with our reference lab platform giving them total diagnostic solution with the wraparound of VetConnect PLUS. We are getting better at that and there's a big opportunity out there, continuing opportunity, to grow the business. The other thing that's happening is we've got high loyalty. So once we get them, we keep them. And we're growing utilization of accounts, inspiring them with the importance of diagnostics as part of the practice of business model. And just -- finally, we're adding the tests. What we're adding in the reference lab is good, and we are very, very excited about the new test. It's probably I would call fructosamine the single most important individual test that we've launched in our chemistry platform in the last decade, because it is such an important disease, the diabetes. And just so if you understand, that this is equivalent to HB A1C in the human market. In other words, this measured glucose levels in the dog or cat over the past 2 to 3 weeks average. It's very, very hard to measure glucose, particularly in a cat. I know because I have a diabetic cat now. It's very hard to do so called glucose curves and so fructosamine is valued test and we're going to -- we're the only major platform that's got them on in-house now.","Willard R. Blanche","Just to add a little bit of color on the, what you're mentioning before about the instrument placement numbers. And certainly, they are very strong, just to go back to that, very strong competitive numbers. And so it really points to the VetTest upgrades. That's one thing that we really do believe that in the new diagnostic consultant model, that they are going to become partners with these practices, and that could result in us being able to accelerate the continued transition of our VetConnect prior VetTest customers up to catalyst customers. But even those prior VetTest customers, very loyal group of customers.","Jonathan W. Ayers","We like that customers as much as we like Catalyst customers. They give us good business, they have our in-house platform and it's being what they have showing in that VetTest to pick up the IVLS we've been selling since 2006. They can connect old model into VetConnect PLUS and that's a good customer for us. We'd like to inspire them, that's great. But in the meantime, it's good to have them as a customer in VetTest.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Some. I'm sure we don't want to get too deep into the details for your 2014 guidance, but I was hoping just to maybe get some details on your assumptions for instruments. And then, what are you assuming for the underlying economy?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay, thank you. Again, we're not really in, as you mentioned, in a position to get too detailed, but we do have -- I think it's fair to say, we're going to be, of course, having passed the comps of 2013 with the kinds of things that we've done that brought our instrument revenues down but of course, have done a nice job in growing the recuring revenue portion of the consumables. And so, we also expect that we're going to be really, in 2014, getting to a state of maturity with the new diagnostic model. We just went through the first quarter and the fourth quarter we're primed, we're ready to go. We've got people in position, fourth quarter is an important quarter. But by the time we get to 2014, we're going to have these reps who really know the customers. An average rep is 150, 160 customers really start getting to know them. And again, these are all relatively new territories. And we're going to really see the benefits of not only the expanded feet on the street but the productivity per rep that we think will be a good driver to 2014. With regard to the economy, I don't think we're expecting any great things that are -- I don't expect it to be much different than it was in 2013.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, it's been 3 quarters now since we saw the distribution change. I was just hoping, and I think you've mentioned in the past that MWI continued to see traction there. Any update that you can give us?","Jonathan W. Ayers","It's really the same story that has been all year. All of our distributors are performing well. The relative performance that the different distributors really haven't changed over the course of this year in comparison to prior years. I think we have very, very engaged distributor group, and it really -- there really isn't any change. Distributors are good partners for us. We also recognize that our sales organization are the primary ones in terms of placing instruments and growing diagnostic revenues. We've gotten really great response from distributors for SNAP Pro. They really get it, they see it as basically an iPhone for SNAP. And it's going to be fun to introduce that to the market. And our distributors have been strong partners with us and figuring out exactly how to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, but you gave out the statistic at about 87% of your consumable volume in the U.S. is coming from your Catalyst owner. I guess, intuitively, that you would imply that the VetTest that are still out there in North America are generating pretty low volumes of consumables. And my question is do these clinics you have enough revenue or enough in-house consumable volume to justify upgrading to Catalyst? And is it that you've challenged that maybe you've slowed some of your placements compared to expectations? And second part of this question would be, these clinics do upgrade to Catalyst. I mean, how much do their consumable volume have to increase to really justify the switch?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Well, the fact is they're consumable volume increased about 25%. So that's one of the things that happens. And what we're doing is we're really inspiring to use their in-house lab in a more client-centric way with Real-Time Care. And with this new coverage model, we're going to be back there after we place the instrument. We'll help them in learning how to utilize the instrument. And that's one of the nice things about this new model. You make a good point that we've got a relatively -- that the install base for chemistry is mostly a Catalyst now for our install base. But I have to tell you there is a tremendous opportunity out there. There is still opportunity for upgrades, although probably not as great as it was in a year ago but there's still an opportunity out there. But the big opportunity, which is no smaller today than it was in the past is the competitive switch, which is obviously, buybacks value creator for IDEXX shareholders. And of course, a good value creator for the customers too. And in addition, we do -- there's so much focus in the U.S. but we're doing really well outside the U.S. I mean, I'm very impressed with our teams around the world, whether it is in places like the U.K., or Germany, or Canada just did a great job with the transformation of the IDEXX diagnostics as a sales organization. Australia is doing very well. They were actually the original account coverage model. Japan is doing well. Other emerging markets. So these are all contributing factors to our, as I've mentioned, nearly 11% annuity growth that we saw in Q3 for the Companion Animal Group.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just one final question. I may have missed this in your prepared remarks, Jon, but I just wonder if you could explain what the difference is for the Pet Health Network Pro, 3D versus your base product that's been out there?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Right. So the base product is as you call base line in our pro description basis is a client -- is a software-as-service base client communication tool. So this is what allows you to send out an electronic minders as the Petly page which we've got tremendous response from both practices and pet owners. Where all were health informations online. It allows you to book appointments, integrated with Cornerstone. You can send out newsletters, it allows you to manage your reviews online. With Google and Yelp, this is turning to be a more and more important issue. So all a lot of different functionality in Pet Health Network Pro. And then Pet Health Network 3D is a -- you just have to see it and those of you who come to the North America veterinarian conference -- will is an imagining -- It gives you very clear illustrations, interactive images of different pet conditions. So you look inside the pet. And it helps the veterinarian primarily in the office explain what's going on with the pet. And then e-mail a link to the pet owner and other family members so they can see what is the condition that has been discovered, and what will be the treatment plan. So that's the difference between the two.","Willard R. Blanche","There will be work together. They're both -- they are separate subscriptions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A follow-up on Dave's question from earlier on in your relationships with your existing distributors, but how are those evolved this year with the new diagnostic model, are we expecting, kind of any changes for '14 and '15, and maybe you can remind us when your Patterson and Shine contracts are approval to?","Jonathan W. Ayers","We don't expect any changes. All of our contracts with the exception of the one with MWI, which was a 2-year associated with the change in the moving to nonexclusive in the lower margin. They are all annual, they've always been annual. We expect the annual renewal, we've good relationships with them, we continue to work closely with distributors to help them grow the IDEXX line. The IDEXX line is, it obviously, when you're looking at kind of consumable growth of 15% that they're distributing is an important line. That's a strategic line. So we really expect no change in the model in 2014 or even 2015 from where we are today.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just an update on your German lab venture kind of how where we are today in terms of country penetrated and how much benefit have you had from this rollout and kind of which we anticipate the next 2 years, maybe you better penetrate more countries there?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. So that, we were talking about our Liepzig IDEXX direct lab, which is co-located with DHL in Liepzig Germany. It gives an improved -- it gives really that late pickup early-morning turnaround time that we're used to in the U.S. but is not of standard model in the vast majority of Europe. In key countries that's really helping us grow the lab services in Europe, would of course be Germany, but also Italy. And it's been one of the contributing factors to the success in the Nordic go direct. In fact, we had direct reps there for labs prior to 2013, but now we have the full coverage account model with in-house and lab and we've been very, very successful. But we're going to continue to roll that out to other countries that are supported by the DHL network. If you reflect back strategically, I think it was in 2008 when we opened the Memphis lab and is now the largest lab in North America, because of that very, very successful direct model using FedEx. And we really see long term strategically that Leipzig will -- could be that too in strong partnership with our core lab as really advanced testing capability that works closely with Leipzig in Ludwigsburg. But Leipzig is the fast turnaround overnight results the next morning model. And that's really bringing a completely different service level. So we're not only winning new customers, we are aggressively growing existing customers that are benefiting from that service model.","Willard R. Blanche","And in fact, John, for I think some of the experience, better service levels, we are actually seeing the customers that are of the Leipzig lab growing 30% faster, 30% versus 10% with our other customers. And so we're really seeing just very strong growth and customers are really liking the service that is being provided by the Leipzig lab.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeffrey Frelick - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Jon, a quick question here on how you characterize the new customers to IDEXX. Are these more competitive instrument conversions or are you converting the send outs, moving those more to in-house? And how would you characterize the volumes of these new customers to IDEXX?","Jonathan W. Ayers","Yes. So they are -- I think they are primarily -- those who have another -- don't have IDEXX for their in-house but have an in-house analyzers and they switch to IDEXX. There's, another category of brand new practices. It's a small category but there's always new practices being formed. With regard to, I think over 90%, I would say 90% to 95% of customers already have chemistry analyzer. So it's not like exactly that we are converting people who weren't using in-house lab, they are using in-house lab, although we may be converting people from using their in-house lab to some degree to realizing the benefit of Real-Time Care. So the basic question is, why ask the customer to wait when you can run it now? Why ask the customer to come back? Why ask the customer to come a few days early to run the pre when you can run it the morning of the surgery? In this environment, people don't want to wait. They both want to drive to the practice more often than they had to, conveniences is the order of the day. And I think practices are understanding the convenience model. And our in-house instruments are uniquely designed to provide results within the practice -- within the appointment because of the fast turnaround time for both chemistry and hematology and certainly combined with VetConnect PLUS, we can have those results anytime, anywhere in the practice. So it really is uniquely designed for Real-Time Care scenario. So many times when we upgrade customer to IDEXX technology, they all are running more of their work in-house. I think we've seen a very, very slow -- we talked about this with you in the past. We are seeing a very, very slow shift of core chemistry and hematology from the reference lab to in-houses. Very slow, but it\u2019s happening. These things can happen in slow motion, in the veterinary world. Our reference lab is doing well because we're back filling with new specialized tests and of course, growing that number of customers. So as we introduced a whole new category of cardiac disease, or allergy, or molecular diagnostics, these are -- these things are helping contribute to growth in the reference lab and these are technologies that are not available in the Real-Time Care modality.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. That will come from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions are answered but on capital deployment, I know you didn't give any CapEx guidance, but do you anticipate any major capital expenditures out of the ordinary in 2014? For instance, is their data with your Brazil business or in South Africa that you mentioned?","Willard R. Blanche","No. I don't think so. I mean, we mentioned the CapEx guidance for the current year of around $90 million, but for next year, no. There's nothing that we're expecting.","Jonathan W. Ayers","It's just normal, capital expansion associated with volumes. But that's normal run rate stuff. One of the things that we did complete in 2013 was our expansion here of our facility in May. So we're not going to have to do that again. But there's always growing. When you grow consumable by 15%, you need to continue to invest in production. But that's all in the normal ordinary course of business. We haven't given specific items but I don't see anything unusual in 2014.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And where does the cornerstone adoption stand? Is that growing meaningfully?","Jonathan W. Ayers","We're really pleased with the success with Cornerstone. We've seen -- we had some rep transition issues in our Cornerstone business, kind of like we had in our Digital business that hurts a little bit in the first and second quarter, but we'll talk about taking a little bit longer to get the new digital reps up to speed. We haven't had that issue on Cornerstone. We had a very strong Cornerstone placement. And of course, I think that goes -- it works very, very well with Pethelp network to products. We just remind investors that client communications is really being recognized more and more, a key capability of the practice, and we are the only partner who can provide a client communications tool that is fully integrated with the practice management. And that turns out to be really important because if you want to share exam results, you've got to be integrated. If you want the pet owner to be able to book an appointment with -- through their Petly page, it's going to integrated with the practice management software. And so, I think we're really pleased with the success we had in a moment and we had in both those related product lines, we've got that established in Q3. Thank you for your questionnaire.","Operator","With that, speakers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers","Okay. I want to thank everybody for being on the call. And I certainly want to -- a huge congratulations to our North American sales and marketing organization. They've really stepped up and it was a lot of change and we're through that period now and we're settled down and we're learning new model and it's been a tremendous accomplishment. But we've also had what I would say is extraordinary performance with our regions around the world. So I just want to -- I do want to thank everybody and again, we're going to be looking forward to updating you on the full year performance in January and giving more details on the 2014 outlook. And that concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings release, which can be found on our website, IDEXX.com.","In reviewing our second quarter 2015 results, please note all references to growth and organic growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2014 unless otherwise noted. Also when we refer to normalized organic growth, in addition to adjusting for exchange and acquisitions, we have adjusted for changes in distributor inventory levels.","In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for full-year performance and Jon will follow with his comments and observations.","We had solid results in Q2 supported by consistent organic revenue gains in line with our expectations. In terms of highlights, our second quarter revenues were $413 million, up 6% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange changes over last year resulted in a 7% year-on-year reduction in reported growth and lower operating profits by $7 million or about $0.05 per share, net of hedge benefits. Despite these impacts, we delivered EPS results of $0.60 per share in Q2, up 9% on a reported basis or 18% year-on-year adjusting for FX changes. Results were supported by consistent 11% normalized organic revenue growth and better-than-expected operating margins.","Instrument placements were very strong in the quarter. Worldwide premium placements increased 37% reflecting 44% growth in Catalyst instruments and 30% growth in premium hematology. Overall, we placed approximately 2,400 chemistry and hematology instruments in total in the quarter and we are on track to significantly exceed our global placement goals for this year. John will talk more about this progress in his comments.","Recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues grew 14% organically in the second quarter or 13% when normalized for prior year changes in distributor inventories. These results were in line with our expectations supported by continued strong growth in reference lab and VetLab consumable revenues in U.S. and international markets.","Based on our Q2 performance, we are maintaining a consistent financial outlook for the full year. We will walk through our full-year guidance in more detail later in my comments.","In discussing our results and outlook today, we will focusing on our overall revenue growth including margin capture benefits associated with our transition to a fully direct sales model in the U.S.","Our original estimates of incremental annual revenue from this change were in the range of $50 million to $55 million for 2015. We now estimate these benefits will be approximately $45 million, factoring in our updated revenue growth projections and estimated net impacts from a range of customer service enhancements we've implemented along with the all-direct change, including free next day shipping and a new return policy for expired product.","Given that this change is now fully integrated to our business operations and reporting, we will no longer be estimating the discrete impact of margin capture on specific growth rates.","Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Organic growth in Q2 continued to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $352 million, reflecting 13% normalized organic growth. Our Water business also continued its solid revenue gains, increasing 8% organically to $25 million, reflecting strong existing and new business growth across major regions.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue was $32 million, down modestly as solid gains in Europe, North America and China were offset by tough comparisons to high prior year growth in Australian livestock and poultry testing.","Overall, U.S. revenues were $254 million in the growth, up 13 % organically. U.S. gains were supported by strong instrument revenues and 12% normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflecting continued strong growth in reference lab and instrument consumable sales.","IDEXX performance continues to outpace solid U.S. market growth, reflected in our broadened market growth data set from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q2, this market level data showed patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 6.5%, in line with improved Q1 market growth. International revenues in the second quarter were $159 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. International normalized organic growth was over 11% supported by 13% normalized organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions.","As noted, global instrument placements were outstanding in the quarter, driving 38% organic growth in instrument revenues to $24 million, including approximately 16% of growth benefit from recognition of deferred revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers.","Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $300 million in Q2, up 14% organically or 13% normalized.","Instrument consumable revenues of $101 million grew 19% normalized in Q2, supported by strong global volume gains and net benefits from U.S. margin capture. Continued strong premium instrument placements and high penetration of competitive and greenfield accounts are supporting a continued expansion of our instrument base in U.S. and international markets.","In the U.S., our growing Catalyst installed base now drives approximately 95% of our consumable revenues exclusive of corporate accounts.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $133 million grew organically 12% in the second quarter, supported by strong double-digit volume-driven gains in the U.S. We expect continued strong growth in lab revenues going forward as we leverage our expanded commercial capability and capture benefits from our significantly enhanced and highly differentiated test menu, including recently introduced SDMA and fecal antigen panels.","Rapid assay revenues increased 3% normalized in Q2 to $52 million, consistent with our expectations. Benefits from margin capture and continued strong growth in specialty test offset expected declines in first-generation products and anticipated carryover impacts from first quarter stocking programs. Overall, volumes for 4Dx Test increased year to date as strong growth in lab tests more than offset slight volume declines in clinic. Jon will talk more talk about dynamics in this area in his comments.","Overall Information Management and Digital Imaging System revenues increased 5% supported by 2% organic gains and benefits from recent acquisitions. Information System's revenues increased slightly reflecting growing recurring revenues from an expanded installed base including growth in Pet Health Network Pro.","We successfully advanced our transition towards a subscription-based software-as-a-service model and practice management. As noted in our last call, this transition will moderate near-term revenue growth reflecting the evolution from a license sale driven revenue model to a subscription based model that will provide a powerful foundation for accelerated, highly profitable growth moving forward.","Information Management gains were offset by declines in digital business revenues in the quarter impacted by increased levels at deferred revenue deals associated with bundled business commitments and near-term impacts associated with the alignment of new territory sales accountabilities.","Turning to our P&L review, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter despite continued FX headwinds. Operating profit was 88 million, up 6%. Excluding currency impacts operating profits increased 13%. Operating margins of 21% were in line with prior year levels and better than expected, primarily reflected timing and management of operating expenses in the quarter. Gross profit was $233 million in Q2, up 7% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins increased modestly benefiting from lower product and royalty costs as well as net favorable margin impacts from foreign exchange reflecting benefits from hedge gains.","Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $5 million or $0.04 per share in Q2. Operating expenses increased 7% in Q2 reflecting planned increases in global commercial capability including resources added in support of the U.S. all-direct sales model. Reported operating expense growth was moderated by impacts from foreign exchange.","As noted, EPS was $0.60 per share, up 9% on a reported basis and 18% adjusted for currency impacts. EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year which reduced average share account year-on-year by 9%.","In Q2, repurchased 1,415,000 shares adjusted for our recent two-for-one stock split for $92 million. We ended Q2 with approximately 1.1 billion in debt outstanding including a new \u20ac90 million10-year fixed 1.785% debt issuance funded in June. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change were 2.9 times gross and 2.0 times net of $344 million and cash and investment balances at quarter end, in line with our long-term target leverage range.","Looking ahead, we're maintaining our full-year outlook which includes expectations for higher second half revenue growth supported by our innovation pipeline. We're maintaining our 2015 revenue guidance range at $1.60 billion to $1.62 billion reflecting our outlook for 12% to 13% normalized organic revenue growth. This reflects expectations for higher expected revenue growth in the second half associated with benefits from our recently launched SDMA and fecal antigen tests in reference labs, our Total T4 slide for Catalyst Dx and a new SNAP test for leptospirosis. We also expect growth benefits from relatively more favorable comparisons in the second half in select areas including lapping of Q4 2014 programs in support of the U.S. direct transition.","At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate that effects in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce full-year revenue growth by about 6% and adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.13 per share. Please note that our 2015 profit outlook benefits from about $21 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains from previously established contracts which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to about $0.16 per share in after-tax EPS benefit. At current rates and timing of hedge contracts, we will not have the benefit of these hedge gains in 2016.","Our 2015 EPS outlook is $2.07 to $2.12, which is consistent with our prior outlook adjusted for a recent two-for-one stock split. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 11% to 13% growth over 2014 adjusted EPS levels which included about $0.03 per share benefit from the extension of the R&D tax credit. Other elements of our full-year profit outlook are basically consistent with our prior guidance including expectations for an effective tax rate of about 30%.","Please note that our 2015 tax rate outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit, which has been renewed every year since 1997. Assuming renewal, we would expect an incremental EPS benefit of approximately $0.04 per share this year.","We're also maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 80% to 90% of net income, incorporating higher working capital levels associated with the U.S. all-direct transition and consistent expectations for capital spending levels of about $100 million this year, driven in part by capacity expansion in our labs business and in our manufacturing operations in support of business growth.","For Q3, we expect a 1% to 2% improvement in our normalized organic growth rate, reflecting benefits from new product introductions and a favorable expected normalization benefit related to prior-year distributor inventory changes. At FX rates assumed in our press release, this should correspond to Q3 revenue in the $405 million to $410 million range. We expect Q3 operating margins will be 18.5% to 19%.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian. As Brian indicated, we reported solid results for the second quarter, in line with our expectations. We are well-positioned for accelerating organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, given our unprecedented level of recently announced innovations and an enhanced global commercial capability.","Our instrument placement performance in the second quarter was strong. Overall, we placed about 2,400 chemistry and hematology instruments in the quarter, nearly matching our record fourth quarter 2014. These 2,400 placements were up 29% year-over-year and 21% over the excellent Q1 results.","The placements were composed of 1,132 Catalyst Chemistry Analyzers up 44% year-over-year; 318 VetTest Chemistry units; and 949 premium hematology placements, up 30% year-over-year and 27% over the first quarter. The premium hematology placements were driven by the higher end ProCyte analyzer, which was up 44% versus the prior year.","Our international performance was truly outstanding where Catalyst placements of 683 units were up 137% from a respectable Q2 2014 and hematology placements were up 55%. In Q2, we continued the global rollout of Catalyst One with launches in Australia and Brazil and will complete our Catalyst One launches in non-Japan Asia and the rest of Latin America in Q3. North America had a solid premium instrument placement quarter of 909 units, accelerating 15% over Q1. Of the 449 Catalyst placements in North America, 61% were to new and competitive accounts, a high-water mark matched only once before.","We have a strong pipeline of orders in North America entering Q3 with good sales momentum as our expanded sales organization is deepening their relationships in their geographically more concentrated territories. The smaller territories allowing for greater customer intimacy, our goal, as we \u2013 as our sales expansion has now been in place six months. Our sales professionals are also continuing to advance as subject matter experts and diagnostics in the unique value of our offerings.","Globally, Catalyst One has been an unrivalled success in every country in which it has been introduced. In fact, we are on track to place well over 9,000 chemistry and hematology units globally in 2015. This includes a forecast of over 4,500 Catalyst Chemistry placements for the year, up 45% from 2014. This outlook bodes well for sustained double-digit instrument consumable growth for years to come.","Other news in our VetLab modality includes the full launch of Total T4 slide in North America, including to our large installed base of Catalyst Dx customers. The availability of this important component of the chemistry profile and its ability to be included with any chemistry panel with up to 22 other chemistries in one sample run with quick turnaround time is unique to the IDEXX Catalyst platform and brings a new differentiated value to our Catalyst Dx install base, augmenting the already high installed base royalty.","The new Total T4 slide also contributes to the increasing recurring diagnostic revenue growth in the second half of the year. Note that the T4 slide has already been available to Catalyst One customers since February, where we already had an over 60% adoption rate. Our global reference lab modality continues to see strong double-digit growth of 12%, with a couple of points' higher growth in the U.S.","A few comments on SDMA. The full launch of SDMA in the U.S. is underway in July as we indicated in a press release earlier this week. Numbers are accumulating quickly. As mentioned in the earnings release this morning, we now have over 9,000 accounts that have received over 140,000 patient SDMA results. Mostly as part of their routine send-out chemistry panels but also including standalone SDMA submissions. An interesting fact, these numbers include submissions from over 1,000 accounts who use a competitive reference lab as their primary lab.","With this overall volume utilization at our customers, you can see why we expect SDMA will transition in a relatively short period of time from an exciting novel assay to an indispensable element of our customers' routine protocol for preventative and sick animal testing. In this way, the inclusion of an SDMA result will become the new standard of care in chemistry testing, diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease, one of the most common feline and canine medical conditions.","In addition, we're offering a send-out SDMA result at no incremental charge for customers who use both our in-house chemistry instrument and our reference lab services, when they run a patient sample on their Catalyst Chemistry Analyzer in-house. This bundled profile offering further builds the value of using IDEXX for both in-house and reference lab diagnostics, increasing loyalty and supporting cross-selling of reference lab services and in-house equipment. We expect Canada will start the full SDM launch \u2013 SDMA launch next week and our other international labs will roll out the full launch over the first half of 2016.","We were excited this week that the International Renal Interest Society, or IRIS, has endorsed SDMA by recognizing that SDMA is a new biomarket for renal dysfunction that can allow for earlier detection of chronic kidney disease. According to IRIS, \"SDMA has the potential to expand diagnostic insight and therapeutic opportunities for veterinarians caring for pets with this critical disease.\" In fact, IRIS announced in a press release this morning that SDMA is now included as a component of their well-known IRIS chronic kidney staging guidelines.","For investor background, IRIS is a board of 15 world-renowned independent veterinarians, with a particular expertise in nephrology, from 10 different countries. The endorsement of SDMA by IRIS is a capstone to the credibility of 27 peer-reviewed abstracts and publications already available on SDMA in the cat and the dog.","In addition to the T4 slide in SDMA, we had a third important customer product announcement this month. We're excited to have begun shipping our SNAP Lepto rapid assay in July. This highly valued point-of-care test is very much appreciated by our customers. Early adopters and key opinion leaders indicate that every practice should have a SNAP Lepto Test kit available in practice to use when a dog is presented with the common symptoms of leptospirosis and when it's on the differential list so as to rule out or aid in the diagnosis of this disease. Note that leptospirosis is contagious and highly dangerous to pets and humans alike. We expect SNAP Lepto will contribute $1 million to $2 million in rapid assays in the second half of this year and continue to contribute to the rapid assay growth for years to come.","As Brian indicated, our rapid assay modality revenues met our expectations in Q2. During the quarter, we completed several direct head-to-head studies including one that was peer-reviewed by key opinion leaders and experts, which compare recently available competitive rapid assays test to the high standard of our SNAP ELISA platform assays. These studies demonstrate that our assays, including our feline kits and our SNAP 4Dx, have superior sensitivity, that is, the ability to detect the presence of certain diseases, as compared to the more recent offerings and assays for these same diseases that use a lateral flow platform based on the types of positive patients typically seen in practice.","As an example, the peer-reviewed study shows a comparison of sensitivity of SNAP 4Dx versus a competitive offering for ehrlichia ewingii on lateral flow. In this case IDEXX 4Dx had 92% sensitivity versus 60% for the lateral flow test. The head-to-head differences in test sensitivity are quite meaningful.","Veterinarians rate test accuracy is by far the most important criteria in choosing a diagnostic test kit, as well they should, when the sole purpose of such test kits is to accurately determine which patients have contracted an infectious disease to enable prompt follow-on care. Positive patients that are missed because the test has inferior sensitivity can not only result in the incorrect diagnosis but also lost income from missed follow-on diagnostics, treatments, and monitoring.","We are well-positioned to bring this clinical data to our SNAP customers with our U.S. direct sales organization, including our 181 veterinary diagnostic consultants and 14 professional service veterinarians. It will take time to reach the entire market and the long-tail customers who rely on SNAP accuracy, and to address the incorrect assumption that competitive lateral flow tests are of equivalent accuracy. However, we are confident in our unique ability to do so with our fully direct sales model and to continue to support the profession with a strong rapid assay franchise in 2015 and years to come.","We continue to be on track with the development of our urine sediment analyzer called SEDIVUE for launch in early 2016. This novel point-of-care technology provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to conduct an in-house urine analysis which is currently a manual bench-top process requiring time-consuming sample prep and microscopic examination, conducted by virtually all veterinary practices and usually several times a day. With this new instrument, the entire market is a greenfield opportunity. Each instrument placement will generate a new stream of consumable revenues without any cannibalization to further differentiate our entire in-house lab solution.","On a concluding note, and before we open the call to Q&A, please note that we will be broadcasting our Annual Investor Day next Wednesday and Thursday. During that presentation, we will be detailing several of our novel innovations and key technologies, and dimensioning the size of the global market opportunity and their role in driving long-term double-digit organic revenue growth.","Five of these include, first, the long-term opportunity for Catalyst One placements and the continuing impact on recurring instrument consumable growth; second, SDMA and the impact this revolutionary advancement in the core chemistry panel will have on our recurring revenues; third, the greenfield opportunity for SEDIVUE instrument and consumable stream in the automation of in- house urinalysis; fourth, our fecal antigen franchise, another greenfield opportunity, including the recently launched reference lab offering and our fecal product roadmap; fifth, finally, the role that our proprietary bovine pregnancy testing offering will have to grow our livestock and poultry diagnostic business on a global basis.","In addition, we will discuss our long-term goals to expand margins, enabled by our innovations and organic revenue growth.","With that, I open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, let me start with one for you regarding to head-to-head studies. I've seen several of them recently on your website. I guess my curiosity is how quickly do you think you can get that message of the superior sensitivity into the market? And then when that has been presented to veterinarians, have you seen that actually resonate quickly and then switching back to your assays once they understand the sensitivity?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Ryan, thank you for the question. We just had a \u2013 I was with the \u2013 our U.S. sales organization all week last week and I'm really impressed. These reps have over 10 years of sales experience. Of course many of them are new to IDEXX, hired last fall. But they're coming up to speed quickly. We talked about the head-to-head studies, including the new peer-reviewed study that I mentioned for ehrlichia, and I think they're going to be quite good at that. The experience we have, even before the peer-reviewed, is that when customers appreciate the differences in sensitivity, they do switch back. Of course, there are a lot of customers to reach. We have a long tail of customers particularly for our feline products, but of course a smaller number but a significant number on our SNAP 4Dx, a fabulous franchise.","And so I suspect that we'll be quite effective. But as I mentioned, it will probably take time to reach that group with our normal calling patterns over the next quarter or two. When we do, we're very effective in switching customers back on the ones that have decided to try the newer lateral flow assays; of course most are loyal to IDEXX.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful color. And then, one follow-up on SDMA and I'll hop back in the queue, I think you mentioned a 1,000 clinics that use another lab as their primary lab provider. Do you have a feel for many of them you actually had been working with prior to the SDMA launch? So is it \u2013 they're sending them to you but you've already had relations, are a lot of these novel relationships? And then can you remind me the price of that for them versus the price of a full chemistry profile? Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. So, the 1,000 accounts that are not \u2013 do not use IDEXX as their primary lab, typically they use us at a very low, or if any, volume. The SDMA that they're sending us sometimes it's their entire chemistry panel because they want the SDMA result with the chemistry panel, other times it's just the SDMA result. In fact probably more often than not it's the entire chemistry panel. And that's a mix of customers who have done business with us. Obviously we have a (30:50 \u2013 30:52) testing portfolio and customers that haven't done business with us. But I will say, I'm pretty surprised that just in a few short weeks we have a 1,000 accounts that aren't our primary lab customers who have adopted this new test and are using it. I've just never seen anything like that in terms of adoption of a new specialized test. In this case of course it's really now a component, critical component of the core chemistry panel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned the change in disclosure on the margin capture and the lower contribution relative to your initial view. So, on a net basis at this point, what are you gaining in the way of economics this year from the direct transition?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","The \u2013 as you mentioned the revenue number, we modified down a bit from the $50 million to $55 million range to the $45 million range. I think on a \u2013 it's fully (31:57 \u2013 31:59) with our business now, so it's a little tougher to parse but I think that net flow-through is probably more in the breakeven level to modestly accretive versus the $5 million to $8 million benefit that we had anticipated. Going back in time, we didn't do this for $5 million to $8 million of profitability, obviously this was intended to be a significant step-up in our commercial capability, allow us to fund that, and to position us well for accelerated long-term growth and we feel very good about the progress we're making on that front.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Erin, I would comment, really building on Brian's comments that if you think for example the SDMA launch, that was a virtually false launch but we couldn't have reached 90% of veterinarians including more than half that learned about it from their representative in the first six months without a direct sales model. And so \u2013 and that was a just very, very successful launch. It's an example of what our direct sales organization allows us to do that we haven't been able to do previously.","And just a follow-up on Ryan's question, I realize I didn't answer the last part. For customers who send in a full chemistry panel, the average price is, for a chemistry panel, might be $30 to $40, but for an SDMA-only result we offer that for $19.95, so it gives you a sense of the revenue contribution depending on how they submit their sample.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. And there has been a lot of noise out there and I would just like you to comment I guess or characterize the pricing trends across your business relative to the volume contribution, particularly in the consumable side of the business I guess as well as in instruments?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","We are a volume-driven business, always have been, but our pricing trends are positive. As we noted in our results, we had actually an improvement in our gross margins in the quarter and our underlying recurring CAG Diagnostic margins also improved. So net-net we are very much focused on growing the volume in our business consistent with our business strategy but we've seen effectively kind of consistent impacts of net pricing changes and we're able to improve our margins as we grow.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and just a follow-up on that Erin, with regard to the instruments in particular, we have a variety of different types of programs. There really was no change in those programs from prior quarters.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will go the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks, and good morning. I'll try to fit into two questions, maybe the first one will have two parts so just stay with me for a second. Jon, you maintain the guidance for the company but clearly your cornerstone data and our checks show that the industry has really picked up over the past six months. So can you talk about what that means for your implied market share losses so far this year? And as a function of that sort of do you think you are through the noise? I mean, again, I believe you lost share over the past six to nine months. I think that was a cost-sensitive crowd. You put out huge instruments numbers today to be fair. So, what's your conviction that there is sort of \u2013 you are through the noise, there is not a broader cost-sensitive crowd out storm to come? That's part one.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A couple of comments, I believe that our recurring revenue growth was in excess of the market growth in the U.S. and of course we're a global company and then we have pretty strong performance in other businesses like the water business with 8% organic growth. So I'm very pleased with our performance in the U.S. As I mentioned our U.S. lab businesses was higher than our total global lab growth of 12% by a couple points. So, we're very pleased with where we are in the growth of the recurring diagnostic revenues in the U.S. and on a global basis. In addition, I think our \u2013 I think we've correctly gauged where we are in the new competitive environment and our guidance and our tracking is consistent with the guidance that we gave three months ago.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, I will push you offline I guess, but to shift gears, according to our work, or looking at the P&L, the unallocated again seems to have accounted for the EPS upside. And Brian, I know there is always fluctuations but it looks like there is actually like a contra expense item in there for both 1Q and 2Q 2015 because EBIT's higher than gross profit, I went back, that's never happened in any of the other 36 quarters in my model going back to 2005. So, can you at a high level, and we don't need to get into all of the nuances of accounting, but can you just sort of walk through that, what's going on in unallocated that's leading to that event? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It's lower product costs for companion animal and LPD products. We record the segment results at a standard cost and the capitalized variances which are favorable for us, meaning that we had lower product costs than standard flowing through the unallocated portion. So, it is a net lower product cost for the company that just happens to be reflected in that segment.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And so it happened in the past six months and never in the prior nine years, I'm just curious, so is that a function of going direct or something else in terms of the timing of that?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It just \u2013 I can't speak to the past...","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it is a function...","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Last nine years but I think this is \u2013 we had benefits from lower product costs that got capitalized into inventory and now they're flowing through, that just reflect our...","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good cost performance on the product side.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good operations management and...","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And any change between expensing versus capitalizing or no?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","No, it's just where it is recorded, Jon, that's all.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, okay guys.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","We record at standard in the segments and we capitalize the variance and have that flowing through in unallocated, it's not an unusual practice.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough, all right, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. I just want to get a better sense of CAG gross margins. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've had CAG gross margins down year-over-year and considering that you are seeing double-digit recurring revenue, I would have assumed that we might have seen maybe a bit of improvement there particularly with the margin recapture, just \u2013 so I wanted to better understand kind of what's going on in CAG gross margins. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, it builds up the question that we just answered which is we have lower product costs flowing through the unallocated segment and if you put that into the CAG picture, they would be actually improved. And the \u2013 actually the \u2013 keep in mind that as we have very strong instrument placements and the recognition of deferred revenue that has a bit of a negative mix impact on CAG. The underlying CAG recurring margins are improving. So I think the reported segment margin was only down 40 basis points and net-net the underlying CAG recurring margins including the product cost benefits have improved. So we actually see a positive trend on CAG recurring margins.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful color. And then secondly on the implied 2H organic revenue growth expectations, I think your normalized first half of the year is roughly 11.2%, 11.3% and in the full year it's 12% to 13%. So is there any buckets specifically that you could call out in terms of we expect SNAP Lepto to be a 50-basis-point improvement, we expect SDMA to be this, just wanted to get better comfort because I think there is a lot of concern surrounding the implied acceleration, so any incremental color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you. It's actually \u2013 first of all we have \u2013 we do have several new product launches that we've talked about in the last few weeks, all of which will benefit the second half as we've mentioned the T4 slide to our Dx installed base, the SNAP Lepto and the full launch of SDMA in our reference labs. In addition, we have some favorable compares in the second half with regard to some Q4 marketing programs that we had in the U.S. in 2014 associated with our go-direct and a little bit more favorable compare in our livestock and poultry business.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. So your rapid test business came in pretty stable and I was wondering if you could maybe talk about some of the competitive dynamics that you are seeing with the competition and lower-priced assays. Jon, can you comment on the 4Dx and your confidence in continuing to \u2013 or just clarification that you do not expect to lose share in that segment and really what is driving that? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So our rapid assay modality overall tracked our expectations obviously of 4Dx which is by far the largest product in that category (41:32 \u2013 41:34) is \u2013 has to be a contributing factor there. Our volume actually in the first half of the year on 4Dx has grown. Sometimes customers use the 4Dx in the lab and sometimes they use it in clinic, sometimes they switch. And so when we look at the volumes across the two modalities, we've seen growth.","And I think we've made a lot of progress in understanding the relative performance of our assays in the critical dimension of sensitivity, which of course is the dimension. That's the reason why customers purchase these rapid assay tests, is to determine whether a patient is \u2013 has contracted the infectious disease. We've seen some customers in some regions such as those that are more ehrlichia endemic temporarily switch to a competitive offering for ehrlichia. But when they are informed of the difference in \u2013 of the pretty dramatic difference in sensitivity, we get them back. And so that's a constant process. There are a lot of customers out there that we've got to talk to. And we've got new assets that are available to us as a result of the work we've done over the last quarter that is now in the hands of our sales organization.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And my second question is we're hearing some rather aggressive commercial tactics from some of your competition and can you maybe just characterize maybe some of the instruments that other providers are throwing in to win business. You've been in this business a long time, so how would you characterize this type of activity? Do you foresee it occurring in many additional quarters? And how do you think you can continue to hold ground given this shift?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's always been a competitive market and we sell on really what is a lower cost system solution, when you take all factors into consideration. Our sales force, which was greatly expanded before the beginning of the year, is getting better and better at not only the customer relationships but being able to have that conversation. We are pleased with the premium instrument placement growth we saw in the U.S. in the second quarter over the first quarter. Of course that doesn't even speak to the extraordinary performance we had on a global basis on instrument placements.","And there is really \u2013 if there is no difference in the economics of our programs as was asked by \u2013 in a previous question, and we've got the most complete product line when you look at our full instrument product line and of course our reference labs and when we can do a multimodal profile as we talked about on our in-house chemistry, with our send-out SDMA result. And the T4 is a wonderful addition not only to \u2013 of course we had it on Catalyst One but for the Dx which builds further differentiated value.","We believe we continue to be unique in the ability to do two-way integration with the vast majority of practice management software that is in practice because it was built into that practice management software over many years. And the performance of our analyzers is uniquely designed for real-time care with quick turnaround time and minimum tech involvement.","And so that with continued advancements in VetConnect PLUS for example where we had, I think, 100% growth in utilization VetConnect PLUS year-over-year in the U.S. market, really combined \u2013 that combined and a maturing commercial capability with a unprecedented product line really, we feel quite comfortable in this competitive environment","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I would also just build on Jon's comments just to highlight that, of course we noted that we had a very strong premium instrument placement quarter in the U.S. with a high-water mark for the percentage going into competitive and greenfield accounts. And of note, we are expanding, and noted in our comments that we're expanding our instrument base in chemistry and hematology in the U.S.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Each quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, it is expanding.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's net of customers who stopped using us, so it's a net expansion.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I wanted to go back to one of the \u2013 I think Nick's question on the CAG gross margins, Brian. Could you help explain with the lower product cost that helped drive the unallocated amount, I guess, why would that be in unallocated versus CAG?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It's just a methodology we use for where we record it in segment recording for simplicity. For internal management, we use a standard cost for the business areas in terms of how they record their profit performance and if there is variances to performance then they get capitalized into inventory before they get recognized through the P&L. We capture that in the unallocated portion just to \u2013 as a way to kind of limit some of the noise on the internal management of the business.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, our internal management responsibility accounting is based on standard costs as you would expect and then our global worldwide operations folks are the ones who are doing quite a good job beating those standard costs.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And so it's \u2013 the numbers were beneficial and that's what you see flowing through and they're somewhat larger than they had been in the past but it's reflective of good underlying business performance and strong volumes. And so that is a \u2013 it's a real benefit in that it's supporting improved CAG recurring diagnostic gross margins.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great, that's helpful. And then, so you provided some \u2013 an update on the distribution margin capture which you've revised a little bit lower. Just wondering why you've decided to stop disclosing kind of what the breakup or the benefit was on \u2013 for each of your segments, is this how you are going to report going forward?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, we're obviously trying to give you an overall calibration so the net benefit is about 3% on growth versus the original 3.5% overall. When you get down at the modality level, we really have this fully integrated in our business now and so trying to parse the discrete impacts of adjustments we might be making across modalities related to the change, it's not how we are measuring the business. We're obviously measuring ourselves on our current revenues and it is becoming just harder to kind of estimate that with precision.","So, we've given directional indications in the past on the benefit by modality and those are directionally consistent and obviously we've updated the overall number, but we're trying to move to a zone where we're talking about the revenues that we're measuring ourselves on and the revenues that drive our profitability performance and that's why we're moving away from this with and without calculation.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And next we'll go to a follow-up from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks, and thanks for taking the follow-up. Just two real quick ones, Jon, you gave us a little bit more color on U.S. lab noise out there as well but we certainly haven't thought you were losing share and I think you proved that today. You mentioned a couple of hundred basis points higher than the 12% worldwide, is that still predominantly volume? In the past, you've given us some color that in the U.S. it was vast, vast majority volume. Again broadly speaking, is that mostly a volume driven 14% or so?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes that is correct. It's predominantly volume-led.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then the flipside, just I want to make sure I've got my arms around the rapid because maybe it's just myself being a curmudgeon but I don't view it as that strong. You print 8.5% organic but 5.9% is from some of the inventory fluctuations. So that gets you I believe to that 3% you sort of detail in the press release. And I know you are not giving the margin capture anymore but if it was anywhere close to last quarter of 9%, that would make the true organic down 6% and the D cell from last quarter is down 3%. So one most importantly, am I thinking it through correctly, and two can you just siphon through the noise and give us what you think is really going on in the trends in your rapid assay business? Thanks guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you for the \u2013 I think that's \u2013 for the question, Jon. I think that's directionally direct and also consistent with the \u2013 our calibration of the business last quarter and the expectations that we set. So I think it's entirely in line with expectations. What we are pleased about is the new assets, an appreciation we have for the differences in our products in the critical area of test sensitivity. And we now have those \u2013 recently, obviously this is all very recently, have those resources in the field to be able to have those conversations. So that's I think a positive development from a marketing perspective but with regard to volumes, they are \u2013 the volumes were consistent with the expectations that we had them set in our April call.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Thanks Jon.","Operator","Thank you and we have a follow-up from Nick Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, one, just quick numbers questions. Brian, I think you said earlier that you thought third quarter organic revenue growth would be up 1 to 2 points relative to the first half. Was that \u2013 did I hear that correctly? I just want to confirm that and if that is correct, does that imply kind of 13% to 14% or so in the fourth quarter based on the full-year guide? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It's 1% to 2% improvement in the normalized organic growth rate. Keep in mind we will have a favorable normalization benefit related to prior-year distributed inventory changes that get factored into that, but it is an improvement and we do to expect improvement in fourth quarter as well kind of building momentum as we are rolling out the new product introductions and that's built into the full-year growth outlook.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","You did.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow-up from Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. I think you've done a nice job with the SDMA in the early goings here especially with competitive accounts. Jon, maybe could you try to quantify the uplift you think SDMA can hit your topline even directionally at roughly $20 per test for those that are not using your full panel. And then can you comment on (53:04 \u2013 53:06) patients of taking share or folks that migrate to your entire reference lab?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, thank you for the question. Really as a result of years of work, including with the key opinion leaders and six months of preparing the market since we announced SDMA would be part of the core chemistry panel, we concluded a flawless launch earlier this month. And of course it's all in Q3, it's not reflected in our Q2 numbers. And really the excitement and the adoption rate is just quite gratifying.","The SDMA will drive our growth on a number of dimensions. Higher loyalty with our current reference lab customers, greater utilization in preventive care, the ability to have greater price realization when we're faced with \u2013 a loyal customer who's faced with a competitive offering \u2013 a competitive offer that does not include SDMA. Of course, winning new accounts who want to instead of just sending us their \u2013 splitting their samples and sending their core to someone else and their SDMA to us and increasing their costs significantly, as a result just sending the entire chemistry panel to us. We have customers who routinely split their business between us and someone else who will, as they understand quickly and adopt SDMA, will be predisposed to seeing their chemistry panels to us if they haven't before. And then, finally, incremental revenue from the 1995 SDMA-only results.","To your question about dimensionalizing that, we look forward to doing that next week at our analyst meeting, that is our intent. And I think we'll be able to fully satisfy your question in that regard at that time.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. I want to thank everybody who's been on the call. I know we also have a number of IDEXXers who are on the call or who will subsequently listen in. And I just want to congratulate our organization here for some extraordinary accomplishments in Q2. It really was an extraordinary quarter for the instrument business on a global basis. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves and everybody else that we are a global organization and Catalyst One is really just a blockbuster instrument. The flawless SDMA launch which we had in Q3, a wave of innovations that we're bringing to the market beyond those two products in terms of T4 on a slide, SDMA, we just introduced images for histo and cyto pathologies that are available on VetConnect PLUS, which is a wonderful advancement in the VetConnect PLUS form of receiving results and unique to IDEXX, and I think we have some great success in getting a better appreciation for the differentiation of our infectious disease assays and an organization globally that is really quite engaged.","So my gratitude to everyone at IDEXX who helps deliver these results and we look forward to the Analyst Day next week. We will be broadcasting that in our Reg FD forum for all investors to hear and look forward to detailing the long-term organic growth, double digit that we think will come out of our innovation and our comments on margin expansion over the long term and then going into some detail in some of our strategies.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Merilee Raines.","Merilee Raines","Good morning and thanks for joining us today, as we discuss our fourth quarter 2012 results and outlook for 2013. As we reported this morning, our fourth quarter revenues were $319.5 million, yielding organic growth of 4% and diluted earnings per share were $0.78, a year-to-year increase of 16%. Organic revenue growth was a couple of points shy of our expectation at the time of our third quarter call, with the primarily shortfalls coming from revenue associated with capital placements and our reference labs and consulting services.","As I will explain in further detail momentarily, there were some transitory factors that impacted results such as weather, most notably Hurricane Sandy as well as the timing of the Christmas and New Year holidays. We estimate that their combined impact reduced topline growth by nearly one point.","And looking at the components of overall growth, the metrics for the fundamental growth and value drivers in our principal companion animal businesses, which are chemistry and hematology instrument placements, instrument consumable growth, reference laboratory and rapid assay growth are all very sound and portend well in our view for accelerating growth in 2013.","Earnings per share exclusive of the third and final milestone payment of $3.5 million or $0.04 related to the sale in late 2008 of our feline diabetes therapeutics were a couple of pennies above our thinking, due primarily to efficiencies achieved in operating expenses. Currency had an immaterial impact on EPS versus our expectations.","Before discussing our fourth quarter performance, as we customarily do, I want to share what we are seeing in the U.S. veterinary market based on data from a subset of our Cornerstone Practice Management customers. In the fourth quarter patient visits grew by about 3% and practice revenues grew by 5%. Growth in patient visits in October was roughly a point lower than the average for the quarter and based on the geographic trends, we attribute this largely to the effects of Hurricane Sandy.","Normalizing for Sandy's impact, we project patient visit growth for the quarter would have been about 3.5%, very much in line with the second and third quarter metrics. Quite consistently throughout the year, we have seen practice revenue growth a couple of points higher than patient visit growth, which we believe indicates that practices are achieving some modest price realization.","In Europe overall, our Companion Animal Group businesses grew organically at just over 4%, about a point step-down from the growth rate for the first nine months. Though, Spain remains troubled and we saw a slight deterioration in growth in France, performance in Italy improved and Germany remains solid and steady.","We were pleased with a nice acceleration and growth in the U.K. and emerging markets in Eastern Europe. Q4 was a quarter of readying for our transition towards direction companion animal sales force in the Nordic region and we expect that to be a growth contributor in 2013.","Organic growth in Asia-Pacific across our total portfolio of businesses was mid teens for the quarter and just shy at 20% for the year. In sound, as we enter 2013, we continue to expect a little contribution from the macro environments in the U.S. and Europe to our topline growth. However, the continued development of earlier stage markets combined with our rollout of new product and service innovations internationally will be an important growth factor for 2013 and beyond.","Let me now give some further detail on the revenue performance of our Companion Animal Group. VetLab instruments and consumable revenue of $109.5 million grew 7% organically. Instrument revenue at $24.6 million declined 14% organically year-to-year. As we have noted on several occasions, the success of our protocol-based rebate program that was introduced in the third quarter of 2011 in North America makes for difficult comparison in the second half of 2012.","Additionally, instrument revenue growth was negatively impacted by roughly 8 points and total company topline growth by about 0.75 point with the launch of a reagent rental program in the fourth quarter. Under this type of program, revenue on instrument placement and its related cost are not recorded at the time of instillation, but are instead recognized as consumables are purchased over the term of the arrangement, which is typically five years.","We have seen this program resonate with larger clinics that have relatively higher consumable usage and the consumable annuity stream and associated economics for us are also particularly compelling. In part, due to the success of this program and with impressive performance internationally, we had solid chemistry performance in the fourth quarter that translated to 3% unit growth for the year in line with expectations we shared at the time of our third quarter call.","Commercial focus on new and competitive accounts, armed with our medical information and workflow advantages as well as program tools such as protocol-based rebates and reagent rental contributed to high quality of placements in the fourth quarter. The percentage of new to IDEXX's chemistry accounts, including both Catalyst and VetTest was in excess of 60% for the fourth quarter.","Focusing on Catalyst alone, nearly 50% of our placements, which are customers new to IDEXX compared to 40% for the first three quarters of the year and 30% in the second half of 2011. This metric was consistent across all geographies. We noted last quarter, the overall value to IDEXX of a new Catalyst customer is four to five times that of an upgrade of a VetTest customer, based on gross profit of the instrument and the five year consumable streams for an average placement.","For Hematology, we continue to see strong performance for the quarter in our ProCyte placements. For the year ProCyte placements grew 20% on a worldwide basis, the major driver of 11% growth in hematology placements overall. As with Catalyst, we saw an increase in the percentage of ProCyte placements to new accounts, climbing to about 40% in the quarter. Also in Q4 and for the year, roughly 80% of ProCyte were sold to Catalyst customers with approximately 60% of that subset being to temporaneous purchase of both instruments, evidence of the important role that the dual plays in enabling real-time care.","For 2013, we expect chemistry placement growth to be low-single digit, about on par with what we experienced in 2012. For hematology, we expect low-teen growth, aided by the recent launch of LaserCyte DX and continued strong international performance, based on the success of the reagent rental program with large accounts, both existing VetTest customers and competitive accounts. We will likely continue with a similar program in 2013.","While the accounting treatment for such a program results in muted instrument revenue growth in the near term that is reflected in our overall guidance, the annuity benefit to consumable growth is very compelling from both the revenue and an operating profit perspective. Consumable revenues, up $72.4 million, grew organically 16% or 13% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. This strong result, our highest growth quarter for the year, brought our full year 2012 normalized organic growth to 10%.","Our growth continues to be a function of our increasing installed base and the quality of those placements. Increased testing, as current IDEXX customer upgrade their in-house lab with Catalyst and ProCyte, and enhanced loyalty from our base of Catalyst customers who now account for more than 80% of our U.S. chemistry consumable sales volumes, exclusive of corporate accounts. For 2013, we expect the fundamental trends driving consumable volume growth to continue.","In addition, we expect revenue growth will be further enhanced by price realization, due to changes in our sales channels both with the MWI margin in the U.S., and from the move from distribution to a direct sales model in Scandinavia as well as a lower unfavorable price impact from protocol-based rebate program that have reached more of a steady state. All of this translates to an expectation of 11% to 13% normalized organic growth for instrument consumables for 2013.","In the fourth quarter, our rapid assay sales of $33.7 million declined organically by 5%. When normalized for changes and distributor inventory levels, revenues were flat for the quarter and grew by 5.5% for the full year, which was in line with our expectations of 4% to 6%. To remind, we had anticipated a step-down in normalized organic growth from the 7% experienced through the first three quarters of the year. About half of the step-down in growth reflects the impact of a smaller price increase in October of 2012 versus the prior year.","Additionally, based on geographic revenue data we received from distribution, we believe there was a modest impact of approximately 1.5 point to rapid assay growth related to Hurricane Sandy. The remainder of the step-down is primarily related to the timing of marketing programs within the second half of the year.","Our expectation for 2013 is to see normalized organic growth rates in the range of 46% for the rapid assay business on par with 2012. Growth will come primarily from further expansion of our Canine Vector-borne disease testing in North America, as fostered by 4Dx Plus. Recall that 4Dx Plus was launched in 2012, as the Vector-borne disease testing season was winding down. In 2013, it will be available for the full testing season.","Additionally, continued ramp on specialty test in Europe and the anticipated launch of other enhancements to the product line as well as some price realization from distribution margin changes in both the U.S. and Japan, and list price increases, all contribute to rapid assay growth expectations. U.S. distributor inventory for instrument consumables and rapid assays average to a little over four weeks at the end of the fourth quarter based on forward-looking demand, which is within their normal and customary range.","Our reference laboratory and consulting services business with revenues of $97.7 million grew organically 6% in the fourth quarter. Based on daily testing volume trend data, we estimate that our growth rate was impacted by both the midweek timing of the holidays in 2012 versus prior year as well as Hurricane Sandy.","When combined, we believe these transitory factors reduced lab and consulting services revenue growth by approximately 2% in the quarter. Normalizing for these events, labs and consulting services growth was approximately 8% for both the quarter and the year, and the sequential normalized growth marked a continued modest acceleration from the growth rates experienced in Q2 and Q3.","As we stated in our third quarter call, in October we opened our new core lab in Germany, which will serve as a centralized hub for testing samples picked up by our European logistics partners, DHL. We believe this lab will enable us to replicate in Europe the successful strategy we have employed in the U.S. in our Memphis lab, greatly enhancing our reach and service levels across Europe. It will also enable scale economies and other operating efficiencies.","We were in a controlled launch in the fourth quarter to ensure smooth operations and a superior customer experience. Our operational quality and customer service expectations were achieved in the fourth quarter, and as a result we have now moved into full launch in the first quarter, accepting and processing samples from a number of countries across Europe. This is one of several key initiatives in 2012 that strengthened our lab business and positions us well for 2013 and beyond.","For 2013, we are projecting organic growth of 8% to 10% for labs and consulting services. This acceleration in growth will be driven by a step-up in growth from both volume and price. Volume growth will come from continued focus on our core strategies.","First, coverage; that is increasing our footprint, including the ramp in volume from the four labs added to our network in 2012. Second, content; which encompasses expanding our specialty test menu and continued penetration of recent introductions such as allergy. And third, connectivity; as enabled by VetConnect and VetConnect PLUS, to both, gain new customers and enhance loyalty of existing customers.","We expect improved price realization as we move forward the timing of annual list price increases and anniversary the ramp in late 2011 and early 2012 of instrument lab bundle marketing programs, with their associated accounting treatment that negatively impacted lab revenue. Our Practice Management and Digital Imaging systems business with revenues of $22.7 million grew 4% organically in the fourth quarter to yield full year growth of 11%.","Performance was a bit light from our expectation at the time of our third quarter call of low-to-mid teen organic growth, primarily from lower digital systems placement due to timing of orders within the quarter. We had a strong book of orders in December, but the lead time for installation are longer in this business, and so we are entering 2013 with a healthy backlog and good momentum and some newer sales reps come down the learning curve. Our Practice Management Systems business continues to grow in the mid-teens driven by Cornerstone, which was the latest software released is fully integrated with VetConnect PLUS and Pet Health Network Pro.","Looking to 2013, we expect to achieve mid-teen organic growth for the year in this business. Factors contributing to this accelerated growth include the recent launch of Cornerstone 8.3, the full commercial launch of Pet Health Network Pro in the first quarter and our partnership with the American Animal Hospital Association announced late in November to advance the Client-centric Animal Hospital with tools that includes Cornerstone and Pet Health Network Pro. In addition, the recent acquisition of DVMAX Practice Management Software will provide cross-selling opportunities for the loyal base of approximately 1,200 practice subscribers.","Livestock and Poultry Diagnostic revenues of $22.6 million declined organically 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, pretty much in line with our expectations at the time of our third quarter call. To remind, the principal drive for this performance is lower testing of cattle in Europe due to reductions in government spending, as some highly successful eradication programs come to end of life.","Secondary contributors are lower swine testing in the U.S. due to drought, and new products ramping up a bit more slowly than originally anticipated. Beginning in 2013, we will be combining our dairy line of business, which represents about 2% of our total company revenues with our livestock and poultry line of business. We are combining the management of these businesses, because of market synergies between the product lines as well as operational efficiencies we achieve.","Through 2012, our dairy financial results were included in this segment labeled other, along with our Opti Medical human point-of-care diagnostics and our remaining pharmaceutical products and out licensing arrangements. For 2013, we expect revenues for the combined livestock, poultry and dairy business to decline organically in the low-to-mid single digits with flat to slightly negative growth for the livestock and poultry lines as we have reported historically.","For livestock and poultry, we anticipate further declines in government testing programs that will be partially offset by higher growth from new products as they continue their adoption ramp. Dairy is expected to decline roughly 10% due to a difficult comparison to high testing in early 2012 in China for milk packs and operate that subsided over the course of the year.","Our water business had sales of $20.9 million for the quarter or 5% organic growth reflecting contributions from our core Colilert testing business, particularly in the Americas. We expect growth for water in 2013 to again be in the mid-single digit range, driven by continued market penetration from recently launched products as well as geographic expansion from regulatory approvals.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin at 53% was largely consistent with our expectations. Operating expenses at 33% of revenue or somewhat below our thinking in October, reflecting the $3.5 million milestone payment, which is netted against operating expenses on the G&A line as well as somewhat lower spending. Operating expenses normalized from the milestone payment were 34% of revenues.","Our effective tax rate of 31.3% was in line with our expectations. As I will touch on further momentarily, the benefit of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 will be recognized in 2013, as the measure was approved in 2013.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $224 million of cash and $215 million of debt, for a net cash position of $9 million. Our inventory balance of $141 million was $6 million lower than at the end of the third quarter as anticipated, the results of solid instrument placements. DSO at 40 days remains very consistent and healthy metric. Our free cash flow was $59 million or 136% of net income. Free cash flow for the year was 104% of net income.","Now as we look forward to 2013, we project revenues to be approximately $1.405 billion to $1.42 billion. Our revenue guidance implies reported growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%, which translates to organic growth of 8% to 9%, as favorable impacts of currency and acquisitions together contribute approximately 50 basis points.","Organic growth of 8% to 9% compared to 7% achieved in 2012. I'd discuss growth progress by business area, but to summarize at a total company levels, growth acceleration can be categorized by two primary themes. First, price realization; from changes in distributor margins in the U.S. and internationally, moving to a direct sales model in the Nordic countries, reduced headwind from marketing programs that have reached steady state, and timing and impact of list price increases.","Second, growth from recent commercial investments and product, and service innovations, including Pet Health Network Pro, VetConnect PLUS, the core lab in Germany and expanded reach into the bioresearch market. Bioresearch revenue growth is anticipated from both, expanding geographically and augmenting our operating to address not only send-out testing performed at the reference lab, but also the market point of care needs with our vet lab platform. We expect organic growth to accelerate sequentially throughout 2013, as commercial initiatives and product and service innovations gain increasing traction.","Additionally, the first quarter faces a difficult comparison for livestock, poultry and dairy as I just described, as well as for companion animal product and service lines, given the mild winter last year that manifested in relatively higher clinic traffic. Accordingly, we anticipate first quarter organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit. We expect full year growth margins to be approximately 54%, roughly in line with our full year 2012 rate.","While targeted initiatives in our two largest businesses, VetLab and reference laboratories will continue to generate margin expansion. The impact of these initiatives will be muted by headwind to the tune of about 50 basis points from 2012 currency hedge gains that are not projected to recur in 2013.","Operating expenses should average out to be in the range of 34% with a quarterly profile that is highest as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter due to commercial activities such as tradeshows and sales meetings. We expect operating margin to be between 19.5% and 20%, which would yield operating margin expansion of roughly 50 basis points when you normalize for the pharma milestone payment in 2012 and impacts of FX. As I just stated, this margin expansion is occurring at the gross margin line.","We expect the tax rate to be between 30% and 30.5% for the full year. The decrease in the tax rate relative to 2012 is the result of the recent expansion of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013, which we expect to lower our 2013 tax rate by almost 200 basis points. The full effect of the extension for both years will be recognized in 2013, with the 2012 credit recognized in total in the first quarter and the 2013 benefit recognized ratably over the year.","Net interest expense is expected to be about $2.5 million and weighted average share count is expected to be down 2% to 2.5% from full year 2012 levels. All of this leads us to raise our full year earnings per share guidance to $3.47 to $3.57, up $0.10 from $3.37 to $3.47 that we guided to in our October call, primarily due to the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which is expected to be $0.04 to $0.05 for each of 2012 and 2013 for a total impact of $0.08 to $0.10.","We are also increasing the low end of our range by a couple of pennies to reflect our increased confidence in the dynamics of the business. Earnings per share growth for 2013 when normalized for hedge gains and pharma payments in 2012 and the 2012 R&D tax credit recognized in 2013 is projected to be 10% to 13%.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to John for further comments on the business.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you, Merilee. As you can tell, we're very pleased with the fundamentals of the business and the growth rate of the core annuity revenue streams ensuring most of our profit. I want to touch lightly on a couple of things before we open it up to Q&A.","First, I'd comment on the VetLab instrument and reagent business performance, which investors know as a razor and blade business model. While we realized lower instrument revenues than expected in Q4, the number in quality placements was strong, specifically considering the increase in competitive Catalyst placements from 40% to nearly 50% and the size of accounts that we upgraded.","In addition, we're seeing even higher growth in consumable usage from customers who upgrade from VetTest to Catalyst than we have seen in the past. Our more recent placement show increased testing in the neighborhood to 20% to 25%, as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-clinic lab with Catalyst and ProCyte, 5 points higher than what we saw for customers upgrading in prior years.","Clearly, real-time care works for our customers and for IDEXX, as they are running more in-house diagnostics for IDEXX's new product. This is because in part our instruments, both Catalyst and our hematology units are designed for just this goal, as they have superior workflow, a more complete test menu and much shorter turnaround time than anything else from the market.","We continue to see impressive loyalty of our Catalyst customers, greater than 99% in 2012. In fact, even with a significantly higher installed base, we have roughly half the number of catalyst losses in 2012 to 2011. Once a customer experiences our in-house lab, including a Catalyst and our hematology offerings, they don't ever want to go backwards.","I'll remind investors that our two hematology offerings consisting of ProCyte Dx and the new LaserCyte Dx remain in a class of their own. Even after 10 years, no other company has managed to introduce the gold standard of laser flow cytometry and a benchtop hematology offering. The only technology that gives complete results and yet we provided a choice of two systems to customers.","The net result of our instrument placements and this extraordinary loyalty is accelerating consumable growth in 2012 over 2011 as well as over the course of 2012. Q4 had 13% instrument consumables growth normalized for U.S. distributor inventory changes, up from the 9% in the first three quarters. Importantly, this 10% revenue growth for all of 2012 was driven more than entirely by consumable unit and volume growth, which is offset by a small amount of negative unit price realization.","We believe this double-digit unit growth for the year bodes well for our outlook in 2013 of 11% to 13% consumable revenue growth in the following way: we expect to realize unit volume growth similar to 2012, i.e., greater than 10% for all the reasons we said so in 2012 and have very modest price realization in 2013 as a result to the evolution of our pricing strategies.","As investors know, a sustainable on growing the annuity of consumables is the important profit driver in the instrument and consumables business, and unit volume growth is the most strategic goal. This unit volume growth is also a core validation effect that our customers are using our instruments to deliver increased diagnostic testing real time, solely increasing the percentage of chemistry and hematology run at the point of care.","In 2013, we expect to further extend our transformation of the veterinarian's diagnostic experience through the continued customer adoption of VetConnect PLUS, our cloud-based service that allows the veterinarian to view results in a completely new insightful, interactive and intuitive way.","We are moving from paper to mobile with all the attendant benefits. You might consider what is happening to the print media industry as a good analogy for this transformation that we are bringing to diagnostic information.","As of today, we've reached 4,500 VetConnect PLUS activations in the U.S., almost double the number we had three months ago. In addition, our sales organization is wanting more and more, how to use this transformational service, which comes free as part of our IDEXX diagnostic offerings to win new accounts for both in-house equipment placements and reference lab services.","Note that, at this time, more of our customers use only one of the two-halves of our diagnostic offering, that is in-house instruments and reference labs, and not including our rapid assay offering, then use both together. So the opportunity for cross-selling IDEXX's diagnostics with VetConnect PLUS is high.","One interesting result of VetConnect PLUS is the increasing customer loyalty in our reference lab that comes from practices, who have activated the new service. As you know, we launched VetConnect PLUS back in July. We are accumulating data on the impact of customer loyalty. And while there is still very early days, we see a clear trend that customers on VetConnect PLUS seem to me more loyal than those not on it, enough to increase customer retention somewhere in the range of 2% to 4%. All other things being equal, that would result in a 2% to 4% increase in the revenue growth from the cohort of practices that have adopted this service.","Of course, we're still somewhat early in the adoption phase with our reference lab customer base, even with 4,500 practices, note, some of which only use our in-house equipment right now, but we have plans to approach a 100% adoption in the U.S. in 2013. This increased loyalty trend helps provide us confidence in our outlook for 8% to 10% growth in the global reference lab line of diagnostics in 2013.","Our goal in 2013 for our North American sales and distribution organization is to continue to grow our effectiveness and communicating the transformational value of VetConnect PLUS to all of our customers, both those who use in-house reference lab or both, both in terms of advanced medical insight and as a tool to demonstrate value to the pet owner.","Ultimately, this value will help vets appropriately increase their use of diagnostic testing with sick pets, those with chronic conditions and in a growing category of preventive care. We also plan to launch VetConnect PLUS to some important international markets in 2013.","We are also pleased to be able to launch the commercial marketing of Pet Health Network Pro at the recent North American Veterinary Conference. This is our cloud based subscription service that helps practices engage clients before, during, and after the visit, to increase the veterinarians' relevance in the pet owner's life and to increase visits and income per visit.","So far we have had hundreds of customers signed up. The large majority are actively using the system as an advance data, before we go to full production later this quarter. We are pleased to see the extraordinary response to the North American Veterinary Conference with crowds around the booth during most of the show.","Pet Health Network Pro benefits IDEXX in multiple ways. First, it generates a revenue stream from subscriptions and consumables, such as reminder cards sent by traditional mail. Second, it will grow visits and the usage of diagnostics as it shares information back and forth with IDEXX's other software products such as Cornerstone and VetConnect PLUS. Third, it gives us yet another cross-selling opportunity across the entire IDEXX product offering by the Companion Animal Group.","In summary, we have a clear roadmap for organic growth of 8% to 9% in 2013 and consequent bottomline growth, in the way that position us well for the years beyond 2013.","So at this point in time, I'd like to open up the call for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","The first one from me, I was just curious on the reagent rental program, is that just for Catalyst Dx? And then secondly, do you expect the counts with the reagent rental agreements to generate higher consumables compared to accounts buying instruments?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes, that's exactly right. They're really for higher volume accounts.","Merilee Raines","And I would say that that also is true for the first part of your question, David, that generally the reagent rental programs work that from both the customer perspective and our perspective, when there are higher consumable usage accounts. So whether that would be high VetTest or Catalyst that would be the case, but primarily we are seeing success with this with Catalyst.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","I guess what I'm trying to ask is, are you setting the bar a little bit higher in terms of the consumable agreement with these accounts, so that they're expected to actually use a little bit more?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes, exactly. You are exactly right, David.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","And then for the 8% to 10% reference lab growth target, what are your expectations from volume versus price in there? And should we expect additional lab openings during the year?","Merilee Raines","The breakout between price and volume is probably about, 70% of that growth would be due to volume and about 30% for price.","Jonathan Ayers","And we have a couple of lab openings, but I think the primary growth driver is going to be leveraging our whole network of 60 plus labs and the hub. And the other driver of growth is a growth in our, specialty testing, which generally speaking new categories of testing that that can't be run in-house and uniquely accrue to the benefit of the reference lab.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair","It's Kristina Blaschek for Ryan today. To start, on the change in distributor margin from MWI, have you thought about how that will be reinvested. I assume some of it will be OUS with the Scandinavian opportunities, anything domestic though that you thought about specifically?","Jonathan Ayers","I'll tell you, it's kind of hard to allocate here or there. We continue with an appropriate and aggressive investment in our commercial organizations, whether they'd be at sales, support. We have couple of dozen people who supports specifically our distribution, as well as other elements of the marketing mix. So I think we're very comfortable with that mix. And it was really a modest change.","Referring to the Scandinavian situation, what we're doing there is going directly. Obviously, we have a number of customers who use our equipment today. The distributor that we had wasn't very effective in placing new instruments and we think that's a very attractive market. And so with direct, we think we'll be in a much better position to place our instruments, which are well designed for the Scandinavian markets. It's an excellent match. But of course, we get the up lift from going from distribution in 2012 to direct in 2013.","So yes we are investing in commercial resources in Scandinavia to go direct, although we're already leveraging our warehouse and distribution network because we're direct in the other countries and Europe. But that is in essence, being more than paid for by the pickup in the margin in those same countries.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair","And then I guess, staying under distributor topic, at NAVC this year, it seemed like the two large exclusive distributors were more engaged than in the past, with Henry Schein even commenting, they were much more active in attempting to place IDEXX analyzers OUS. Can you share with us your view on how these relationships have improved since going through this distribution few last years?","Jonathan Ayers","We're really pleased with the relationships that we have with our U.S. distribution and I think one of the hallmarks of IDEXX is that over two decades of having work with distribution we're continuing to learn how to make that partnership stronger and stronger.","And so we're pleased with the engagement of our exclusive distributors that you mentioned in an increase level of engagement. And we're also pleased with the continued high level of engagement of MWI, which remains an important partner for us. So distribution is an important element that supplements, of course, our direct sales organization.","In the U.S. market, they work hand in glove. And we're very pleased with where things are as we move to 2013. And the ability of this entire, our commercial organization to communicate the benefits of the transformation of value of that our diagnostics provide. And as I mentioned in the call, I think it's kind of important, when people make that transition, they just realize they never want to go back, because, they've kind of asked us, so who should've been doing this all along.","And so our challenge is really to bring people to that point across the market. And with our direct sales and our distribution engagement that we have now and they're pretty excited about things like VetConnect PLUS and the product line. We're thinking we're in a good position to do so.","Operator","Next, we will go to line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","I guess, can you just speak to what you're seeing as far as the competitive dynamics on the reference laboratory front, and I guess domestic market? But also, can you speak to the dynamics internationally?","Jonathan Ayers","In the competitive situation in the U.S. is different than international. And every country is a little bit different. We are really not seeing any change, and what I would characterize is historically been a very competitive market that we participate in U.S. and indeed all of North America. It's really the same level of competition.","I think what we're excited about as we're bringing a new wave of innovation, on top of things like the specialized testing and the expansion of our coverage, of our lab network in North America, this new way of innovation really driven by VetConnect PLUS. And just as, I said a different way to see the value, and have much higher value in the usage of diagnostic information in the clinics, so that's really the biggest change we're seeing is what we're brining to the market.","None of our competitor's in North America are competitors. Outside of North America, it's usually a country-specific competitors, in rare cases may move across a couple of countries. For example, we're really only reference lab network in Europe that's across the continent level, and then in the U.K. and of course, leveraging our global scale and capability. And the same is true in Australia, and in Japan, just a very different local competitive environment.","So we're excited about it, because we can bring innovations that really come out of our global investment reference lab. And they might be in specialized testing, in advanced lab technologies and LIMS, which is our new Laboratory Information Management System that we're over the course of several years rolling out through the global lab business, internally developed system that we put over $10 million investment in.","And very pleased by the way to be able to say that we've launched our first lab in the U.S. under LIMS after having successfully rolled linked out to our four labs in the U.K., and our four labs in Australia. So that rollout will continue and the U.S. of course is a pretty big opportunity to get a significant ROI in the LIMS investment. So we can bring those types of scale benefits internationally, and we're dealing really with local competition.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","And then how do you expect, I guess, VetConnect PLUS to ultimately impact reference laboratory retention longer-term? And I guess I understand how VetConnect PLUS links to equipment and the reference lab results, but what happens when for instance its rapid assay test when it's not used with the SNAPshot reader. I mean, it seems like maybe that would be a little bit more vulnerable to competition.","Jonathan Ayers","First of all, we really do think that VetConnect PLUS will be transformational in the way that diagnostic results are viewed and used. It's kind of the move to digital media from print media would be the analogy there. Right now, of course, it applies quite relevantly to the reference lab offering and to the in-house instrument offering. We do have a couple of different ways that rapid assay results can be entered into VetConnect Plus through SNAPshot as you mentioned or also directly through IDEXX VetLab station.","One of the benefits of doing so is now VetConnect PLUS has what we call client-friendly reports, and in the case of our rapid assay business, preventative screening used in 4Dx for parasitic disease screening, the VetConnect PLUS can generate report that congratulate the customer on having protected their pet from vector-borne diseases, which gives a lot more of value to that 4Dx comprehensive test.","I'm just saying there wasn't any negative result. And that's all integrated into VetConnect PLUS. As one of the benefits, but clearly as we look forward, we're going to be looking for ways to continue to leverage VetConnect PLUS as a way of communicating and disseminating diagnostic information and rapid assay included, Erin.","Operator","We'll go the line of Ross Taylor from CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King","Wanted to go back to the instruments and the reagent rental program, what factors led you to adopt that program now? And I guess related to that intuitively I would think that larger clinics, you will be better able to afford than just an outright purchase of the instrument. I mean, why is that you're proving to be popular with the larger clinics at this point? Is Catalyst is just getting more mature or fully penetrated since been in the marketplace for about five years now?","Jonathan Ayers","Well, I think we've been very successful in placing Catalyst in larger accounts since we launched it in 2008. And as you know we had launch, what we called the in-house protocol agreement, the IPA, about year and a half ago. And so we're continuing to find ways to move these larger accounts to the IDEXX diagnostic advantage, and with in-house equipment.","And I think what we found was that every accounts will differ, they all will have different needs, they all will have different way of thinking. Many accounts do want to purchase the equipment. And there are programs that are beneficial to them, that place equipment, and there are other accounts that are more interested in this type of arrangement.","The economics are actually not different, although the revenue recognition will be little bit different, but the economics and the cash flow, isn't really that different between different types of programs. But we just found that there is a segment of the market that this works.","And of course, we really see that any account, certainly a large account, but any account, when they move to Catalyst and ProCyte and they are integrated with the complete solution and VetConnect PLUS, they realize that they just never want to go backward again. And so we're just finding ways to be able to bring them to that solution. We found that for a segment of customers, a minority of customers that this happens to be an effective tool.","Ross Taylor - CL King","And if I can just squeeze in a second question, the 2% impact you mentioned for the reference labs of Hurricane Sandy and the holidays. Can you quantify how much you might be due to each one of those?","Merilee Raines","About maybe 0.5% was due to Sandy and about a 1.5% would be due to the timing of the holidays.","Ross Taylor - CL King","With Christmas, and New Years falling on a Tuesday that's the toughest calendarization of the calendar cycle?","Merilee Raines","Going from a weekend to the middle of the week, basically it's a challenge.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel Nicolaus.","Jonathan Block - Stifel Nicolaus","Maybe the first one just on the instrument placement, I think Merilee you said about 3% for the year for 2012 and expectations for low single digits in 2013. It seems like you lowered the bar a little bit by the consumable reagent program. So can you talk to just market share?","And I know John, you're going to say, well, it's about where the box goes and I realize that but your chief competitor on the point-of-care side has been placing instruments closer to about 7% to 9%. You guys have decelerated and instilled steady it about 2% to 3%. Can you just talk to the dynamics of box placements with market share going forward?","Jonathan Ayers","We are a global business. So there a lot of moving parts there, John, but the purpose of placing the box is to generate the consumables. And that's where the profit driver is, and razor and blade of business model. And our objective is to find the ways to grow. And in fact accelerate, as we've seen that consumable revenue. And we're very pleased with what we're seeing over the course of 2012 with the accelerating volume.","And as I mentioned, unit volumes is even higher than the revenue. In 2012, we think that will equalize volume and revenue in 2013, which will help to drive to 11% to 13% growth. So I mean, if you look at the 11% to 13% growth in the profit driver, which is three quarters of the business, we think that compares favorably with the market growth.","Jonathan Block - Stifel Nicolaus","Maybe just one or two more, if I can fit it in. The first one, Merilee, you mentioned a lot of areas where you might be able to realize price in '13. John, you just alluded to the consumables, the Scandinavian going market going directs, some price at the lab, but your gross margin guidance, I think of 54% would be flat in '13, flat versus '12. So can you talk to sort of where you're giving back in the COGS, if you're able realize a lot more price in '13 than '12?","Merilee Raines","We again, currency and the impact of hedge gains this year that we do not project would reoccur in 2013, create quite a bit of headwind. In fact, gross margin expansion that would be about 50 basis points, if you were to normalize for that. So we are expecting gross margin expansion and some price as a piece of that, as well as manufacturing efficiencies, and just really volume leverage and other things that we've been driving, and again, primarily our reference lab and our VetLab business. So those kind of recurring things we still see that manifesting, and we expect to see that manifesting continued margin expansion in 2013.","Jonathan Ayers","And that's a little bit offset by some of the areas that we're investing and that will generate attractive revenue streams in the future of such as Pet Health Network Pro and the expansion of bioresearch with our point-of-care of instruments and associated consumables. Those are going to be little bit negative, and those will be unfavorable to the gross margin in terms of mix as they pick up in the near term, but attractive in the long-term.","Jonathan Block - Stifel Nicolaus","Maybe one last one, wasn't able to ask in 3Q '12, so I was trying to pull-in forward. Just here we are on the first month of the year and distribution has changed, John, and I understand NWI is still a very important partner. But anything you've seen in the first 30 days, now that we're in sort of the new regime or different dynamic that you can speak to? And I'm guessing, you really don't expect much of any impact, because if you isolate your rapid assay growth of 4% to 6% for '13, that's the line, I don't know, might be most vulnerable? So do you really expect little to no noise in the distribution front?","Jonathan Ayers","I'll tell you, we're very pleased with our engagement. And just returning to the rapid assay business, these are very unique, valuable combination assays. The 4Dx Plus, which of course, by far, the largest product line in the rapid assay business test for six different vector-borne diseases that are prevalent in test. And it's the gold standard. We have a lot of benefits. We can easily distinguish, in many cases, between a vaccinated animal and an infected animal, which is unique to that assay. And it's easy-to-use, people know it.","And there is just nothing else that compares on the market. So I think the strength of our products, which particularly in the rapid assay side, speaks well for our position. And of course, we're continuing to innovate in the rapid assay line. And have a pipeline in the rapid assay line, as we do in our other lines. So we're never standing still.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James and Associates.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","On the rental reagent agreements, did you get higher margins on the consumables under the new relative to, let's say, if they were associated under the old methodology?","Merilee Raines","I really think this is more about the utilization. It's not so much about a higher margin. What we really have found is that with particularly, as we've now focused on customers' that are new to IDEXX and that's been an increasing focus for us, we found that there are plenty of high-test users out there.","And because they are very confident about their consumable usage that this type of program, they feel very comfortable with it because they are already very confident about their consumable usage, so this is about high-volume users and really appealing. And, again, different things appeal to different customers, but this particularly resonates in some cases with some of these higher volume clinics.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Then speaking of Pet Health Network Pro, what do you guys have embedded in terms of your expectations for '13 for revenue growth? Certainly it's falling more of a longer-term revenue opportunity, but just trying to sense of how many customers do you think you could add on this year, vis-\u00e0-vis competition or on your market growth?","Jonathan Ayers","We do have very specific plans in that area. For competitive reasons, won't go into much detail, but it is a contributor to our accelerated revenue growth. And I would mention with the Pet Health Network Pro, that these are annuity revenues. It's different than the instrument business where in the good majority of the cases. Even with the reagent rental program, you get the instrument revenue upfront and then you get the consumables after this. This is just the consumables business.","So in other words, annuity business that comes from the subscription and the usage of traditional mail, which generates incremental revenue. So it's growing, I think it will be a new revenue stream in 2013. And it will be one which we'll build nicely in an annuity fashion in the years to come.","We're very excited with the market response to Pet Health Network Pro. And really just had an unbelievable show at the North American Veterinary Conference, and of course, we're very pleased that the American Animal Hospital Association, which has tremendous credibility with 5,000 more sophisticated practices gave the exclusive endorsement for Pet Health Network Pro combined with Cornerstone as the way to take it to the next step in practice management. So we think we're well positioned to achieve our objectives in 2013 with Pet Health Network Pro.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","And Merilee, if I can may, just maybe the 1Q tax rate, considering it's going to include the 2012 R&D portion, I know you gave us the full year but 1Q would be helpful?","Merilee Raines","Let's say, that probably more talking about something in the neighborhood of 27% or something by nature.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Tax rate?","Merilee Raines","Tax rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","You mentioned the instrument organic growth was impacted by about 8% due to the reagent rental program. Could you quantify the impact to the consumable organic growth during Q4?","Jonathan Ayers","I would say it really didn't have much of an impact, because generally those instruments are placed over the course of the quarter. Usually, it's a little bit more towards the end of the quarter. So not really, I would think any noticeable material impact in Q4. Really the impact will be in the quarters to come.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","And then, do you expect differential reference lab growth rates outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. in 2013?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes. We're expecting a growth in all of our reference labs in every single country market or region that we participate in, and they all will contribute to the growth. There are very different economies and different situations in each economy, and we generally don't go through each one, one-by-one. But for instance, in Europe, we have a new (licensing) opening which will really help the continental Europe.","We have good momentum in our other markets, whether it would be U.K., Canada, Australia, or Japan, and of course, we're really excited about the U.S. because U.S. is the first beneficiary, the benefits of VetConnect PLUS in terms of the transformational way to experience and use diagnostics in practice. So all the regions will contribute to growth.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jeff Frelick with Canaccord.","Jeff Frelick - Canaccord","Did you say the reagent rental program you are able to combine hematology with chemistry? And then should we also assume in general, the reagent renal program, the business should be little bit more sticky, given the five-year contracts that you're engaged?","Merilee Raines","The program is really mostly geared towards chemistry. I don't know, there may have been a hematology or two, that was placed along with that but it primarily is geared at the chemistry market.","Jonathan Ayers","I wouldn't say just to the answer of stickiness, it's hard to get stickier than plus 99%. And so I think our instrument line is already amazingly sticky. And so this is not going to really change that, I don't think. I think it will continue to be amazingly sticky, not just because of the regional rental but because of the value that people see in these instruments and bring in to their practice. And the capabilities that once they start using, they appreciate and that are unique to the IDEXX offering.","And that really runs across so many different dimensions, whether it's the speed of the instruments and being able to deliver the results inside an appointment, to the far more complete menu to the menu-flexibility, to the ease-of-use, to integration and to practice management software, and of course the benefits of VetConnect PLUS. So the list goes on. And I think people once they experience that they really don't want to lose any of that. And that's why these are so sticky.","Jeff Frelick - Canaccord","Just a quick follow-up to that then, John, the success you had with the Catalyst and you had said about I guess an excess of 60% had been into competitive accounts. What was the practice doing previously for chemistry, were they using a competitive in-house instrument or they're sending out to reference labs?","Jonathan Ayers","In terms of Catalyst placements, I think we said a nearly 50%.","Merilee Raines","That was the combined Catalyst and VetTest with 60% to new accounts, just to clarify.","Jonathan Ayers","So with the VetTest, we're are still placing a lot of VetTest in emerging markets, and even some markets you would consider established markets or emerging markets from a veterinary perspective. And so a lot of that is new instruments, where the practice is adding the instrument for the first time. But you know, with regard to Catalyst placement nearly 50% which is up from the 40% in the first three quarters of the year, and 30% really last year, so nice tickup.","That's really going into accounts that have existing mostly, accounts that have some kind of existing analyzer that doesn't provide the same capability Catalyst, that's why they upgrade the Catalyst. And in minority cases its new practices. There are some practices out there, it's true. Not too many, but some of that that don't have in-house instrumentation. But that's more rare than customers who are using exclusively or primarily another analyzer not from IDEXX. And they decide to upgrade to the IDEXX diagnostic advantage.","Operator","Thank you. And with that Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan Ayers","Well, thank you very much everybody for listening in the call. And I want to congratulate the IDEXX team for all of our successes in 2012 and the momentum that we've established going into 2013. And we look forward to updating investors at our first quarter call as we continue to achieve our strategic objectives over the course of 2013. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one, with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you and good morning everyone. IDEXX's strong business momentum continued in Q1, driving excellent financial results. In terms of highlights, Q1 revenues were $462 million, reflecting organic growth of 11%, at the high-end of our expectations, supported by very strong 14% organic gains in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues.","CAG recurring revenue gains reflected strong global growth across major modalities, including 15% consumable growth, 13% lab gains and 11% organic growth in rapid assay. We also delivered another strong quarter in terms of expanding our instrument base, with 2,340 premium analyzers placed globally, up 18% from prior year levels.","Strong top line growth, better than expected operating margin performance, and $0.12 per share in benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to tax benefits from share-based compensation, supported Q1 EPS of $0.77 per share or an increase of 53% on a constant dollar basis.","Further adjusting for the impact of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance, comparable constant currency EPS growth was 29%.","Reflecting our continued strong business trends, we're raising our full-year organic growth guidance by 0.5%, to 9.5% to 11%. Along with updated estimates for foreign exchange rates, which improved since our last call, this results in a reported revenue range of $1.925 billion to $1.950 billion for 2017, an increase of $15 million compared to our original guidance.","We're increasing our EPS range by $0.10, to $2.95 to $3.11 per share, reflecting higher estimates for 2017 benefits associated with adoption of accounting guidance related to tax benefits from share-based compensation.","Operating profit upside from our higher revenue outlook will be offset by incremental planned investments in our U.S. commercial capability, U.S. lab capacity and R&D, aligned with the significant opportunity we see to build on strong CAG growth trends and continue to deliver against our long-term goals for 10% plus overall annual organic revenue growth.","We'll manage these investments while delivering a targeted 75 to 100 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins, at the higher end of our long-term goals.","These operating profit benefits will be offset by a $0.05 per share headwind related to expectations for relatively higher average effective tax rate, excluding share compensation accounting impacts, driven by strong profit growth in the U.S.","We'll review our updated 2017 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region.","We achieved continued strong organic growth in both U.S. and international regions in the first quarter, driven by our CAG business. U.S. revenues were $289 million in the quarter, up 11% organically. Gains reflected continued strong premium instrument placements and 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.","U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by strong double-digit growth in consumables and reference labs, as well as a very solid quarter for rapid assay sales, driven by our growing 4Dx franchise. U.S. recurring gains continue to be primarily volume driven, supported by ongoing improvement in customer retention trends across modalities. We also achieved a relatively stronger 3% level of average net price improvement in Q1 benefiting from timing and year-on-year comparisons of promotional programs.","For the full year 2017, we're maintaining an outlook for solid average CAG Diagnostics recurring pricing gains in the 2% to 3% range in the U.S., augmenting strong volume trends. IDEXX's performance continued to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth in Q1, reflected in our data set from about 5,000 clinics.","In Q1 on a same store basis, patient visits increased 0.7% and clinic revenues increased 4.6% compared to very strong prior year Q1 clinic revenue gains of 9% or a two year average of 6.8%, very much in line with recent trends.","International revenues in Q1 were $173 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 17% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues reflecting continued very strong consumable revenue gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base and significant gains in average testing utilization. We also continued to see solid double-digit organic lab revenue gains in our international markets supported by very positive customer response to SDMA, as well as double-digit growth in rapid assay sales. Overall international revenue gains were moderated by year-on-year declines in our international LPD business, impacted by lower levels of herd health screening for Asia cattle exports.","Turning to segment performance, our Q1 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostics testing modalities and continued momentum in expanding our premium instrument base. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $26 million, up 17% organically, supported by 18% growth in premium Instrument placements. Strong year-on-year instrument revenue growth was driven by SediVue, including benefits from our SediVue international launch in select markets.","Globally, we placed 1,131 Catalysts, 822 premium hematology analyzers, and 387 SediVues in the first quarter. Global Catalyst placements were in line with very strong prior year Q1 levels supported by ongoing international momentum and high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America. Placement momentum supported continued global expansion of our Catalyst base which is driving accelerated consumable growth.","Globally, our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 22% year-on-year in Q1 reflecting 11% year-on-year growth in the U.S. and 36% year-on-year gains in international markets. In North America, we placed 388 Catalysts in Q1 with 304 or 78%, at competitive or greenfield accounts. Overall North America Catalyst placements in the prior year first quarter included 131 second Catalyst placements as part of our successful customer retention program compared to 59 second Catalyst placements in Q1 of 2017.","Adjusting for second Catalysts, year-on-year Catalyst placements grew solidly in North America, supported by 18% gains in competitive placements. Consistent with our economic value focus and our sales compensation approach, we also saw excellent results in the placement of SediVue and SNAP Pros in North America.","Strong customer response to our new ProRead capability supported the placement of 1,041 SNAP Pros in North America in Q1, our strongest quarterly performance since the SNAP Pro launch in 2014. The combined impact of accelerating customer penetration and the beneficial network effect of integration across our offerings sets the stage for continued strong recurring revenue growth and very high customer retention.","Benefits from IDEXX innovation and enhanced commercial capability continue to drive very strong recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. In Q1, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were $347 million, up 14% organically. Reference laboratory and consulting services, with revenues of $159 million, grew 13% organically in the first quarter supported by double-digit organic gains in both U.S. and international markets compared to very strong 15% organic growth in Q1 of 2016. Please note that our organic growth metrics do not include adjustments for the number of equivalent days in the quarter.","Instrument consumable revenues of $124 million in Q1 grew 15% organically supported by continued 20% organic gains in international markets and strong double-digit growth in the U.S. including building benefits from the expansion of SediVue. Overall, SediVue contributed 1.6% to global consumable gains in the quarter.","Rapid assay revenues increased 11% organically in Q1 to $48 million supported by continued solid volume gains in SNAP 4Dx Plus, strong growth in specialty rapid assays, stabilized volume trend in first generation products as well as solid net price improvement, including favorable year-on-year comparisons in Q1 related to U.S. promotional programs which supported both higher price and volume realization in Q1.","We're targeting mid-single digit organic growth in rapid assay revenues for the balance of 2017. Please note that these results do not include revenues from SNAP Pro placements which are captured in instrument revenues.","Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues were $30 million in the quarter, up 4% organically. Solid VSS gains were driven by continued penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base, moderated by lower instrument placement revenue as we transition to a recurring cloud-based service model. Diagnostic imaging system revenues also increased solidly supported by growth in digital radiography placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform.","Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues of $29 million declined 5% organically in Q1. Results were pressured by lower levels of herd health screening of Australian and New Zealand dairy cattle for export to China. This is a relatively small business for us, which can be subject to more volatility based on local market conditions.","Excluding herd health screening impacts, LPD revenues were flat year-on-year in Q1, as solid gains in recurring core products and double-digit gains in pregnancy testing were offset by pressure on our dairy business, in part related to lower milk pricing globally. As noted on our Q4 call, for 2017, we're targeting flat to modest growth in LPD overall, as we continue to work through pressures from year-on-year comparisons for select product lines.","Our water business revenues grew 7% organically in Q1 to $25 million, up against a strong 11% growth comparison in Q1 of 2016. Performance was supported by continued progress in developing our core U.S. and European markets and strong growth in Asia Pacific. We continue to be on-track to sustain high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q1 was $92 million, up 25% as reported or 28% on a constant currency basis, with the results driven by strong profit gains in our CAG business. Operating margins were 20%, up 260 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid gross margin improvement and significant operating expense leverage.","Excellent Q1 performance puts us on track to deliver constant currency operating margin improvement this year at the higher end of our long-term goal of 50 to 100-basis point annual gains, while we advance investments to sustain our strong organic revenue growth trajectory.","Gross profit was $258 million in Q1, up 13% on a reported basis. Adjusted for foreign exchange impacts, gross margins increased 150 basis points, reflecting solid CAG net price gains and volume leverage from strong consumable and reference lab growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefit gross profit, were about $1 million in Q1.","Operating expenses in Q1 were up 8%, driven primarily by investments in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology capability. Q1 expense growth was lower than projected, reflecting timing of select head count additions. We expect higher levels of operating expense growth for the balance of the year as we advance incremental investments in U.S. commercial capability and towards R&D initiatives which we'll discuss as part of our updated 2017 financial outlook.","EPS in Q1 was $0.77 per share, including $0.12 per share in benefit from adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. Tax benefits from share-based compensation were high in Q1 reflecting a combination of factors, including the significant recent appreciation of our stock price, Q1 vesting of stock option and restricted stock grants, and higher levels of activity in 2017 relating to the expiration of specific stock compensation grants.","For the full-year, we now expect benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share or $0.10 per share higher than our original estimates. Please note that we do not estimate that this higher level of activity will flow through to future periods as we believe that a range of $0.12 to $0.16 per share of annual benefit reflects a reasonable estimate for 2018 and beyond based on our current visibility and analysis, assuming current stock price levels.","Aside from the benefits from the new accounting adoption, Q1 EPS results were supported by continued benefits from share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 0.9%, net of a 0.5% negative impact, related to the adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance.","Our effective tax rate was 18.5% in Q1, including 13.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption. Foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q1 2016 and 2017 lowered operating profit by $2 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter.","Free cash flow was $8 million for 2017 in Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality. We continue to maintain a full year outlook for free cash flow of about 95% of net income, aligned with projected full year capital spending of $90 million.","Our outlook for continued strong free cash flow generation aligned with our very strong business momentum, supports allocation of capital to share repurchases. In Q1 we repurchased 400,000 shares in the open market at an average price of $130 per share, or a deployment of $51 million in cash flow.","We ended Q1 with $1.268 billion in debt outstanding, $400 million in cash and investment balances and $178 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances. We anticipate maintaining gross leverage ratios in the 2.5 times to 3.0 times range in 2017, with continued deployment of excess cash flow toward share repurchases.","Turning to our 2017 outlook, as noted, we're increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance range. We are raising our reported revenue guidance by $15 million to $1.925 billion to $1.950 billion, reflecting a higher expectation for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11% as well as about $5 million of revenue benefits from relatively more favorable FX rate changes.","At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we're now projecting that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by about 1% in 2017 related to year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar. FX changes are projected to reduce 2017 operating profit by about $6 million and EPS by $0.05 a share at the assumed rates net of a projected $6 million or $0.05 per share benefit from previously established hedge positions.","In terms of our operating margin outlook, we're projecting annual improvement on a reported basis of 60 to 85 basis points, which equates to 75 to 100 annual basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. This constant currency outlook is relatively higher than our original guidance and it's at the high end of our long-term annual operating margin improvement goals.","We'll be delivering this strong performance while advancing about $10 million in incremental investment related to expanding our regional customer-facing capability in the U.S., adding capacity to support continued strong U.S. laboratory services growth and advancing our R&D agenda. Jon will talk more about these initiatives in his comments. We see these as very high-return investments aligned with the very strong organic growth potential that we see for our business.","As noted, we're raising our 2017 EPS outlook to $2.95 to $3.11 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share, to reflect benefits from updated estimates for the adoption of the new accounting guidance. While we're expecting $0.03 per share in EPS upsides from flow-through of stronger organic growth expectations, while covering planned incremental investments and $0.02 per share in benefits for an improved FX outlook, these upsides will be offset by the $0.05 per share negative impact related to increase in our underlying effective tax rate.","Regarding the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, on our Q4 call, we had estimated that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 30.5% to 31% prior to these impacts, similar to prior year levels. Given very strong profit growth trends in the U.S., which carry a higher effective tax rate, we are now increasing this estimate for 2017 to 32.0%.","In terms of benefits from reflecting the tax deductibility of share-based compensation in our P&L under the new accounting guidance, we are raising our expected tax rate benefits on this front in 2017 by 2%, to 5.5% to 6.5%. This results in an updated estimate for 2017 full year effective tax rate of 25.5% to 26.5%.","As noted, a portion of this tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors, including the timing of the exercise of options, which are not expected to carry over into future periods. At this stage, we believe an estimate for an effective tax rate of 27.5% to 28.5% is reasonable for years post 2017, based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity. This assumes no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. We'll provide updated estimates on this front later in the year as we share our preliminary guidance for 2018.","Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. As noted, we expect to maintain our gross leverage ratios at 2.5 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA in 2017, resulting in net interest expense of $32 million to $33 million.","In terms of our second quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q2 revenue \u2013 reported revenue growth in the 7% to 8% range reflecting organic gains of 9% to 10%, offset by about 2% of FX headwind.","Keep in mind that we'll be facing some tougher growth comparisons related to the U.S. SediVue instrument launch which will moderate reported instrument revenue gains as well as favorable Easter timing last year. Year-on-year operating margin improvement in Q2 is expected to be flat on a reported basis as we ramp the incremental U.S. commercial investment including impacts from some upfront costs.","And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, please also keep in mind that we will have about 1% of revenue headwind due to year-on-year comparisons in the number of equipment business days. This impact is factored into our updated full-year guidance.","That concludes the financial review. Let me now turn the call over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. We are indeed off to a great start to the year. I note the 14% constant currency growth of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q1 which make up 72% of IDEXXs total revenues and is the core driver of not just revenue but profitability to IDEXX. This growth metric exceeded the 13% we achieved in Q4 2016, which itself was the highest growth quarter of 2016 and we had a strong compare in Q1 of 2016 in the U.S. if investors recall.","We had strength in all global geographies and double-digit growth in all three modalities that contribute to these diagnostic recurring revenues; that is reference labs, instrument consumables, and rapid assay tests. So, a solid start to the year with good momentum, giving us confidence to increase IDEXX's 2017 organic growth guidance by 0.5%, to 9.5% to 11%.","Let me turn to a few operational highlights in the quarter. Our international teams around the world continue to make huge progress placing our franchise Catalyst One chemistry analyzer in all geographies, generating 20% international VetLab consumable growth.","This novel chemistry analyzer is high function and low cost. We believe there exists a long runway for instrument placements internationally. At the end of Q1, our active installed base of Catalysts outside North America has grown cumulatively to over 11,000 instruments and customers. And yet, we believe the potential number of additional customers is roughly five times that amount. And the number of companion animal practices is growing every year, so, many years of growth ahead for us.","In addition, we are seeing very nice double-digit growth in our reference labs in our core markets of Europe, Australia and Japan. In many international markets, SDMA adoption and appreciation has been even quicker than the North American markets. While this is driving reference lab growth, it also bodes well for when we launch SDMA on the Catalyst analyzer in the form of a slide, currently targeted for the end of this year.","Our Companion Animal Group North American sales organization also had a great quarter. During the quarter, our North American team moved to a new compensation approach to reward for instrument placements where we give our sales professionals credit for the economic value of a placement to IDEXX over a multi-year timeframe, which recognizes not only the value of the instrument placement but the recurring revenues that comes from each type of placement and the profitability of those revenues.","I am very pleased that our teams made a nice transition to the new approach. And we saw a 14% jump in field productivity and instrument placement value in Q1 when viewed on an apples-to-apples basis, i.e., based on the economic value of instruments placed in Q1 2017 versus the implied economic value in Q1 of 2016 and adjusting appropriately for SediVue, where last year, we generated orders in Q1 but did not start placements until Q2.","It's great to see this productivity jump as it was the driver of 18% growth in competitive Catalyst placements and very strong placement level for over 1,000 SNAP Pro devices. SNAP Pro placements also benefited from the new software functionality in Q1 that automatically interprets the SNAP. Customers that are actively using their SNAP Pros for their SNAP devices are very loyal to our family of rapid assay tests and these placements are growing that cohort of loyal customers.","While our U.S. commercial teams in the field and those supporting them did a great job with instrument placements, they also continue to drive strong double-digit growth in reference labs growing the market and convincing new accounts to join the IDEXX SDMA revolution. Indeed, our fully direct presence in the U.S. has been so successful that we've made a decision to further augment our field presence. We are expanding our field commercial organization in the second quarter, adding three new regions and a total of over 45 new field-based professionals, growing our field presence by 12% from roughly 390 professionals to over 435.","We're also growing our reference lab capacity to better serve our customers as well as slightly augmenting our R&D investments. Collectively, this $10 million additional investment in 2017 is something we can do and still expand our constant currency operating margins above prior guidance, courtesy of strong accelerated revenue growth.","We know the investments in customer presence, customer experience and innovation in the core U.S. companion animal market has a high ROI. Our recent investments have a clear and proven track record of return in the form of profitable augmented growth in recurring diagnostic revenue.","On the technology front, we've now completed our rollout of the more advanced SediVue algorithmic interpretation software to our installed base of customers, courtesy of the fact they're all connected via SmartService and we've gotten tremendous customer feedback.","The software update that we call Neural Network 2.0 takes a machine learning approach that incorporates over 14 million images that our customers have generated and sent to us via SmartService over the nine months in 2016 that the product had been in the field.","Neural Network 2.0 makes great strides in the instrument's capability but were never done. We continually upgrade our instruments with new software, new capability and occasionally new menu. And SediVue is no exception. There will be even more to come. The reception of SediVue, now with Neural Network 2.0 gives us confidence in our target of over 2,000 SediVue placements globally in 2017.","As I mentioned, we remain on track to launch SDMA on a Catalyst slide by the end of the year which will be huge. And our new SNAP fecal test in mid-2018, which we view as another long-term blockbuster. No question that our pipeline of novel diagnostic tests, systems and software remains robust.","Our strategy is about enduring, profitable growth. People love their pets the world over and want to take care of them. And yet, veterinary services are vastly underutilized, including the all-important diagnostics category, which after all is essential to determining a pet's health status, since pets can't tell you what's wrong.","Our strategy is to work hard to fill the gap between current practice and this potential. This is going to take a long time, years if not decades. The trends are both huge, somewhat tectonic in pace and long-term in nature, driving both long-term secular growth well above the growth of the general economy and profitability for IDEXX. IDEXX is at the tip of the spear in driving this growth with our technology and software solutions and the great teams in markets around the world.","I want to conclude the up-front comments with just a huge thanks to our IDEXX employees across the company and around the world who delivered such a great quarter, and to our customers for their continued confidence in partnering with IDEXX to support their clients with the important bonds we all have with our pets.","So, at this point, we'll open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, one for you. Given the significant OUS opportunities, specifically with instruments that you discussed, can you talk a little bit more about the balance between investing more of the upside into the U.S. customer-facing organization and spending those dollars outside of the U.S.? And then, number two, I'm just curious if any of this is due to competitive actions in the U.S. market, or if it's more just the expected return on investment versus any externalities you're seeing?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. It's a wonderful situation, Ryan, because we really see attractive markets, of course, in the U.S. which is, by the way, two-thirds of global market today, as silly as that seems, for Companion Animal Diagnostics, and great opportunities really around the world.","As you know, in international geographies, over the last several years, we have moved to more and more of a fully direct presence in many countries and roughly 70% of our Companion Animal revenues outside the U.S. are now sold through direct organizations and 30% through hybrid or distribution.","We think at this point we're about at the right mix, but those have been some very significant investments. And now we're seeing the return on those investments. And they're led by \u2013 outside the U.S. They are led by just the exceptional opportunity we have for Catalyst placements and they're \u2013 it's a high growth, and I think we feel comfortable with the growth and investments we're making there.","In the U.S. market, we're just seeing a tremendous response to our innovation portfolio. The U.S. market is a more sophisticated market. But it's shocking, Ryan. We estimate that only 7% of clinical visits, a chemistry panel, just a chemistry panel is run. Only 7%, and yet best practice, evidence-based medicine would suggest that preventive care, including routine wellness testing is really appropriate given we find things.","So, that 7% is just a small fraction of where we think it could be. And the responses we're seeing to things like SDMA or SediVue, or now the incredible response to the SNAP Pro, which is primarily a U.S. market because, of course, it leverages the rapid assay behind, means that the constraint here is more customer presence.","And so, based on the momentum we have in the U.S., we think that augmenting our investments here is going to help us support our 10%-plus organic growth of the company as a whole into future years.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Ryan, I'd just reinforce too. This is an investment that's based on an opportunity and a return from the opportunity. It's not a reaction to other dynamics. As you know, this is our core business. We know it well. And this is what we love to invest in, and when we see the opportunity for incremental growth and incremental return, we very much would like to invest towards that for \u2013 on an ongoing basis.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. It's just \u2013 kind of building on that comment, Ryan. We're not a company that makes a lot of acquisitions. I mean, we make acquisitions when they fit into our core strategy. We're very interested in it, but there's just not that many to do. So, our types of investments we're making are \u2013 they're more organic, but we think that has the best ROI.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then one more follow-up. Could you talk a little bit more about instrument placements into competitive accounts you've made over the last one to two years. I know some of your competitors have talked about those opportunities reopening for them. So, I'm curious if you have data on retention for some of the accounts that you have displaced over the last year or two? Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. We measure the retention trends for our instrument customer base as a whole. And we've seen an improving trend in those retention levels for the consumables that come from our instrument customers and we're around \u2013 and that's improving every quarter, at low rates at this point. But we're at 98% retention. So, that's \u2013 and this quarter is a little better than last and last quarter is a little better than the quarter before. And so, we're pleased with that and...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I'd expand beyond that to say it's not just instruments, it's across modalities. We're seeing improving retention trends in the U.S. in reference lab, consumables, rapid assay. And it's one of the things that's helping our underlying growth. It's also helping improve our underlying net price realization. It's a very positive trend and goes back to some of the comments we were making about the network effect that, as we're bringing together different instrument solutions through integrated systems architecture and have invested well above $100 million plus ahead of the industry on these types of initiatives over time, we're seeing the benefits of that. And, I think, that aids retention and will continue to aid retention going forward.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. The other thing, Ryan, we're seeing is we've shared this metric from time to time, the percentage of our customers that we believe are loyal customers or significant customers for both our in-house and reference lab. And, I think, several years ago, we said that was in the high-30%s, 36% to 38%, depending on what year you picked.","We're now at 47% of our customers who are loyal in one or the other or both of the in-house instrument and reference lab, are loyal in both. It's an interesting number because it has grown, but it's still below 50%, which just shows how much runway we have ahead to continue to build a complete diagnostic experience with our customers.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thank you for that. That's helpful color.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks so much. You mentioned some underlying or better underlying margin improvement in your updated guidance net of the incremental investments that you're making. And is that just a function of the improved organic growth profile or is there other initiatives going on? And as we think about the longer term drivers of profit improvement, where do you see some of the more meaningful opportunities near-term? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Erin, in simple terms, I think we had obviously a great start to the year in the first quarter. And looking ahead, we do see some incremental benefit from the stronger organic growth profile that we've highlighted, which is offset by the $10 million of incremental investment that we're advancing. And the net of that is it's a bit better than where we were in our original guidance, and it's at the high-end of our long-term goals.","I think our long-term goals are consistent with where we've been, which is we see the opportunity to sustain 50 to 100 basis points of annual margin improvement. We think the gross margin will be a key driver of that, aided by strong growth in recurring revenues, CAG Diagnostics revenues, as well as productivity in areas like our lab business, ongoing improvement there.","And we think that we can also get operating expense leverage as we continue to invest against the long-term potential of this highly profitable and durable annuity that is at the core of our economic model. So, a similar long-term outlook and we're tracking really well this year as we position ourselves for that 10% plus organic revenue growth goal that we're hoping to continue to achieve.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And Erin, from a modality point of view, obviously, we've got volume leverage and productivity initiatives in our core reference lab networks around the world, the benefit from the double-digit growth we're seeing in the lab business. And on the VetLab side, obviously, the growth in the \u2013 that's a good business and the growth in the recurring revenues of VetLab consumables, both of those augmented by a couple percent price realization and effective management of costs are two of the big \u2013 I think between the two of those, it's easily over 60% of IDEXX's total revenues.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Excellent. Thanks. And you mentioned the 45 new reps, I think, you said and some new regions as well. What regions are you adding and how quickly should these reps fully ramp up based on the experience you've seen so far? And just that hybrid versus direct model in your other countries, are you expanding the direct effort elsewhere as well? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. We go through a systematic process of looking at our account coverage around the country. And it's a pretty complicated process because you have to kind of redraw the lines. So, we see where we see the highest ROI. And some of that is in having fewer accounts per rep, so that reps can call on those accounts because that's what grows the revenues.","And some of it is covering some of what we call the white space which is the \u2013 I don't know, roughly 5% or 6% of the country that we don't have direct account coverage because it's highly rural. We cover by phone, but now we're adding some account coverage.","So, this is really the highest ROI places to make those investments. Those 45 reps are, of course, both sales and our field support organization, both of which are highly appreciated by the customers and help drive growth.","It generally takes a quarter for them to get trained and get into those territories. I think they start generating a return after that quarter. So, we're really timing this so we're going to be in great shape for the fourth quarter of 2017, always an important instrument placement quarter.","But they grow in productivity over time. You can just see what's happened, we did the expansion in the beginning of 2015, and we're still seeing productivity growth from that expansion in the first quarter of 2017. So, it's a \u2013 you get growth in productivity of those reps.","With regard to your comments of international, we think we're about \u2013 right now in terms of the 70% direct and 30%, now 30%, many of those, we do have a strong in-country presence, but we also work with distribution. Sometimes they provide logistics or collections or sometimes there's a full presence. And supporting our distributors is \u2013 these are generally more emerging markets and \u2013 or places where it's just not \u2013 doesn't make sense to have a direct presence.","So, I think we're going to, obviously, be continuing to grow appropriately our feet on the street internationally consistent with the revenue growth. But I don't see \u2013 I think we've made the shifts we want to make in fully direct now for all intents and purposes. I think we have the right mix right now.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I actually wanted to piggyback on Erin's question on the gross margin. I mean, certainly 150 basis points improvement, much better than we had thought in the quarter. Just kind of talk about pacings of the gross margin for the rest of the year and I guess full year expectations for where you think it'll end up?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I think we are targeting continued gross margin improvement. I think that the investments that we're talking about will be relatively more in the OpEx line in terms of how they're going to flow through the year.","So, I mentioned Q2, the net of that will be relatively flat and that is we will have some ramp in the OpEx and some of the lab capacity investments are impacting gross margin, but those, of course, will pay off for us, it's basically they will ramp. But I think you should expect a profile moving forward in the near term that is margin gains driven by on the gross margin line and where we're reinvesting that in OpEx just given the growth opportunity we see.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, still, staying on \u2013 I guess, if you look at sort of the out year expectations on the business. I know you've guided to 50 to 100 basis points for the longer term model. Is there an opportunity to sort of have a bigger step change than that on a recurring basis? I mean can that go 50 basis points higher over time? Is that \u2013 would you need to see a better mix shift in that or just see more adoption of product? I'm just simply saying like is there an opportunity on the margin to see it sustainably go up another 50 or so basis points on an annual basis?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think we will continue to drive gross margin improvement. That is a key part of our goals, and I think if we're successful growing the way we think we can on the recurring CAG side. That will aid that dynamic. I think we always have the choice to govern the pace of the investment that we're investing back in the business. And just building on Jon's earlier comments, I think we want to build this annuity as large as we can make it, and so I think we try to calibrate that expectation to invest in things like the international opportunity and growing the U.S. market where it makes sense and on balance we still think that 50 to 100 basis points is a \u2013 I think it's very much aligned with how we think about managing the business, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think we can always change that dynamic over time, but I think given the growth opportunities that we see, the broad range of innovation we're bringing to the market that requires support, not just from commercial resources but from enabling information technology, we think that's a reasonable balance and outlook for the business. This is clearly a very powerful business model that has a lot of profit potential and \u2013 but we think we're balancing that in the right kind of ways.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's a \u2013 building on Brian's comment, it's a virtual cycle, and we can really see that in play in our revised guidance in 2017. As Brian said, we raised the constant-currency operating margin expansion guidance for the year to the high end of our long term of 75 to 100 basis points, and yet that's with augmented investments which we think will help us with longer term growth of that very profitable recurring revenue, which itself will help us with margins.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So, it's a virtual cycle, and it's driven by an incredible technology portfolio that we have, that quite frankly just gets better and better. I mean, that's what's interesting is, it's gotten better and better over the last five years. Starting with the launch of really back to launch of ProCyte and then Catalyst One and SDMA and SediVue and there's a whole lot going on in the information technology side, and so, we're really in a \u2013 all supported by the fact that people love their pets and are underserved by the veterinary profession today, and meaning that as vets get better at communicating the value of the services that they provide, pet owners respond and that's a lot of what's behind our technology and our commercial investment. So, it's a virtual cycle and we have long-term goals, and we manage that year-by-year within those long-term goals.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian, I'll beat you up offline on how the out-year OpEx leverage isn't better than 50 to 100 bps. I'll focus on two other questions. Maybe the first one, on the reference lab, growth was really solid. The growth rate accelerated. I think the stacked growth was actually the strongest that I can see in my model looking back 10 years.","So, Brian, can you revisit the international versus U.S. lab commentary? And then, Jon, if you can speak to the long-term opportunity within U.S. reference lab and if you see some opportunities for accelerated market share gains sort of in light of the recent acquisition of Antech by Banfield.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Just on the performance, then I'll turn over to Jon, but we said it was 13% organic growth. It was actually a little bit higher than that, and it was comparable growth in U.S. and international markets. And to your point, Jon, I think we were up against some really strong compares. So, we agree that it was an excellent performance on the lab front, both U.S. and internationally.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. The growth in reference lab is really three factors. One is that we're getting some price realization. Of course, everybody said, well, why did you offer SDMA at no incremental charge? Well, we did offer it at no incremental charge, but now the chemistry panel that all customers are getting is much higher value. And that allows us to realize price and realize some of that value in price.","The second \u2013 and that's not a big number, as Brian said it was, I think, 3% in the quarter, 2% to 3% for the year. That's for all-U.S., but reference labs is a contributor to that, all-U.S. CAG recurring diagnostics.","And second is that we are growing our customers that we have. They're growing. And sometimes, the customers don't give us all their lab business, but they're shifting more of their lab business to us. It's kind of hard for us to measure that. But we are growing our existing customers.","Part of it is because they're adopting more testing. Maybe they're running more chemistry because it's a better case for preventative care. Maybe they are picking up a molecular diagnostics or fecal antigen that they previously were not \u2013 they were doing manually or just not doing at all. I mean, they're expanding their standard of care.","And then the third is that we are adding customers and adding more customers at the same time that we're seeing improved retention rates with our existing customer base. Of course, all of that takes field presence to make that happen. It doesn't just happen. It happens because of our extraordinarily professional sales, professional service vets and the field support representatives that we have in the field that are the face of IDEXX to veterinary practices.","And so, we think the opportunity is there on all three of those dimensions to continue to grow. What is actually \u2013 it's interesting, the reference lab is the largest diagnostic modality, largest contributor to our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay. Helpful color. And then, the other one, Jon, is just on the sales force. I get it, I mean, you're putting up tremendous top line growth, and three or six months is an incredibly quick return for a rep. But where do you see that number leveling off? In other words, I think you and I talked on the call, maybe nine or 12 months ago, you upped it and you thought you were where you needed to be, and here you're taking another 10% higher, 25,000 vet practices and over 400 reps. I know they're all not out in the field but that's a big number when your arguably next biggest competitor from a direct basis might be 60 or 70 reps. So, maybe just looking out, is this something where, hey, you can always add 5% or 10% to sort of continue to augment the top line or should we think about a number out there as a finite number to point to where you think you'd have a fully \u2013 a full sales force out there, specific to the U.S.? Thanks, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think what we saw is we have seen the tremendous response to our innovation in the field and yet we believe that the constraint here is time with customers. The more we call on customers the faster they grow. And so, it's a tough call. Okay. It's a tough call about when or where or what rate to make incremental investments but obviously we're able to do it and expand our operating margin target for the year which is good. I mean, we feel good about both of those. Where will that go going forward? It's a tough call.","The other thing we have going on is we're continuing to see growth in productivity of our field professionals. I just want to correct you on one thing, the 435, those are only the people in the field calling on customers. They include sales reps, they include our field support representatives are highly valued and they include our professional service and veterinarians. They do not include people on the phone that are sales or support. They do not include managers. They're just field feet on the street. It's a very, very clean metric. And so, we think it's the right call. Given the incredible response we're seeing, I mean, the over 1,000 SNAP Pros and the momentum in that business, we actually ended the quarter with a backlog, that's just the number that we installed. That's just \u2013 I remember you asking me about SNAP Pros two years ago, why can't we have more SNAP Pro placements? Well, we got more SNAP Pro placements now.","And look at the competitive Catalyst, 18% year-over-year growth in competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements. And look at the 14% EVI productivity. Part of that is coming from the maturation of the sales organization, and part of that's coming from enabling support. We're actually fully moved to a new CRM. We're leveraging the salesforce.com platform, fully implemented now in the U.S. field organization and highly leveraged by the incredible data that we have that helps the rep support the customer.","I mean, they have incredible data at their fingertips now, real-time, that helps them engage in very substantive conversations with customers where they can act like true diagnostic consultants how to expand the testing. And because now they have these relationships because they have enough customers, they can call on the average customer 10 times over the course of the year. And that's what we achieved in 2016. We see nice \u2013 that combined with professionalism and the data that they have at their disposal on our innovation portfolio, we see nice returns on that. So, it's an art, but we're pleased to be able to do it and expand our constant currency operating margin target.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Congrats on another excellent quarter. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the gross margin and particularly with the reference lab. The strength that you guys have noted in terms of kind of accelerating revenue growth there, I would assume that that has your \u2013 one of your highest incremental gross margins dropdown from an incremental test perspective.","So, if I run the math, if one-third of your total revenue is coming from this highly incrementally profitable business, you can get to your 50 to 100 basis points of kind of margin target expansion just in that business alone almost. And so, I'm just trying to reconcile how we should be thinking about the rest of the business that's also growing double-digits, that's good margin, when we think about the long-term opportunity to expand beyond the 50 to 100 basis points that was reiterated today. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. I do think we see good potential that flows from the incremental growth, as you point out. I think that the \u2013 that is offset to a degree by some of the investments that we're talking about and \u2013 which is supporting the long-term growth of the annuity. And on balance, we think that yields the outcome \u2013 the outlook for 75 to 100 bps is \u2013 of improvement this year is very reasonable in that context. And that's how we look at it kind of in an integrated way. So, I think we're acknowledging that there is good gross profit improvement potential, particularly for growing the recurring CAG modalities at a good rate. And we anticipate continuing to improve on the lab front as we grow.","And so, I think we're aligned with that. It's just, it really comes back to, I think, fundamentally, how we are choosing to manage the business in the context of the growth potential that we see for the company. And we are going to balance margin improvement with reinvesting towards the long-term growth potential, and we think that's the way the company has been running for a long time very successfully. And we continue to see, particularly with the innovation pipeline that we have and the global market opportunity that continues to grow, a lot of opportunity to continue on that path. So, that's how we're choosing to manage the margin equation.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Let me comment a little more about the lab. The lab is a very, very operationally intensive, hour-by-hour type of business, very different than our other businesses. And we are good, and we have the opportunity to get a lot better. And we are making systems and other types of investments that will be leverage-able over time. And it takes a while to roll those out in our different geographies. And we will get very good returns on that.","Our primary goal here with the reference lab is to be able to serve the customer consistently and with quality. That is the number one thing that customers care about. They care about that before they care about an advanced test. So, that's table stakes.","And so, we want to make sure that we are world-class in that capability. So, I would say with regard to the reference lab, we see long-term, very significant gross margin expansion in the reference lab, but it happens over time as we both get the leverage but also prioritize the customer experience.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think Jon is making a very important point, just to give you a sense of maybe the tone of the business right now and how we're managing things. We're growing very, very quickly. So, to have the kind of consistent double-digit organic growth in our reference labs, to execute that well, our number one priority is to make sure that we have flawless turnaround times and the capacity to do everything that we need to do to support our customers. And it's not to say that we're not trying to improve as we grow, but that's our first priority and that's certainly where the business context is now. So, on balance, I think we've got a reasonable outlook and we'll continue to try to perform well and deliver against that.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And what it means is there's a lot of long-term runway. It means that the runway is there for many years to come. And it comes back to the enduring opportunity we see not only on the top-line growth but on the margin expansion. It's an enduring number. It may not be as much as you want in any one particular year but it has a long runway associated with it.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the color. And then just quickly on the market stats. I know the industry faced a very challenging first quarter comparison, but the data you presented and certainly one of your largest peer also presented kind of a decel. And I'm just trying to \u2013 how do we think about, is this just a comp issue, or is there something perhaps a little bit going on in the end market after two or three years of pretty rapid growth off of the lows? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I really appreciate that question, too, and we measure this with every data source that we can get our hands on, some of which are proprietary to our own systems, and some of which are external validations of all different kinds. And the net of that is we really do not see a change. We don't see a deceleration, we don't see an acceleration. We see the trends that we have seen over the last several years are intact, the same rate. I think the so called deceleration that you saw in Q1 was really a comp issue because, as Brian said, you take the average two year stack growth, it was 6.8%. So...","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","6.9%, actually.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","6.9%. Yeah. So, I think that you take the two years, add them together, and divide by two. So, yeah, I think everything that tells us this is kind of steady as you go, 5.5% to 6.5% same-store sales growth market at the practice level \u2013 of course there's a little bit of net practice formation that adds to that, diagnostics is growing faster, all those things, but really kind of a steady \u2013 as far as we can tell, it's steady.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter and thanks for the questions. The first one is a two-parter, just to clarify on the investments you're making. The extra 45 people in the field, how many of those are going to the so-called white space versus going into an existing territory? And then the second part of that is on the lab capacity. How much of that is going to service existing products versus scaling for the future?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","It's mostly greater coverage in existing territories, and a small part of it is white space expansion. And the capacity is really to support the core lab, the existing products.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, my second question is on the international launch of SediVue. Can you just speak to some of the opportunities and challenges? The number dipped a bit sequentially. My guess is that might be a timing issue because you have reiterated your goal for 2,000 for the full year. So, could you just speak to maybe how many placements were in North America versus international in the first quarter?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","There were only 47 placements in international. So the bulk of that was North America placements. And just for clarity, Mark, we very consistently \u2013 if you go back over time and look at our premium instrument placements, Q1 is typically less than 20% of the full year number. And so that, it's very much aligned with our outlook for 2,000-plus placements. We feel we're right on track and it's very consistent seasonality that we've seen in our business for a number of years.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And what I would say about \u2013 we think in the near term, SediVue is mostly a North American product, a more sophisticated market and such, but the opportunity we have internationally is they could sell a SediVue or they could sell a Catalyst and get much higher consumables. So, our teams are still very focused on Catalyst placements, and that's higher economic value or ROI for them.","So, SediVues are typically in the more sophisticated markets that are add-ons to existing customers, but I think you're going to \u2013 and we haven't completely rolled out SediVue internationally \u2013 it's going to occur over the course of the year. And so \u2013 but I think you're going to see it being mostly in the next couple of years, mostly a North American opportunity whereas Catalyst One is the international opportunity.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","All right. Hey. Thank you for squeezing me in, and happy Friday.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","So, I'm going to stay away from the margin for you guys, and then just want to talk real quickly about capital deployment strategy. You've been buying back shares a lot in the last year, couple years. Is that still a primary focus in your capital deployment strategy?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, we're comfortable. We've had a very successful program. We've bought back $3.2 billion worth of stock at an average price of $27 a share over time. So, this has been a long-term strategy that's had very good outcomes. We look at this on an ongoing basis. We try to understand our business strategy and the intrinsic value we see in the company, and to the degree that we have cash flow beyond the investments in the core business that we're generating, if we think there's value in share repurchases, we'll continue to allocate capital that way. That's been our past practice and we continue to have that level of confidence and that's what we were signaling today.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got you. All right. And then can you talk about, it looks like a little bit of a low volume quarter in terms of veterinary practice volumes, but reference lab and consumables were pretty \u2013 you had pretty much a blowout quarter there. Can you talk about how volumes correlate on a quarter-to-quarter basis with your consumable and reference lab businesses?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, as you can tell, it's not that great a correlation. I think, it's because we're expanding the diagnostic category; whereas, the clinic revenue is the entire revenue of the clinic of all customers, whether they are customers or not. Diagnostics is typically 15% of the total and a growing percent. So, there are going to be some disconnects between our innovation-based market expansion strategy in the diagnostics and software categories versus the entire practice revenue growth.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. When we report the market numbers, that's a same-store number for all sales in the clinic, and we believe diagnostics, itself, in the market is growing 1.5 to 2.5 points above that when you add in practice formation and our \u2013 the fact that diagnostics is growing quicker. And, of course, we're growing faster than market. So, I think those are the dynamics that contribute to the differences.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Have a good weekend.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I think that concludes the call. We appreciate all the questions. Again, I just want to thank everybody who dialed in And, again, congratulate our IDEXXers around the country and around the world for a great quarter and pursuit of the purpose to be a great company, that creates exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of our pets, the people who love them, and livestock. Thank you very much. That closes the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude you conference call for today.

Please go ahead.","Merilee Raines","Good morning and thanks very much for joining our call today. As reported in our earnings release this morning, our first quarter revenues were $322.7 million, yielding organic growth of 10%. And diluted earnings per share were $0.72, a year-to-year increase of 16%.","Overall, this was in line quarter for us with financial results generally on par with our thinking at the time of our January earnings call. While actual currency rates for the quarter versus our forecasted rates in January contributed about $3.5 million to reported revenues. The impact to earnings per share was immaterial.","Taking a quick look at the economic backdrop, the economic environment is a backdrop for our Companion Animal first quarter performance. First, starting with the U.S. Q1 patient visit growth from a subset of nearly 500 practices using our Cornerstone Practice Management System, was roughly 5%. Practice revenues grew by roughly 7%. Both of these metrics show a meaningful increase over the fourth quarter growth in patient visits of 1% and practice revenues of about 3.5%.","Well, some of this increase maybe due to the mild weather experienced over good portion of the country, we are encouraged that the improving trend we saw over the back half of 2011 continues into 2012, even if the growth rates do not sustain at the levels experienced in the first quarter. In contrast to the improving U.S. environment, in Europe we saw the organic growth rate for our Companion Animal businesses decreased to 5% as compared to 8% growth experienced in the fourth quarter last year.","Performance varies widely in the region with countries such as Germany and France showing strong performance and performance in countries such as Italy and Spain, reflecting the impact of their challenging fiscal situation. On balance we continue to believe that our businesses will benefit modestly from an improvement in the macro environment over the course of 2012 with 1% to 2% volume growth attributable to a more robust economy.","Now for some further detail on first quarter revenue performance of some of our businesses. VetLab Instrument and Consumable revenue of a $102 million, grew 9% organically. Sales of instruments were $20.5 million, also 9% organic growth. Our worldwide chemistry placements were up 20%, with solid performance by both Catalyst and VetTest.","This quarter\u2019s growth is aided by the relatively easy compare we had versus the placements in the first quarter of 2011, prior to the launch of our protocol based rebate programs in the U.S., in the third quarter of 2011. As you recall, we saw an acceleration in the rate of placements in the U.S. in the back half of the year, due to the success of this marketing program.","We also saw strong performance in our hematology placements with a combined placement growth of 25%. ProCyte remains an attractive choice for our larger customers and sales of new and recertified LaserCytes are continuing to do well in accounts with lower volumes.","Our Asia Pacific region had over 30% growth in total instrument placements across the VetLab suite in the first quarter. And we believe the region presents an opportunity for both Catalysts and ProCyte. In Japan we placed our first ProCyte unit in Q1, a quarter ahead of our expected launch schedule.","Consumable revenues of $69.8 million grew organically 10% or 9% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. This is inline with our 2011 normalized growth. And our projections for a full-year 2012 normalized organic growth. Consumable growth is driven by volume growth from our increasing installed base of instruments, increased testing as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-clinic lab with Catalyst and ProCyte, an increased same-store testing as a result of improving patient visit volume.","For little more color on a couple of these consumable growth drivers. First, in Q1 more than 35% of our Catalysts and ProCyte placements were to new and competitive accounts. Additionally, we continue to see an uplift in consumable usage when an existing IDEXX customer purchases a catalyst and\/or a ProCyte.","Our first quarter rapid assay sales of $43.7 million grew organically 13%, when normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, revenues grew by 10%. About half of our normalized growth is attributable to higher price realization on U.S. Canine products following the list price increase that went into effect last October. We expect this price favorability to continue through the second and third quarters, although at a slightly lower level, as the first quarter also benefited from changes to seasonal marketing programs that resulted in somewhat lower discounts.","Other key contributors to our first quarter growth included volume growth in our Canine Vector-borne Disease test as well as a successful ramp of our SNAP Feline Pancreatitis test, which was launched in the second quarter of 2011. Our expectation for 2012 is to see normalized organic growth rates in the range of 4% to 6% for the rapid assay business, which represents some upside potential from the 4% we were expecting at the start of the year.","This improved outlook is reflective of somewhat stronger growth in Canine volume in the first quarter. We expect that growth rates will be higher in the first half and then moderate as we anniversary price increases in 2011 product launches. Our reference laboratory and consulting services business with revenues of $101.9 million, achieved reported growth of just over 14% in the first quarter, which translated to a 11% organic growth.","Growth was strong across the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, however we saw a bit of softening in the European market during the quarter with lower than expected growth in lab volume, as so we will be watching this as we move forward. The majority of our organic growth came from higher test volumes due to the addition of new customers as well as an improvement in same-store sales in the U.S.","Compared to the first quarter of 2011, a lower portion of our growth came from realized price during the quarter. This dynamic is the result of our increasing success over time in selling our lab services in conjunction which our in-clinic diagnostic offerings. In such situations discounts on laboratory services are used by our customers to purchase our capital equipment, are positive for us and that the discounts are reinvested in IDEXX, it is also positive for our customers, as when they use our in-house equipment in conjunction with our reference lab, they benefit from the deeper insights that come from an integrated approach to diagnostic testing.","Acquisitions contributed just under 4% to our 14% reported labs and consulting services growth in the quarter. We were pleased with the performance of the RADIL and ALX acquisitions that were completed late in the fourth quarter, integration of these businesses has gone very well. In addition to these acquired labs we opened a new day lab in St. Louis, Missouri during the quarter. This brings our total global network to 57 labs.","We are confirming our 10% organic growth estimate for labs and consulting services for 2012 with slightly higher volume growth being offset by lower price realization than what we anticipated in January. Our practice management and digital imaging systems with revenues of $20.6 million grew organically 8% in the first quarter consistent with our expectations. Customers continue to appreciate the benefits of our integrated solutions and product line enhancements, and this leads us to continue to expect organic growth in high-single to low-double digit range for 2012.","Our livestock and poultry diagnostic revenues declined 6% organically to $22.2 million in the first quarter. This decrease was driven in part by the anticipated events we have mentioned previously including a decline in BSE revenues due to the change in the EU testing regulation and the step down in testing from an eradication program in Germany. We have also seen somewhat lower than anticipated ramp of new product revenues including our first SNAP test for use by the Vet at the farm and our bovine pregnancy test. Both of these tests involved changes to current testing protocols and so the adoption curve can be a bit difficult to predict. We now project that organic growth for this business in 2012 will be flat to low single-digit down from our projection in January of mid-to-low single-digit growth.","Our Water business grew 4% organically to $19.6 million. This growth was inline with our thinking and is consistent with our expectations for full-year organic growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L gross margin at 54% and operating expenses at 35% were roughly inline with our thinking in January. Our effective tax rate of 31.7% and our share count were also inline with our expectations. As for the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $185 million of cash and $257 million of debt for a net debt position of $72 million. Our inventory balance of $141 million was approximately $8 million higher than the level at the end of the fourth quarter due primarily to timing of inventories associated with certain of our instrument platforms. We expect these levels to come down over the next couple of quarters. DSO at 43 days remains in good shape. Our free cash flow was $70 million or 41% of net income.","As noted in the past free cash flow tends to be lower in the first quarter due to regularly occurring events such as annual performance based compensation payments and increases in receivables related to the ramp of some of our more seasonal product lines. Looking forward, we project full-year revenues of $1.31 billion to $1.32 billion an increase of about $12 million to the low and high ends of the our range relative to the guidance provided at the time of our January earnings call, which is the result of the favorable impact of currency.","Our revenue guidance implies both reported and organic growth of 8% to 9%, as a 1% favorable impact due to acquisitions offsets a 1% negative impact of currency. Organic growth is unchanged relative to our outlook in January, well our current assumption of 1% to 2% increase in volume growth due to a more robust economy is slightly improved from our expectation at the time of our January earnings call. We now expect a somewhat lower contribution to growth from price realization. We continue to project full-year gross margin to be approximately 54% for the year about 100 basis points above the full-year 2011 rate and we expect gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 100 basis points higher than our full-year average due to the seasonality of our Vector-borne disease testing business.","We continue to project operating expenses to be between 34% and 35% of revenue for the full-year all leading to an operating margin between 19% and 20% for the year. This would represent a roughly 50 basis point improvement from last year when 2011 is adjusted for the favorable impact of the pharma payments that we received that totaled about $4 million. We expect the tax rate to be between 31.5% to 32% for the full-year which is unchanged from our previous guidance. As a reminder our projected tax rate is approximately 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2011 primarily due to the fact that we have non-incorporated the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit into our 2012 rate.","All of this leads us to 2012 earnings per share guidance of 307 to 312, the increase of $0.02 to the  high-end of our range reflects the favorable impact of currency relative to the rates assumed at the time of our January earnings call. We are increasing the lower end of our guidance by $0.03 which reflects the currency impact that I just mentioned as well an additional penny from business performance. We continue to project free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income.","Thanks. And now, I would like to turn over to Jon, for some further comments.","Jonathan Ayers","Okay. Thank you Merilee. I\u2019ll provide a couple of updates on the business and the progress of some of our innovations, then I wanted to turn to an important update on our U.S. distribution strategy and the FTC investigation, at that time we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A.","Our business and the execution of our strategy is on track. The strong Q1 organic growth of 10% was gratifying and we\u2019re pleased with the apparent pick-up in the U.S. market even as Europe slows. However our outlook for the year, but for currency assumption remains essentially unchanged at 8% to 9% organic growth. This outlook considers the potential transitory benefit of the favorable weather compared in the U.S. in Q1 the uncertainty generally in Europe and a strong Asia and Latin America, and of course our continued success in bringing innovations to our market globally.","In the area of new products, we were pleased to receive USDA approval and to announce the launch earlier this week of our newest SNAP kit for canine and Vector-borne disease SNAP 4Dx Plus. SNAP 4Dx Plus is able to detect a fifth and sixth tick-borne disease adding to the four Vector-borne diseases including Heartworm that we already cover with SNAP 4Dx. We will be offering SNAP 4Dx Plus in the place of it predecessor 4Dx and will not be charging anymore for the upgrade in capability from four to six Vector-borne disease tests in one kit. This will be true for both the in-house version, the SNAP kit, and our lab offering of the same test.","We\u2019re also pleased that we\u2019ve launched a valuable new test for our highly successful Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer, Phenobarbital, a standard therapy used to control seizures in dogs. Virtually, every practice has patients on Phenobarbital and testing is critical to determine if the dosage is within the therapeutic range for that patient. So, in-house Phenobarbital top test is a valuable application of a real-time diagnostic result during the appointment. The IDEXX Catalyst Dx Analyzer is the only point-of-care solution that is able to test for Phenobarbital levels, yet another differentiator.","We\u2019ve talked in the recent past about our strategy to support the veterinary and communicating the value of pet healthcare and regular visits with their clients, the pet owner. In that vein, we\u2019ve launched in the past six months the pet health network and our iPad app that allows practice show deteriorated graph declines in an easy and real-time way during patient visits. These offerings have been extremely well received by our customers.","In Q2, we\u2019re introducing two more offerings as part of that strategy. First, we\u2019ve partnered closely with Purina PetCare Company's PurinaCare, a leader in pet wellness plans to co-promote their offering with our customers. Adoption of pet wellness plans is another way to engage pet owners resulting in more regular visits and more frequent and approximate users of diagnostic testing as part of preventative care, not to mention complains with follow-on on any conditions identified as part of a preventative care visit.","Second, we\u2019ll be introducing a very significant advancement in the way our customers can access the results of our diagnostic offerings both from the reference lab and the in-house lab, and can share those results in an intuitive way with pet owners. We call this advancement VetConnect PLUS, leveraging over 10,000 customers who regularly log on to our VetConnect website today for reference lab results.","We\u2019ve developed VetConnect PLUS using Cloud technology to present the results of blood work run either at our reference lab or our in-house equipment, side-by-side and over time to facilitate data comparisons and the visibility of trends. This results can be viewed either on a web browser or in an iPad or tablet and are available real-time as soon as new results on patients are available.","The benefits are multifold. First, the ability to see the current blood work parameters in the context of all historical runs thus adding the medical insights that come from trending, say in the same way that our P&L is far more interesting when compared to prior P&Ls. VetConnect PLUS will be able to easily and intuitively grab any particular parameter over time to aiding this insight.","Second, all the results that will run in our reference lab and on our in-house equipment will be available for this historical trending. Third, on an iPad, these results will be available real-time within seconds on anything run, including on our in-house equipment. We\u2019re leveraging the SmartService platform to enable this capability.","Fourth, the iPad or tablet modality is highly useful for sharing the results with pet owners, and of course real-time if run on our in-house equipment, and emailing these results to the pet family directly from the iPad. Finally, the same analytics capability on all blood work results will be integrated in the Cornerstone\u2019s Electronic Medical Record System.","We think that VetConnect PLUS will be a pretty big differentiator for both our in-house and reference lab offering, and we\u2019re offering the core Cloud capability free to all of our customers of our diagnostic offerings, of course they\u2019ve got to business their own iPads.","VetConnect PLUS will become available to our customers in the U.S. at the end of the quarter although we already have several dozen customers using it and rating about it in data form.","Finally, I wanted to give an update on our U.S. distributor strategy and the FTC investigation. Through a series of discussions with the FTC, we\u2019ve gained an appreciation of the nature of the FTC\u2019s concerns, which relate to our agreements with our three largest U.S. distributors. We\u2019ve also taken the opportunity to conduct a close review of the effectiveness of our U.S. Companion Animal Distribution Strategy for instrument consumables and rapid assay kits. We\u2019ve been thinking about steps we could take that would allow us to avoid potential litigation that would make sense for our business.","After this analysis, we\u2019ve decided to announce a prospective change to our distribution strategy, which we think will have both business benefits and address the FTC concerns as we now understand them. This refinement will focus our distribution and investments and free up somewhere between $6 million and $12 million in channel cost that can and will be redirected to augment our sales, marketing, distribution and customer support investments to support our continued growth.","Under this refinement of our longstanding U.S. distributor strategy, we expect one of our three major U.S. distributors, those are Butler Schein Animal Health, Webster, which is part of Patterson Dental and MWI will move from being a value-added strategic partner as they all free currently are to more of a generalist distributor. This generalist will perform standard and customer services for IDEXX such as processing orders from veterinary customers and logistical support of shipping IDEXX products. This generalist would not be down by our competitive products policy, and thus we\u2019d expect it to carry competitive products without restrictions along with our IDEXX kits and consumables.","Finally, the generalist distributor will have amended terms with IDEXX that will reflect its status having been changed from value-added, and we\u2019d expect this would of course result in a lower distributor margin.","The funding that accrues to IDEXX, as a result of this change will be redeployed to incremental sales and marketing investments consistent with our longstanding strategy of using a combination of both IDEXX direct \u2013 IDEXX sales and distribution resources to serve our customers.","We would anticipate that the remaining value-added distributors, likely four of the total five we now have in total, including two smaller distributors will continue on terms generally as they\u2019re today and would continue to be subject to what we define as our competitive products policy. In this way, we\u2019ll continue to treat these value-added distributors as extension of our sales force appraises it continues to work well for IDEXX in the U.S. market.","We anticipate that these new arrangements would be negotiated over the next several months and would take affect no later than the new contract year, which begins January 1st, 2013 and even earlier if one of the distributors wish to change the generalist before the expiration of their annual contract with IDEXX.","We do not know at this time, which distributor would change from value-added to generalist as this one involved discussions with each of our distributors and of course their analysis of operating as either IDEXX value-added or generalist also carrying competitive products. We also do not know how longer it will take to finalize the new arrangements. In the meantime, we\u2019ll operate the business as usual honoring the current distributor contracts.","We do not believe these changes have any materially impact on our strategic plan over the next five years. In terms of how much IDEXX revenue would come under the generalist arrangement when we make this refinement to our distribution strategy, sales \u2013 sales to the U.S. distributors\u2019 account for about 20% of total IDEXX revenue. Depending on a number of factors we think somewhere between 25% and 40% or 5% to 8% of our total IDEXX revenues could come under the generalist arrangement.","Importantly, we believe this revised distribution arrangement satisfies the FTC concerns as we understand them, with at least one national distributor as a generalist also carrying competitive products. Our understanding is that the FTC has put their processes on hold as we carryout this plan to its conclusion in the new arrangement. Following the execution of a modified agreement that addresses the FTC\u2019s concerns as we understand them, we anticipate the FTC would seek to formalize the modified arrangement in the form of a consent order.","Of course we don\u2019t speak for the FTC and can\u2019t guarantee any particular results, but we\u2019ve enough confidence in our prospects or success with this approach that we\u2019re setting this process in motion. We still believe we\u2019ve a very strong legal position for all the reasons that we\u2019ve discussed in the past. However, we always have to weigh the prospects of lengthy and expensive litigation that would involve the whole industry against the available alternatives.","In summary, we believe this plan makes a lot of sense for our business and our veterinary customers and also helps us to avoid litigation with the FTC.","So, before I open the call to Q&A, we\u2019ve an economic environment with modest economic growth and a competitive environment in the diagnostic space that is intensive as ever. We also believe that we're at a crossroads in the pet healthcare market, as vets are starting to adopt a series of practices many enabled by our technological innovations that better educate and engage the pet owner resulting in a gradual increase in visits, independent of the economy and in the adoption of appropriate preventative and chronic care along with acute care that will drive growth and utilization of our diagnostic and information technology offerings.","Leading edge practices are already demonstrating the potential of the pet owner to respond to this increase in communication. Pet owners thus better appreciate the relevance of appropriate veterinary care and the impact it has on the health, well being and longevity of their four legged family members. This trend will drive sustained growth for the veterinary practice and for IDEXX products and services for many years to come.","So with those opening comments, Merilee and I\u2019d like to open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) One moment please for the first question. And we\u2019ll go first to the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Jonathan Ayers","Good morning.","Merilee Raines","Good morning.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","I just wanted to maybe get a couple of more details on the potential non-exclusive arrangement. Do you think there is a risk that, that potentially more than one of your distributors want to switch to the new model?","Jonathan Ayers","David, thank you for the question. Of course, we can't predict how our distributors would change -- will react and we've begun discussions with them. But they have always had a chance to do alternative arrangements with IDEXX and that\u2019s really been part of our contracts and I think we had excellent relationships with distributors and they have had excellent relationships with us as value added distributors and the margins that, that generates for them. So we think it would be unlikely, but I think they each have to weigh the differences between carrying competitor product and being a value added distributor for IDEXX with a higher margin.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then just real quick on the arrangement with Purina when \u2013 can you give us some details and I guess how you think this is going to kind of evolve and what kind of financial arrangement it represents for IDEXX?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes. We\u2019re very excited about the partnership with Purina. We\u2019ve actually \u2013 its been in the works for quite a bit of time. We worked very closely with Purina to design if you will template preventative care plans that include the appropriate diagnostics. We do have some benefit when we bring a customer to the equation, but we think the larger benefit is that this is really part of a series of steps that helps customers increase preventative care with veterinarians and with pet owners. And of course the increase of preventative care that includes the appropriate preventative diagnostics will increase our volume.","So we think this is a tool, a value added tool that our sales force can bring to customers. It is a type of thing that is being talked about in the industry and PurinaCare is we think the way out of head in having designed the plan. So we\u2019re very excited about that partnership. But I would just say its one of many marketing efforts that we\u2019re working on to grow the veterinary industry. Nothing happens overnight in the veterinary industry, but tends do have staying power and long-term impacts, and I would say that this would be one of them.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","And then just real quick on guidance, it sounds like volume is a little bit better than what was originally expected, but pricing sounds like it could be a little bit lower than what you had expected. What's changed on the pricing front since the last update?","Merilee Raines","David, as I mentioned in my comments, we're seeing a little bit less price realization in the lab business than what we had expected. I also think in the VetLab business we've seen lower pricing somewhat on instruments and I also did mention in the last call that we were expecting that we would see as a result of protocol based rebate programs a bit of headwind on consumable pricing as well just because of the nature of that program also impacts consumable pricing as well as instrument pricing. So I think those would be the primary areas.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","You think on the lab side that that\u2019s more, does that reflect increased competition?","Merilee Raines","I really think it is a function of the programs that we've been executing in the marketplace over the last couple of years now and we\u2019re seeing the cumulative impact of that where the customers enter into these programs and the rebates are that they earn over a period of time are applied against in many cases in fact the majority of cases against capital equipment purchases from IDEXX so that really is the main driver. The competition has always been very aggressive in that market place and I don\u2019t think that, that the pricing dynamic in regard to competition is particularly different, that\u2019s always been pretty aggressive.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair & Company","Good morning, its Kristina for Ryan today. As it relates to the refinement of the distribution agreements if none of the distributors actually want to change to a generalist arrangement, can you actually push that change?","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, we\u2019re going to -- we will make a change to one of the three. We're very committed to doing so Kristina. We\u2019ll go through a process to select the distributors that best meet our needs as strategic distributors based on their track record commitment to the IDEXX line, other factors that we deem relevant. We certainly plan to conduct a fair and transparent process with our distributors in making these arrangement and evaluations.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks for the color. And then Jon, I guess turning to a different topic; one of the big trends we a heard a lot about at NAVC this year was the movement towards wellness plans. Two questions here. First, are you able to tie end-market hospital performance to these plans at all, meaning any data showing that they drive stronger growth for the vet, and second any data that you have that shows how these plans impact diagnostic utilization?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes. We've \u2013 yeah, of course its early returns with the PurinaCare, but we very much believe this drives \u2013 it drove both of those and because the diagnostics are part of the wellness plan together would drive a growth in the practice and growth in -- and of course then diagnostics is a natural follow-on to that. One of our very good customers has been a doing a form of this for a long time and they have been achieving the strong double-digit same-store sales growth for quite some time.","So I think there is good precedent, but its all on the execution, these things aren\u2019t simple and they do require a change in the practice and that\u2019s always a problem with -- its always a challenge for practices to change and so one of the great things about the PurinaCare is it\u2019s a system facilitates in that change process, just as many of our technologies that try to make it really easy for customers to change, but there is still that change in behavior and process has got to take place at the local practice.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks. And I had one last question, any idea how much of the end-market improvement may have been from the extra day in the quarter and easier weather comps on a year-over-year basis versus more of a sustained underlying uptick in the industry with a stronger consumer and more new pet acquisitions?","Jonathan Ayers","I think we've adjusted for the day. The weather is a great question. If you recall last year we had a horrible weather in the first quarter and this year we had great weather. So it is a very favorable weather compare and its tough to analyze that, but I think certainly that was a significant factor. We saw a gradual improvement over the course of 2011 and probably some of this is a continuation of that gradual improvement and other of it is the favorable weather compare.","Kristina Blaschek - William Blair & Company","Great. Thanks for all the color today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova with Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Yes. Hi, Jon. Hi, Merilee. Let me start with a question on the FTC agreement or the one you expect to sign. First of all what gives you the confidence that FTC will agree to just one distributor, one of your three major distributors coming off the exclusive agreement. What \u2013 how do you think about \u2013 how did you think about that and secondly what \u2013 to the extent you can discuss, what kind of an agreement do you expect to sign with the FTC?","Jonathan Ayers","Well, first of all we can't predict the FTC or speak for them. But we\u2019ve had discussions with the FTC, we believe we understand the nature of their concerns. We\u2019ve informed the FTC of our plans as described here today and we\u2019re trying to make this process as transparent as possible to the FTC staff, to the industry, and to the investment community. And of course there are no guarantees as I said, but we would not proceed down this path if we didn\u2019t have some confidence that this would resolve the FTC concerns making and also of course making a sense for our business.","With regard to what would happen, it\u2019s our sense that the FTC would seek to formalize the arrangement where we have one distributor that is carrying competitive product and carrying our product as a generalist instead of value added and thus at a different margin they seek to formalize that in the form of a consent degree. And so that\u2019s our expectation.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Okay. So that\u2019s the basic thing that you expect in the consent degree? Okay, and maybe as a follow-up to that, I am trying to just square way your comment, the economy did improve in the first quarter, you\u2019re seeing volume up 4% -- 5% and practice revenues up 7%, yet at the same time an organic growth of 10 overall \u2013 yet at the same time your organic revenue growth guidance for the full-year is unchanged, and in fact suggests that things should probably desiderate slightly, help me understand why the \u2013 why so conservative on the guidance?","Jonathan Ayers","Okay, so\u2026","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC","And does it have anything to do with it; in fact you\u2019re changing the distributor arrangement?","Jonathan Ayers","To the latter question, absolutely no impact on that, we don\u2019t expect any impact on that. This is a refinement and really an integrated strategy. So, the answer to that last question is no, when you say increase in 5%, this is our -- these are our Cornerstone customers, this is not the market as a whole. And our Cornerstone customers in general have done better than the market as a whole as we understand it. And so, second is part of that was \u2013 I think you saw it in the retail sales, it\u2019s a -- there is a favorable element that\u2019s probably transitory.","Third, of course that\u2019s only U.S. data, and over 40% of our revenues at IDEXX as a whole comes from outside the U.S. and of course Europe while it grew 5% in the first quarter for us in the companion animal business, that decelerated from 8% in the fourth quarter and I think that\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be a little bit more challenging situation. So, there are a lot of puts and takes. We\u2019ve not changed our organic growth guidance. It remains the same as it was in the last quarter.","Merilee Raines","Yeah, Miroslava, the other thing that I\u2019d add to that is it\u2019s kind of it\u2019s aligned with the comments on Europe growth. But the livestock and poultry business we did also lower the organic growth projection for the year for that business and that lowered performance in Q1 was partially offset by some strong growth in our dairy business due to some testing that happened in China and we expect that the level of that testing is going to drop down fairly significantly as we go through the year. So there are other parts of the business as well, the companion animal business that are -- it\u2019s all factored into our organic growth guidance for the year.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Taylor with C.L. King. Your line is open.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King & Associates, Inc","Hi. I guess my question relates to the potential changes in your distribution arrangements, but when you do eliminate one of your value-added distributors, do you expect a lot more of your business is going to shift into the remaining value-added distributors giving them new added incentive to want to remain so?","Jonathan Ayers","Well, first of all, we\u2019re not going to eliminate one of our value-added distributors. They\u2019ll continue to carry -- we would anticipate they continue to carry our line in more of a generalist than a value-added. Certainly \u2013 and nothing changes in this industry overnight and we don\u2019t want to disrupt pre-established relationships between our longstanding distributors and our mutual veterinary customers.","Certainly, the value-added ones that we\u2019ll be continuing to treat as an extension of our sales force, in that way we\u2019ll be training them, we\u2019ll be working very closely with them, all as we\u2019ve in the past to continue to grow our business. So it\u2019s kind of hard to predict how things could sort out. But I guess there could be some gradual shift over time.","I think one of the benefits we\u2019ll have is our remaining distributors will be more -- that will have one last national distributor came with on a value-added basis and therefore they\u2019ll probably I\u2019d say not that they won\u2019t motivate before, but more motivated continue to grow our business because of that fact.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King & Associates, Inc","Okay. Maybe this is a follow-up to that, I mean, would you anticipate that your economic arrangements you\u2019ve with your value-added distributors whether those will change materially next year compared to what you\u2019ve this year?","Jonathan Ayers","I think they\u2019ll be generally the same. We\u2019ll be in conversations with them about what the nature of -- what our relationship would look like next year, but I\u2019d say generally speaking that they will be quite similar to where they\u2019re today.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King & Associates, Inc","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. And good morning, guys. I guess the first one, Jon, just for clarity on the market, I think it was actually the third quarter in a row of deceleration in European CAG from ten to eight to five, and so can you just comment on what\u2019s going on over there? Are you starting to see some stability in the mid single-digit range or do you see continued deceleration there? And then if you can comment if that\u2019s really what\u2019s keeping your organic growth in check because [via] the Cornerstone data, it does look like we saw a nice sequential pickup in the U.S. market?","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, little bit more color on Europe. First of all, while we had a really great weather here in the U.S, they did not have so great. They had pretty bad weather in Europe. So I think that may have been a contributing factor.","We\u2019ve business across Europe. I think our northern parts of Europe are continuing to do quite well, including places like Germany where we\u2019ve significant business in the companion animal business, and France. The challenges are more in southern Europe as you\u2019d expect, Italy and Spain, but it\u2019s -- well anything, it\u2019s hard to predict. I think we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019ve got continued growth plans, we\u2019ve a great European country management and very established strategies to continue to grow the business. So I\u2019d not -- it\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in Europe generally, but I\u2019d be surprised if we had any further deceleration of growth especially given perhaps some of that was weather.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then, I try to adhere to the two question rule, but I guess like other\u2019s multi parts. So, on the distribution side of things, I just want to make sure I\u2019ve got this correct, it sounds like did the FTC sign off, because if you unwind one of your three distributors with the consolidation in this industry arguably 50% -- up to 70% of this markets could still be locked up. So can you comment \u2013 and the FTC essentially giving you a soft sign off on unwinding one of the distributors?","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, we of course would disagree with the notion that any part of the industry is locked up and one reason we say that is there have been a variety of ways to reach the market and our competitors have been quite successful in reaching the market with direct and other distribution channels. So this is only one of several ways to reach the market.","We -- as we understand it by moving to this generalist relationship with one of our three largest distributors where they don\u2019t \u2013 aren\u2019t subject to the competitive products policy and we would therefore of course expect them to carry competitive products along with our products addresses the FTC\u2019s concern, and we\u2019re committed to moving forward with that change and then I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re very, very confident that will be successful in that process.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And just a second part to that question, I guess, in terms of share shifts, whatever happens, it happens, but turning it back to the P&L, can you talk to arguably what you would see from legal on an annual basis? I mean when we look out to next year, what do you spend on legal from the FTC overhang in \u201811 or what would you expect in \u201912? And then I think Ross was going there, and I just didn\u2019t understand it, if you\u2019re one of the two distributors that remains exclusive to IDEXX, do you sort of have to sweeten this \u2013 the spot, give them a higher commission to keep the exclusivity? Thanks guys.","Jonathan Ayers","I missed the last question.","Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","In terms of what your \u2013 the payment to the distributors if you\u2019re staying exclusive, did you\u2019ve to give a bigger spread or sweetness spot in order to remain it to keep the exclusivity?","Jonathan Ayers","No, I really don\u2019t \u2013 actually I think the remaining distributors, IDEXX would actually become more valuable to them because they\u2019ve one less large distributor to content with as value-added. So I don\u2019t see that really at all possibility. I think the changes will probably be modest, if anything that might be slightly favorable to IDEXX. But we\u2019ll continue to invest in our strategic distributors. And of course with regard to economics, as we\u2019ve mentioned, because of the lower margin that the generalist would receive on IDEXX products because they\u2019ve moved away from being value-added. That\u2019s \u2013 we estimate to be $6 million to $12 million in resources that we can then reallocate to our sales, marketing customer support and support of our remaining value-added distributors.","So that\u2019s going to be a nice and that\u2019s incremental to our existing investments in that area. So that will be helpful to us to continue to serve customers and bring our innovations to the market. I\u2019ll have Merilee answer your question with regards to the legal spent.","Merilee Raines","Okay. Jon, we -- over the course of the last couple of years and through the first quarter of 2012, we\u2019ve spent about $5.5 million in legal expenses related to this investigation. And I think we\u2019re anticipating that until there is full resolution on this matter that we\u2019re going to continue to incur some legal spent, albeit we hope it will be at a lower rate. But we did spent, for instance in the first quarter, we spent about $0.5 million in legal.","Jonathan Ayers","(Technical Difficulty) thanks Jon. Okay, next question?","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. On the distribution update do you know what sort of time frame you\u2019ll be formalizing that decision with the FTC and I guess how that will be disclosed?","Jonathan Ayers","Yes. Well, our contracts with our distributors today are annual contracts, and they expire at the end of the year. We cannot unilaterally change one of these distributor contracts. So we\u2019d anticipate that this change would be put in place no later than when the contract \u2013 these three contracts expires, and we\u2019ve moved one of our distributors to this generalist approach. Should one of the distributors want to move more quickly to the generalist approach, we\u2019ll do that. So, that\u2019s why the timing is a little bit difficult to predict. And once we\u2019ve entered into that new relationship with that distributor in a way that we believe is responsive to the FTC\u2019s concerns, then we\u2019d anticipate that we\u2019d -- that the FTC would seek to have this modified agreement formalized in the form of a consent order.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. So we should probably hear that any sort of distribution agreement before we hear any sort of FTC, simultaneously?","Jonathan Ayers","I\u2019d say we probably hear about the change in the distribution agreement before we hear about the FTC, but it\u2019s -- what we believe is by having moved through this modified agreement with one of our three distributors, this does address the FTC\u2019s concerns.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Jonathan Ayers","So that\u2019s \u2013 so I think then we\u2019ve the FTC seek to formalize the modified agreement.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great, thanks. And on the Reference Laboratory side of the business, do you have the same store volume trends at all, if not specifically maybe directionally?","Merilee Raines","The same-store volume trends in the U.S. were about 3%.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And what portion of the overall lab growth was attributable to Consulting Services?","Jonathan Ayers","We\u2019ve to get that information for you, Erin.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, no, that\u2019s fine. Thank you.","Merilee Raines","Yeah, it was about $2.5 million.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Jonathan Ayers","Is the revenue or the growth?","Merilee Raines","Of the $101 million.","Jonathan Ayers","Yeah, so that\u2019s the total amount. So obviously it\u2019s a small piece of the total.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Hi. A couple of quick questions, first on just the distribution, I guess what if more than one wants to move to a generalist status, do you allow that or is it something that you think you can, I guess, sweeten so that only one decides to leave to a generalist mode?","Jonathan Ayers","Well, Nick, let me describe the generalist role and the economics, so I think you\u2019ve a better appreciation. The generalists would continue to provide veterinary customers with the IDEXX product line, of course, including taking customers orders and shipping kits and consumable out of their warehouse. They would not generally be expected to have any value-added focus from the distributor sales force as the nature of the relationship with IDEXX would have changed. The distributors, as we mentioned an important element here is the distributor \u2013 generalist distributor not be bound by a competitor product policy unless we would expect them to carry products competitive with IDEXX. The generalists also earn a margin on IDEXX products that\u2019s consistent with industry standards for this type of arrangement which is more in the single-digit range and substantially lower than the current margin that our distributors receive on our product today.","So that\u2019s a very significant element of the change, and so again we cannot predict how competitors react, how our distributors will reach, we have wonderful relationships with them. We\u2019ve worked with them closely in many cases over two decades and I think we're important to their business, they know our product-line very, very well, we've done years and years of training and of course it generates an important margin to them. So, they got to weigh that versus the opportunity to care competitive products.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Okay, and then just thinking about it, if one does specifically leave, you said about 5% to 8% of total revenue is under general \u2013 kind of under the generalist model. What level of perhaps if you wanted to frame potential sensitivity to the downside? What level of those revenues would you consider perhaps that risk that we should be thinking about as we model for \u201913? Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","So first of all when you say one of the distributors would leave, I\u2019d say, they\u2019re not going to leave us, they are going to move to the generalist model and continue to carry our products in this \u2013 in the form that I described. I\u2019d say absolutely zero, because we've got very, very strong relationships with our customers and so, I don\u2019t think any of the revenues would be at risk.","In addition Nick, I think its important to understand that in addition to our existing sales and marketing investments we would be adding another $6 million to $12 million of sales and marketing investments to grow our business. We would augment our budget by $6 million to $12 million that can be used for a variety of ways to support our growth strategy. So that\u2019s an offset to the move of one of our major distributors from value added if you will in the way the distributors are value added recognizing we sell our instruments direct and we have a direct sales force that works hand-in-glove with our distributors in things like 4Dx, the Plus launch. And then one thing I do want to say is, we will move one of our distributors to generalist, I mean that is not a question a bit, its just really a question of when and who.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then just lastly on just back to the base business, in terms of gross margin, I\u2019d have or just I\u2019d assume with the 9.6% consolidated organic revenue growth that we perhaps would have saw a little bit more, flow through to the bottom line. So, is there more investments this quarter in anticipation of kind of some of the exchanges or are we thinking about the less of the price realization that you saw was kind of an offset to that better organic volume growth? Thanks.","Merilee Raines","Yeah, I think Nick some of this is related to revenue mix and the fact, with businesses like Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics relatively high margin and I\u2019m showing the negative growth in the quarter, that \u2013 that\u2019s a factor, I mean, strong instrument sales, strong lab sales are carried. Again, these were all relatively lower gross margins and the Company average \u2013 are contributors there. We have stepped up investment a little bit in OpEx and I think that was \u2013 that\u2019s what reflected in our guidance as we went into the year and in our \u2026","Jonathan Ayers","Those are investments that really been in the area of on \u2013 product development \u2026","Merilee Raines","R&D, which \u2026","Jonathan Ayers","\u2026 R&D commercial, nothing in there in contemplation of this change since this was a relatively recent development.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Thank you very much. Great quarter, guys.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company. Please go ahead.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Do you guys consider weather trends completely transitory, or do you notice that warm weather really are in the year like we\u2019ve had this year in the U.S. at least, has some carry through throughout the remainder of the year?","Jonathan Ayers","Its really hard to call. I will say that everybody is talking about it being a pretty big flea and tick season, because of the fact that was a warmer winter and the fleas and ticks generally survived the winter better than they would have it was a really bad winter. But on the other hand, that could then pull forward of the annual visits into the first quarter from the second quarter kind of like some of the speculation we\u2019ve seen in general with retail sales. And so we think it\u2019s a good development. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a net neutral, but its we will just have to see how the carry through happen.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay, sure. And then just one housekeeping one. What was depreciation and amortization during the quarter?","Merilee Raines","That \u2013 just bear with me for a second.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","No problem.","Merilee Raines","Okay. That was about $12.8 million.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","$12.8 million. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Your line is open.","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company LLC","Yes, good morning. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned this already. I just had a quick question. Again, if you had any specific criteria as you look to select a distributor in terms of the generalist approach?","Jonathan Ayers","I think the criteria that we\u2019re going to be select, using is \u2013 this is the \u2013 it is to select which of our three distributors would be continuing in a value added approach. And we\u2019re going to go through that process, working very closely with distributors, they\u2019ve all been long standing excellent distributors for us. We\u2019re going to see who really best meets our strategic needs based on their track record among a variety of factors. Their commitment to the IDEXX line and a lot of other factors we plan to conduct a fair and transparent process with our distributors and making this evaluation on which of our distributors would be continuing in a value added mode.","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company LLC","Thanks again.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova with Leerink Swann. Please go ahead.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I do have a quick one. I appreciate that Jon that you mentioned, you don\u2019t expect any impact from change in agreements, but just to get a perspective and sorry if I miss that, what is the percent \u2013 of the 20% of revenues that goes through distributors? How much of this is the big three \u2013 how much is value added and how much is the big three?","Jonathan Ayers","Well, we\u2019ve said that, its majority, but certainly not all of it. And we\u2019ve said that the move of one of the big three to generalist would be somewhere between depending on which one, 5% to 8% of the 20%, if you will. So, they\u2019re \u2013 you can kind of \u2013 I think they gives you \u2013 I think that answers your question as to well. So that \u2013 if you divide 5% to 8% by 20% you get 25% to 40% of the U.S. volume that goes through \u2013 that goes to the distributors, would be involved with one of the moves. But I do want to say that our distributors are an important part of the equation. But we have \u2013 if we are talking about instruments and consumables, we sell our instruments directly. Distributors are sometimes helpful in that process on \u2013 less than the half the time, but we know where the market opportunities are as a result of our market knowledge. It\u2019s our direct sales force that closes the instruments and you can similarly on rapid assay. The vast majority of our rapid assay are highly differentiated, important products that really don\u2019t have an alternative in the market. And we work with a combination of our direct sales force and our distributors in order to expand the adoption of these unique value added offerings.","Let\u2019s take 4Dx and 4Dx Plus as an example. There is nothing else on the market that is a comprehensive tick-borne disease screening test combined with a Heartworm test let along one that has over 60 papers and 10 years of clinical data behind it. And so we really see this as a refinement. We don\u2019t \u2013 its not like customers are going to move away from 4Dx because they got a relationship with IDEXX as much as they even probably \u2013 even more so than that they have a relation with the distributors. The distributor is helpful to the equation, they provide the product, their reps are -- work hand in glove with our direct sales force. But it is \u2013 we also have a direct sales model in a highly differentiated product offering and an instrument install base which were all considerations and thinking about IDEXX\u2019s growth with this refinement.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you, Jonathan.","Jonathan Ayers","Thank you very much.","Operator","And with that, Mr. Ayers, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you.","Jonathan Ayers","Okay. I want to thank everybody for being on the call. We\u2019re very excited about our prospects for the year. We\u2019re very excited about our innovation agenda. We really do believe that we\u2019re at \u2013 the industry itself and us at the lead had an inflexion point, were veterinarian\u2019s are now beginning to appreciate that they can impact on practice visits with their own practice management and marketing. In the same way probably, dentists figured this out that keeps a go. And that variance are kind of were dentists were decades ago.","So there is a big opportunity here because we know the pet owner responds, when the veterinarian is able to communicate the value of the care that they can provide. We see that in individual cases and so we\u2019re excited with the launch of our new menu, including 4Dx Plus and Phenobarbitol on Catalyst Dx\u00ae and we\u2019re very excited about the partners in wellness with PurinaCare and it\u2019s a big deal, the VetConnect PLUS announcement is another significant value added piece that comes with whether you got IDEXX in-house or reference lab or both, a real value added piece. And we think VetConnect PLUS is going to actually be a platform for some additional opportunities in the future, in the same way that five years ago when we launched smart service that became the platform for a lot of new things and indeed one of them \u2013 those new things was the launch of VetConnect PLUS.","So we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity for growth and our innovation agenda and we really appreciate the attention and the confidence that our investor base has and of course we really want to thank all of our employees who continue to work hard to bring the value to the customer in a economically attractive way.

McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued high growth and excellent financial results in Q2, building on our strong start to 2018. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $581 million grew 14% on a reported basis, driven by consistent 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument placements and favorable year-on-year foreign exchange changes.","EPS was $1.23 per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable constant currency basis. These results reflect strong revenue growth, related operating expense leverage, which drove a 110 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins, and net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.","In terms of our outlook, we're raising our full year organic growth outlook to 11.5% to 12.5% and refining our full year revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.230 billion. The reported revenue outlook is down $7.5 million at the midpoint compared to our earlier guidance as operational upsides are offset by $20 million to $25 million of negative impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","We're raising our 2018 EPS outlook by $0.02 at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20, or 32% to 36% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. At the midpoint of our guidance range, this new outlook builds in approximately $0.07 per share of full year operational benefit related to our raised organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement, incorporating benefits from our strong first half performance.","This outlook also factors in additional investments we're advancing in our global commercial capabilities, which we'll discuss in more detail today. We're also projecting $0.02 in full year EPS benefit related to a lower effective tax rate, including additional tax benefit related to stock compensation activity. These increases more than offset a negative $0.07 per share impact from our updated FX assumptions, net of hedges.","We'll review our updated 2018 outlook in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region.","Strong Q2 results were driven by continued momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $507 million, up 13% organically, reflecting strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued solid growth in our software, services and diagnostic imaging system businesses. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased over 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% growth rate benefit from revenue accounting standard changes primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement.","Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software, services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business, driven by a 16% overall increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements, including a 49% increase in high-end digital radiography system installations.","Our Water business revenues grew 9% organically in the second quarter to $33 million, reflecting continued high single-digit growth in the U.S., augmented by strong gains in Asia and Latin America.","Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $35 million, or flat organically. Growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues in the U.S., Europe and Latin America was offset by lower revenues in Asia related to continued soft end-market conditions, including impact from lower milk prices globally.","By region, U.S. revenues were $357 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by a 12% increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth in U.S. reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales.","U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume-driven with price gains trending in the 2% range overall. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics are sustaining at very high levels, supporting our continued strong U.S. growth profile.","IDEXX's U.S. recurring CAG growth performance outpaced solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our data set from approximately 7,500 clinics. In Q2, patient visits were up 1.5% and clinic revenues increased 5.7% compared to the prior-year period.","International revenues in Q2 were $224 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 15% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected very high consumable revenue gains, over 20% year-on-year in the quarter, supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base, increasing chemistry utilization and new test adoption. We also saw continued solid gains in European lab revenues in Q2.","In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results were supported by global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and rapid expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally, we placed 3,241 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior-year levels, reflecting 11% growth in North America and 30% gains in international markets. These results were driven by 1,651 Catalyst placements, a 39% year-on-year increase, and continued strong momentum in SediVue with 716 placements in the quarter.","Since our launch in early 2016, we've now installed over 5,200 SediVues globally. We also placed 874 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,344 SNAP Pros in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 21,500 with nearly 20,000 installed in North America.","Strong Catalyst performance in Q2 was supported by 1,200 placements in international markets, up 55% year-on-year, reflecting significant progress in upgrading our VetTest installed base and strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. Globally, we placed 784 Catalysts at new or competitive accounts in the quarter, up 14% year-on-year. Consistent with our strategic focus, 346 instruments or 77% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts.","Our EVI index for premium instruments was up solidly in North America in Q2, supported by Catalyst gains and 32% year-on-year growth in SediVue placements, both benefiting from our multi-modality IDEXX 360 program, which continues to gain traction with customers. The use of EVI is also sharpening our focus in the international market, supporting the outstanding Catalyst placement growth results in the quarter.","CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 were $35 million, up 22% organically, including $9 million of revenues attributed to the accounting standard change, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. Consistent with our first quarter results, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S.","Benefits from an expanding instrument base, the innovation that we brought to market in recent years and our expanded direct commercial capability continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains.","Instrument consumable revenues of $159 million grew 18% organically in Q2. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across U.S. and international markets. Adoption of our greenfield innovation continues to build with SediVue and SDMA-on-a-slide each contributing approximately 2% to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.","Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $197 million grew 13% organically in the second quarter. U.S. lab momentum is very strong, reflected in continued mid-teen volume-driven organic reference lab revenue gains and record high customer retention levels, now over 97%. We also achieved continued high single-digit organic lab growth in international markets, supported by higher gains in Europe.","Rapid assay revenues of $63 million grew 4% organically in Q2 with similar gains in U.S. and international markets. Solid rapid assay growth was driven by continued expansion of 4Dx Plus, specialty and first generation products.","Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $146 million, up 19% as reported or 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 25.1%, up 110 basis points on a constant currency basis, aided by operating expense leverage on our strong revenue growth results in the quarter. Relative to our expectations, we saw some favorability related to timing of OpEx investments, which supported our strong Q2 operating margins. These benefits are reflected in our raised full year operating margin guidance.","Gross profit was $332 million in Q2, up 14% as reported or 12% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 57.2% decreased 35 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to strong prior-year levels, including about 20 basis points of impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue.","Higher investments in lab information systems and service capacity, employee benefits including the increase in our 401(k) match levels as part of the tax reform reinvestment, as well as mix impacts from high instrument revenue growth offset benefits from solid net price gains and ongoing productivity improvement. Foreign exchange hedge losses, which impact gross profit, were approximately $1 million in Q2.","Looking forward, we anticipate relatively more favorable benefits from gross margin leverage in the second half of this year as we lap stepped-up investments in areas like U.S. lab route capacity advanced in the second half of 2017.","Operating expenses in Q2 were up 10% or 7.5% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 140 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales and marketing and R&D investment, offset in part by the lab cost reclass.","As noted in our press release, we're advancing incremental investments in commercial capability in the U.S. and international markets, which will increase the year-on-year growth in operating expenses in the second half of 2018. These investments are factored into our increased full year operating margin improvement goals.","EPS in Q2 was $1.23 per share, including $4 million or $0.05 per share in tax benefits related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 33%, including net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.","Our effective tax rate was 20.9% in Q2, including 3% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts, in Q2 2017 and 2018 increased operating profits by $2 million and EPS by $0.02 per share. Free cash flow was $102 million for the first half of 2018.","We continue to maintain our full year outlook for capital spending at about $140 million. This outlook includes about $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation, or about 15% of net income.","We're now expecting free cash flow of approximately 70% to 75% of net income for 2018, reflecting these investments, and additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements. These program instrument outlays are directly related to supporting the expansion of our highly durable CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and yield high incremental returns on invested capital.","We allocated $106 million in capital to the repurchase of 500,000 shares in Q2. Year-to-date, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $195 per share while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.043 billion in debt, $175 million in cash and $412 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility.","Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.84 times gross and 1.53 times net of cash. We're refining our 2018 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases to about 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We now project annual net interest expense of approximately $35 million, at the lower end of our earlier outlook, reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization.","In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full year reported revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.230 billion. This incorporates operational upsides from our higher 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth outlook, including raised expectations for 12.5% to 14% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and flow-through benefits from our strong first half performance in growing premium instrument placements.","As noted, these benefits largely offset $20 million to $25 million of negative revenue guidance impact from revised FX assumptions for the year related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. At the revised conversion rate assumptions shown in our press release, we now expect a full year revenue growth benefit of approximately 0.5% to 1% from FX with a 2% reported revenue growth headwind in the second half of 2018.","We're raising our 2018 full year EPS guidance by $0.02 per share at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, reflecting an outlook for 32% to 36% comparable constant currency EPS growth. As noted, our updated EPS outlook incorporates approximately $0.07 in operational upside related to our higher organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement.","Our EPS guidance assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of 19% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.02 of EPS upside. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of $16.5 million to $18.5 million or approximately 4% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.20 per share in full year benefit.","FX impacts align with the foreign exchange rate shown in our press release partially offset these increases to our full year EPS guidance. We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will have a $0.01 positive impact on full year EPS or about $0.07 per share below our earlier estimates. Consistent with these assumptions, we estimate net hedge gains and losses will be relatively flat for the full year.","In terms of our third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, supported by organic revenue gains of 11.5% to 13%. We expect Q3 2018 operating margins to increase approximately 100 basis points above prior-year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis as we ramp our commercial investments.","In terms of FX impacts, in addition to a projected 2% revenue growth headwind, we expect year-on-year FX changes will have a modest negative impact on reported operating margins in Q3. So the reported operating margin improvement will be somewhat below the 100 basis points I noted. We expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be 19% to 20%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity.","That concludes the financial review. Overall, our business momentum is very strong and we're on track to significantly over-deliver against our original goals for 2018 financial performance.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Brian, thanks. Let me put those great results in context here. Our strategy is to help veterinarians around the world to grow their appropriate use of diagnostics in the care of the pet, keeping pets healthy and meeting the needs of owners. The current medical standards practice today broadly define a fraction of what they could be with IDEXX's unique toolkit of tests and services assisted by software technologies.","In the second quarter, our commercial teams around the world made great progress advancing our strategy, as evidenced by the record Q2 instrument placements and the 13% organic growth in the testing that make up our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenues.","Commercial successes driven by field presence and ever-growing field productivity drove the results that Brian enumerated. The productivity drivers include our EVI, or economic value index, basis for instrument placements, which has now been adopted globally in 2018; our IDEXX 360 program to grow IDEXX proprietary diagnostics; and our investments in sales force automation.","Our advanced CRM helps our field professionals answer the three key questions they face every day: Where do I go? Who do I see? And what do I say? The extensive proprietary real-time data we have integrated into our CRM, Salesforce.com, empowers our consultants to be highly relevant to our customers in supporting their adoption of IDEXX innovations and advancing their practices.","Our IDEXX 3 (sic) [IDEXX 360] (20:41) program has already shown significant successes in the North American market, evidenced by the second quarter performance of 346 Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts and 650 SediVue placements, up 32% year-over-year. We will be implementing the IDEXX 360 program in major international markets over the next six months. We expect this customer-friendly program will advance instrument placements further and support the enduring growth of IDEXX's diagnostic recurring revenues.","A key feature of IDEXX 360 is that the customer can meet their diagnostic growth commitments by testing where they want; in-house or reference labs; and what they want. In addition, customers' adoptions of IDEXX's new and unique test further support their revenue commitments to IDEXX, while growing the adoption of these unique test innovations.","Our success' momentum and increasing productivity of our sales and marketing team combined with the market opportunity of our unique offering gives us confidence to expand our commercial presence yet again in the second half of 2018. In the U.S., we are already underway with 13% expansion in our field-based professionals, which we expect to be fully in place and in territory by the beginning of Q4 2018. This will bring us to an estimated 490 field-based professionals, up from 435 in Q1.","When we expand our presence in the field, each IDEXX professional is able to spend more time with each customer and, thus, our relationships with each customer deepens further. We have consistently found quite simply the more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. We also know customers who use IDEXX for their in-house and reference labs are larger and grow their revenues faster than practices who do not use IDEXX for either. So, the deeper presence will help us with instrument placements, including the novel SediVue Dx for urinalysis, grow usage of our proprietary assays and technologies, such as SDMA and VetConnect PLUS, increase customer loyalty and retention, and support the growth of IDEXX's unique strategy to advance preventative care testing at the reference lab, what we call the Preventative Care Challenge, leveraging IDEXX's unique expanded test menu.","Note that we are pleased to see over 20,000 U.S. customers now use IDEXX reference labs, an all-time high, in Q2 of 2018, a level never achieved before in this most basic metric of IDEXX market presence. Our successes outside the U.S. market have led us to the same conclusion. There is a strong ROI for IDEXX when we invest in a disciplined expansion of our field professional presence. And so, in the second half of 2018, we are embarking on growth in our field presence in targeted country markets where we see the greatest opportunity. These expansions range from 20% to 100% in field-based professionals depending on the targeted country.","Overall, outside the U.S., we are planning to increase our field-based presence to 390 professionals, up 15% from 340 at the end of 2017. This does not include increases in supporting personnel, including phone-based and marketing staff. So, in total, our global field-based presence with professionals in the field who are experts in diagnostics and software supporting our customers will be an estimated 880 by the end of 2018.","Internationally, we've also been moving our sales structures to customer-centric model, similar to the one we put in place in North America a few years ago and to great effect. Key markets where we have a strong in-house and reference lab with a direct sales approach, such as Australia, Japan, the Nordics and Germany have already moved to this structure over the past couple of years.","Germany in its second quarter in the new structure saw very strong instrument placements with Catalyst placements up 75% year-over-year and strong reference lab organic growth. The UK will move to this account model at the beginning of 2019, the last major market to do so within the IDEXX international portfolio.","These initiatives will help us further develop the unique innovations that we have brought to the market in the last two to four years, which cumulatively have created a highly differentiated portfolio of instruments, rapid assays and reference lab services.","The 13% growth that we are achieving is coming primarily from the core portfolio of tests and services that make up our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenues, with smaller benefits from new products launched within the last 12 months. These smaller products contributed about 0.5% to organic growth in Q4. This momentum, augmented with our expanded global commercial presence, gives us high confidence we can sustain high growth in the Companion Animal Group recurring revenues as we move forward.","We'd like to provide an update on our new test innovations. In July, we have launched the Catalyst SDMA T4 combo kit in North America, which follows earlier launches of Catalyst CRP and Catalyst SDMA contributing to the growing IDEXX proprietary in-house testing menu. Most of the international markets will follow with the SDMA T4 combo kit launch within the next two months. This test innovation will further advance SDMA adoption on Catalyst as well as grow T4 utilization with all the benefits to customer retention, new customer acquisition, consumable revenue growth per customer that we have discussed in the past.","Looking forward, we are reassessing our SNAP Fecal product currently in development. We believe we have more work to do than initially appreciated to bring a fecal SNAP to the field with the level of outstanding sensitivity and specificity that we are currently able to deliver with the reference lab Fecal Dx offering. At this time, we're not in a position to provide a targeted launch date. We don't anticipate this change will impact either our 2018 or 2019 revenue growth plans, given the large number of current growth drivers already in play in our North American Companion Animal Group commercial operations.","Our commercial focus in the fecal testing category will be building on the tremendous success we are experiencing with our proprietary fecal antigen reference lab offering, Fecal Dx. Our unique technology for both routine and sick animal intestinal parasite screening and testing in our reference lab offering finds more disease and finds it earlier in the infection cycle than just the traditional microscopy approach.","Fecal Dx is also a key piece of our proprietary Preventative Care Challenge that is appropriate for all life stages of the dog and cat. Combined with Lab 4Dx, a chemistry panel with an IDEXX SDMA and the unique aspects of the IDEXX CBC, we have assembled a comprehensive screen for the seemingly well patient to uncover underlying diseases that are impacting pet health and well-being and which can be addressed with a treatment plan.","We're finding that advancing the appropriate case for preventative care testing using IDEXX proprietary panels in the reference labs is a long-term growth driver for the reference lab volumes in our existing customers in the U.S. The Preventative Care Challenge really defines what IDEXX is all about: serving the pet, pet owner and veterinarian alike.","We also continue to add to our capability in providing solutions to veterinary practices to support the management of their business. Of note, our veterinary software and services business has just gotten stronger with the recent acquisition of Smart Flow just after the quarter ended. Virtually every paper formed in the veterinary practice can be captured electronically using Smart Flow, enabling a truly paperless practice and, importantly, ensuring all service charges are captured and added to the invoice, improving both practice efficiency and revenue and profitability.","Smart Flow is a very innovative treatment workflow enhancement to the core practice management software system, such as Cornerstone, and provide a high ROI due to its impact on productivity and the plugging of revenue leaks from hospital charges not captured.","Quite similar to what IDEXX has done with diagnostic integration in VetConnect PLUS, Smart Flow also enhances IDEXX's overall software offering to our customers who need enterprise IT solutions. Practices with enterprise needs currently consist of about 10% to 15% of the global market.","Wrapping up, the market, our strategy and our execution in the field is driving strong growth in our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue with Q2 organic growth of 13%. These recurring revenues contribute an estimated 75% of our overall IDEXX revenue, so a core enduring growth driver. We are advancing a software strategy that builds on key elements of our strategy to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. Our raised organic growth for 2018 is reflective of strong momentum we are building in our businesses, position us to continue to deliver on our long-term revenue and profit goals.","So, in summary, all of us at IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose \u2013 to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.","And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Question will come from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the call. A couple of quick questions. One, I just wanted a little more clarity on what you just talked about, Jon, with fecal SNAP. You mentioned previously it was expected in the summer of 2018 and on the last call, you said it was more about workflow and some of the earlier response you got from the early users on just optimizing the workflow. So I want to get a little bit more clarity on what has changed since then and why this additional change to the fecal.","And then a quick follow-up on the sales force expansion. You highlighted some of the international markets you're going. But in the United States, for example, is there any territory reshuffling associated with this or is this more just in each territory additional sales force and also timing on how long you expect for those to get up to speed, three, six months things like that?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. On the fecal offering, we've been so successful with the proprietary antigen-based technology in the reference lab, combining it with core blood work, IDEXX Chemistry with SDMA and CBC. And that fecal offering is going to \u2013 it's an outstanding level of sensitivity and specificity. And by the way, it's going to advance further when we adopt the Applied BioCode, which is the technology we announced earlier in 2018. And so, in that context, we are continuing to evaluate the customer requirements we need for an in-house screening test for SNAP.","And you heard all the investments that Brian mentioned that we're \u2013 in expanding our reference lab, our presence, our information systems and the field expansion, we're really going to be focusing on the reference lab side of the fecal testing in 2019. And as I mentioned, that wasn't a product that was even planned until 2019 and we don't think the change in our outlook here changes, of course, either 2018 or 2019 growth prospects.","With regard to the U.S. expansion, we've already actually hired the majority of the people as of now, as part of that expansion and they're in training and in the field. There's always a small reconfiguration of the territories when you do an expansion by definition because we're adding more territories. That will take place in Q4. Typically, it takes a quarter for everything to get up to speed, but we have so much momentum and obviously we have a lot of supporting people in those territories, our veterinary diagnostic specialists, the instrument specialists, the professional service veterinarians that we \u2013 and this is the third \u2013 actually, this is the third expansion of this nature that we have done. So we're really down the learning curve on how to do this smoothly with the field. So that's going to be fully in place towards the end of the year and obviously preparing for 2019.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Appreciate it. Look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, seems like an important data point is the upped investment internationally with growing the customer-facing organization. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? Is that increased demand for diagnostics that you're seeing opening up the market? Is it the company's success rolling out EVI or 360 that gives you the comfort? Or is it investment ahead of potential competitors maybe increasing their investments in the market? Just what's really driving that because it seems like a pretty big uptick?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you very much. We're very, very excited about the international expansion. And you're right, that is a new data point on the call and noteworthy that we're talking about and it's really the fact that we've had just tremendous success internationally with our instrument business, Catalyst placements outside of North America up 55% in the second quarter. And we've only started to achieve the benefits of EVI. We haven't even started with IDEXX 360. And we're really early days on leveraging the productivity benefits of sales force automation, all of which working together increases the productivity of our investment. And so given the market opportunity that we've laid out in past discussions and we'll reinforce in the Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we just see the opportunity to be significant.","The other point I will make is that we've launched SDMA for Catalyst internationally in the second quarter and it's unbelievable what the take-up is. We have 50% of Catalyst customers outside the U.S. who purchased the SDMA slide. This is amazing because we've only been in the market a couple months. It's faster take-up in the U.S. I think these international markets, our teams have done a great job and they're more medically-centric, believe it or not, than the U.S. and we don't even have reference labs in a lot of these \u2013 in some of these markets that we've seen SDMA pick-up or a strong reference lab presence. And so the proprietary nature of our offering, once we get a Catalyst into a customer \u2013 the loyalty of our Catalyst customers outside the U.S. is 99.9% and so we really see the opportunity to double down on growth in these markets around the world.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And given that it is a novel data point, just want to get a little bit more of a reference here. Is the 15% uptick in the customer-facing organization OUS, incremental to what you started with at the start of the year? Or did you have some plans to grow that and now it's higher and you're just talking about this 15% as an overall growth metric? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes. It is incremental to what we had as our plan going into 2018 and it's really reflective of the exceptional performance that our teams have achieved, the maturity of our management teams and supporting functions. These are disciplined expansions. We don't do these things willy-nilly. We want to do them right. We want to do them in a way that our customers benefit and our organization in an organized fashion. We know how to do this. We've done more of these expansions in the U.S., but we're prepared to take this kind of growth mentality \u2013 augmented growth mentality internationally. So, yeah, this is something that we really \u2013 it was not part of our plans going into 2018, but we feel the ROI is there and that's characteristic of IDEXX. We move very, very fast when we see new opportunities.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, just on the return point, if you look at the incremental growth that we're able to drive as well as the durability of these revenues, the inverse of a 99% retention rate is a very long customer relationship. The return on these investments is several times what we're putting into it. And I think with the 55% instrument growth, over 20% consumable growth, we're really encouraged by the momentum that we have and think this is a great place for us to be spending our time and our resources.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","There's another interesting dynamic, Ryan, on top of everything we're talking about, what we've done in the U.S., we basically upgraded all the VetTests to Catalyst, okay? There is like less than \u2013 I think over 99% of our chemistry consumable revenue in the U.S. is now coming from Catalyst customers. In large part, we aren't as far along, but we're well on our way. 80%, 85% of our chemistry consumable outside the U.S. is coming from Catalyst customers.","And so while we continue to upgrade VetTest, we're actually turning our forces towards the new and competitive placements. And we don't have to spend as much time upgrading vet tests because, quite frankly, there are not that many left, and usually they're smaller, they're harder to upgrade. And so we take the same resources and turn them to new and competitive and, of course, that accelerates the consumable growth, which is why we're getting over 20% consumable growth in the international markets in Q2 because we've really turned now to the new and competitive. So it's another reason why we feel good about augmenting our sales organization.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. Can you speak to some of the more one-time factors impacting the gross margin in the quarter and the dynamics that are influencing that potential or potentially better trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess, can you speak to the overall price realization in the quarter and the sustainability of pricing trends in general across reference laboratory, rapid assay as well as VetLab consumables? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Sure. Why don't I start with price, Erin? We noted we were at a 2% net price increase in the quarter. It's very consistent with the strategy that we've been advancing. Not a lot of change on that front. I would say, if anything, at the margin, we're just doing really well with new customer acquisition. And so that's a growth-oriented investment that causes a little bit of moderation in the gross to net conversion, but that will come back over time, of course, as we secure those accounts and get the benefits of growth with them over time.","In terms of the gross margin dynamics, there are a number of investments that have been flowing through cost of revenue in the first half. Late last year, we really stepped up some investments in our lab route capacity given the mid-teen volume growth that we were seeing in our U.S. labs. We're rolling out and completing the rollout of our global LIMS system implementations that also flows through cost of revenue. We added capacity to our software, services field service rep organization and we had some cost reclassifications.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, 20 basis points of cost reclass.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That we talked about. And so along with the strong instrument growth, it's all kind of flowing through gross margin at the moment. As we look ahead, we'll start lapping some of those investments, particularly the route capacity and the lab information systems will be moderating in terms of their growth. And so looking ahead to the back half, I made a comment that we'll have more favorable comparison, so our increased operating margin outlook factors that in even as we're advancing these incremental commercial investments.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, the sequential step-up in practice revenue and patient visit growth that you noted based on the metrics you track, I guess, do you think that there was any delay in the flea and tick season that possibly impacted overall visits and influencing your consumables or reference laboratory volume? I guess, what's embedded in your guidance also in terms of that underlying veterinary demand trends in the U.S. in particular and potentially what you saw over the course of the quarter? Thanks","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. I think with regard to our performance, we're not as dependent on the flea and tick season as maybe other companies that are serving the industry with different categories, but I think it was a slow start to the year, that was probably weather. I think most people said April was a weird month and then May and June were good months. And it's hard to parse this by month, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about that, but I think the market is strong. And, as you know, Erin, people love their pets, millennials love their pets even better and it turns out Generation Z may even be beyond millennials. So millennials are moving into their own homes and first thing that comes is a pet. So, they're getting married later, having kids later, but they're getting the pet.","So I think the overall market is strong. I think our customer base, those who are using IDEXX and who are regularly working with IDEXX that we're finding this preventative care is a big growth driver and that's one of the things that is driving particularly our reference lab growth in the first half of the year.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning. Maybe two and change in terms of questions. Jon, you detailed the actual head count associated with the recent expansion. Where is the approximate U.S. call cycle after this most recent expansion of the sales force? And then, what's the optimal call cycle as you see it after factoring in your level of innovation?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Jon, we get that question all the time. The more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. And because the adoption of our innovations is still a fraction of what it could be, the adoption of preventative care is still just really the earliest stages. And the other thing is we are really starting to see huge productivity from our CRM at Salesforce.com. It's pretty impressive. A rep can now basically quickly sort their territory by any number of metrics, for example, adoptions of what customers have purchased SDMA-on-a-slide. And they can sort it and pick the top opportunities, drop it right in the map anything and they got two days of calls on that particular topic. And it's really powerful and it's used by the entire sales management team.","That is really \u2013 what we've been doing is building the infrastructure and now we're starting to see the real benefit. So we're going to \u2013 this expansion allows us to make more calls on customers and we expect a good ROI. It's hard for me to say where is the end of this because we're all about advancing the standards of care and that's what we see as the opportunity. And the most mature market in the world, the U.S., is not mature at all. And then we look outside the U.S. and we say if the international market got to the U.S. standard of care, I mean, what would it take? And it turns out it would take 25 years of 10% organic revenue growth to get the U.S. standards of care. And, of course, the U.S. isn't standing still. So, yeah, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and this is going to increase the call intensity with our customers.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Just to try to quantify a bit, are you some, call it, once a month in terms of your U.S. sales force on how frequently they're currently calling on your customers?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Well, remember, we call customers, everybody out there, whether they're using us or not. Now, most practices use us for something, but not all. So we're calling on them, whether they're using us or not. And I'd say once a month is \u2013 we're going to have some more of those metrics. It's hard to say. Obviously, the big customers that we're calling on far more frequently than once a month and we're calling more than just with the veterinary diagnostic consultant. We've got professional service veterinarians and we've got specialists and we've now got, Brian mentioned as part of the gross margin factor, the investments we're making with field-based, field support reps who help them with their software and this is highly appreciating our customers who have adopted our PIMS and our apps are larger and more loyal and growing faster. And so, yeah, there's a lot of working with the customers and they really appreciate our presence because we're really bringing subject matter expertise.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'm not trying to be difficult, but let me ask one more just to be clear, this is still part of the first question. You made a lot of hires. I guess, what I'm trying to get at, by the numbers, it seems like you are calling on much more than once a month. I understand your growth has been highly, highly impressive, but I think what we're all trying to figure out is, is there a point in time where this at least goes a little bit more on auto pilot rather than handholding. So, Jon, just to try get the crux of the question, if you're now at \u2013 I think it was close to 600 reps in North America, what is peak number? Is it 700? Is it 1,200? Is it somewhere in between? Can you give us some context there? And then I promise I'll move on to part two.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I guess, the question is, what is peak growth? We keep accelerating our growth. So we can spend some more time on this on the Analyst Day.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. The second question is really following up on SNAP Fecal. And I know you talked about the pipeline being very robust despite the setback in SNAP Fecal. But a couple of questions here. So, one, I wanted to be clear. Is this product still likely coming to market at some point? I don't think I really knew. And then the $15 million in incremental revenue that I think was supposed to be derived from SNAP Fecal, that could have been 100 to 200 basis points of incremental growth depending on the cadence of those revenues. So what was the point earlier in the call that you're going to find ways to make up some, most, or all of that through the traction that you have at the reference lab? Thanks, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, that is our expectation.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That was pretty tight. So I'll ask the last 0.5. With this product seemingly unlikely to hit the market in 2019, a big part of the IDEXX story has been a continual cadence of new products. Should we expect this to be replaced by something else that you may have in the pipeline next year? Thanks, guys. And I'll see you in a couple weeks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We're going to bring more products to the market next year. They are all different types and sizes and we'll have more to say when we get closer to 2019. I do want to say, though, what we're really benefiting from is the cumulative effect of the advancements in our proprietary test portfolio. And while everybody loves new products, we've got so many new products and so many proprietary advances out there that are still early in the adoption and which bring along all the other diagnostic recurring revenue that the vast majority of our growth is the core growth that comes from the cumulative technology we've brought to the market over the last several years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you very much. You reported outstanding consumables growth of 20%. This appears to be the strongest I've seen in a long time. And I guess, Brian, for you, I think you indicated that both SediVue and SDMA in a slide added I believe 2 points to consumable growth in the quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","That's right.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So that's clarified. And then as we think about \u2013 I know you're not prepared to guide 2019. These products are certainly very early. Should we be thinking about these products as potentially 2 points additive into 2019 as we think about next year?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So a couple clarifications. Our organic growth in consumables globally was 18%. It was over 20% internationally. These are long adoption cycles. So these products will continue to augment consumable growth in 2019.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think the way to think about it is consistent to how we've talked in our long-term strategic plan where we highlighted a long-term potential for 9% to 13% recurring CAG growth and we're obviously at the high end of that range right now and incorporated in that were benefits from SDMA, SediVue, other new products, including fecal antigen in labs and which I believe was \u2013 I think we had 0.5 point to 1 point in total from fecal antigen. So these are things that build over time and they all go into the mix.","And as Jon pointed out, combined with our commercial approaches and integrated strategy to hitting those growth numbers. So we're not trying to signal that we are adding to that long-term growth potential. We'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but I think we're executing quite well and at the high end of what we've been targeting to achieve and we think with the additional investments we're making, we're looking to build on that momentum and sustain that into the future.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then last quarter you indicated that 42% of your Catalyst installed base had adopted SDMA-on-a-slide. Do you have an updated number on that? And then I think you were hoping to get to maybe somewhere around 60% of your installed base at the end of the year. Is that still maybe on track?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you for that question. The 42% was a U.S. number because we really hadn't launched it internationally. We're right now at 50% globally, which \u2013 sorry, almost 50% \u2013 49% globally. And so we're pretty happy with what the international did. I mean, international is like at 50% and U.S. is at 48%. That averages 49%. So we're really pleased with the progress at this point in the year.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's great. And maybe one last quick one. Certainly, a very strong quarter highlighted by organic revenue growth that beat our forecast. Just wanted to ask on the rapid assay piece. Obviously, you do have a competitor on the market in the FLEX4 from Abaxis-Zoetis. Can you just speak to your view on what the pro forma growth rate of that market is? Is that mid-single-digits, high-single-digits? Or can you talk about any competitive dynamics there?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, we achieved a little higher than 5% \u2013 I think we were at 6% in Q1 and 4% organic growth in Q2 in our rapid assay business, which, as you know, is predominantly a North American business, a U.S. business. So that was both in volume and price. There was a new test out there. Always a new test generates some interest. I think the bloom is off the rose on that right now because I think customers appreciate the accuracy and sensitivity of our test. And by the way, that's the reason why you buy these tests and run them is so they find the disease. And when they don't find, customers are realizing, it's pretty obvious, it's not capturing a lot of the disease that the 4Dx is. And so we had to work through that. We're working through that, educating customers every step of the way, and so there was some impact on that certainly in our numbers in the second quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Consistent with what we had baked into our plans this year.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. Look forward to the Analyst Day.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. So really excited about the adoption of SDMA in the clinic. Now, I know that no customer is unique and you're going to probably see across the board kind of behaviors. But can you kind of give us a sense on how your customers are adopting? Kind of what percentage of chemistry panels are they adopting, if you can give us that? Or if you can't, maybe can you just give us some anecdotes about how they're using it right now? Just anything right now is helpful in understanding how quick that's going to be adopted.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you very much. It's a great question. So customers are at all different stages of the journey to belief and understanding of the immense clinical value that SDMA adds to a chemistry panel. We have several hundred customers in the U.S. who are well along that journey and including SDMA and the large majority of their panels are running SDMA at a large percentage of what they're running core chemistry panels.","But we've got a lot more Catalyst customers than that. So there are people that are partway there, there are people that are just starting that journey. And so this is a change in established doctrine over 50 years. We've made a lot of progress with the reference lab. But I think the availability of Catalyst SDMA is bringing new excitement and I think we're seeing more and more customers, as they get experience with SDMA, they realize it's an essential element of the chemistry panel.","We're going to show some really interesting data, some of our big data on the impact that SDMA has at the Analyst Day, David, which I think you'll all find interesting. And this is why we're expanding our field resources because we've got to bring that story to the practice. And it's a great medical story. It's about medical education, and medical education is what advances the adoption of things like SDMA and our other proprietary expanded test menu.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. And just one last question in terms of international. So one of your competitors was acquired by a large company that has international expansion, so can you remind us a little bit about macro outside the U.S., the utilization behavior, how greenfield it is, whether or not somebody else in the market really has an impact in terms of the reach there and what you can do there in terms of the greenfield miss? I know that's not really a word, but just kind of remind us about the international dynamics, please.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, there are greenfield customers. We think outside of North America estimated to over 60,000 opportunities that \u2013 either the small number of remaining VetTest upgrades, competitive analyzers, which we're routinely swapping out by the way, and also the greenfield. Greenfield is probably about a third of that 60,000 and yet it's expanding because these markets are growing. People love their pets worldwide and medicine is advancing and we're a driver to advancing that. So we really do see a lot of growth opportunity globally, which is why we're embarking upon this 15% expansion in our field-based professionals between now and the end of the year when you look at our international field as a whole.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. And I will see you in two weeks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Great.","Operator","And with that speakers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Thank you all for the call. And, again, I want to thank all the IDEXXers who are working hard to achieve our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world. It's why we do what we do. And along the way, we're generating a nice return on it, but we just have so much work ahead of us. It's what propels us and we're pleased to be able to share those results with investors and look forward to seeing all of you in person or through the Reg FD Presentation at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.

I'm pleased to take you through our Q1 results in the strong momentum we're building in our business. In today's review of our Q1 2014, results I'll be referring to growth rates in the quarter, and let's otherwise noted these growth rates refer to Q1 2014, performance compared to Q1 2013 performance. ","In terms of key things you could take away from today's review, we continue to accelerate our revenue growth driven by global expansion of our CAG franchise. ","Organic revenue growth was 8% in Q1, at the high end of our expectations driven by 10.4% growth in global CAG Diagnostic Referring, normalized or changes in distributor inventory levels.","Our focus on innovation and clear benefits from our investments in our commercial capability globally is driving very strong instrument placements.","Worldwide Catalyst and Haematology placements increased 36% and 22% respectively year-on-year in Q1, and we sold over 1200 SNAP pros in the quarter, positioning us well for strong continued CAG annuity growth.","Our results reflect solid growth across regions as we continue to expand our international presence. Overall our international revenues increased 13% in Q1, including a 1% benefit from acquisitions. Growth was driven by 13% organic gains in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues and solid growth in our LPD business.","Finally we're delivering solid profit results reflected in our Q1 EPS growth of 10% to $0.89 per share. This performance is on track with our full year goals as we support investment towards our long term growth potential.","Based on our solid start to the year and the growth trends we've established in our recurring revenue streams, we\u2019re increasing our full year outlook for organic revenue growth for 2014, to 8% to 9%, versus our prior guidance of 7% to 8%. ","As a reminder this is effective and 8.5% to 9.5% organic growth rate when adjusted for estimated deferred revenue impact associated with the Catalyst 1 launch. I'll walk through that like in more detail later in the call.","Let me begin by breaking down our quarterly performance starting by an overview of growth by region. We continue to post strong growth across our major regions supported by strong momentum in our CAG business. As noted our international expansion continues on a strong track reflecting a 13% revenue growth in Q1 to $153 million, or 42% of overall revenues. This momentum was supported by strong growth in our CAG business across regions. We drove 14% organic growth in Europe CAG this quarter, supported by double digit gains in recurring diagnostic revenues across all three modalities. We drove strong reference lab growth in Germany and other key markets served by our Life Sick Facility as well as U.K. Favourable weather in these markets reinforced strong business execution.","We also benefited from extra momentum we're building in our organic business through our go-direct strategy. Our Asia CAG revenues grew 28% organically in Q1, reflecting strong growth across the region. Instrument placements were up significantly across Europe and Asia compared to a softer start in Q1 of 2013.","In the U.S we also posted solid gains in the quarter. Q1 revenues were $208 million, reflecting 6% organic growth. U.S. results were driven by CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains of 8%, normalized for distributor inventory changes. Note that Q1 revenues excluded $2 million of deferred revenues associated with the Catalyst 1 introductory offer.","This solid performance was achieved against the soft market backdrop impacted by unfavourable weather conditions. These effects can be seen in results of the over 4000 veterinary practises we track through our clinical level data.","For the first quarter in the U.S. patient visits were down 1.2% versus Q1 2013, and practise revenues were up 2.1%. this compares to the relatively steady growth of 2.1% in patient visits and 5.5% in practise revenue growth we saw for the full year in 2013. ","Our analysis of regional date shows that practise level growth was clearly impacted by unusually harsh winter weather in the East Coast, Mid West and South East. Based on this regional data we feel that Q1 practise, there's a decline is transitory and doesn\u2019t reflect longer term transfer growth and pet health care spending. We continue to plan for moderate overall market growth at the veterinary practise level for the balance of this year.","Our solid global revenue performance was driven by 9% organic growth in our Companion Animal Group. We're positioning ourselves for strong continued growth through excellent placement and instrument placements. Worldwide Catalyst Placements grew 36% year-over-year, with double digit growth in all major regions. While the high growth rate was held in part by a relatively easier comparison to the prior year Q1, we're up to a very strong start with the Catalyst 1 introductory offer placements in the U.S. and we continue to drive strong momentum across our chemistry platform in international.","We achieved the strong results while also maintaining a very high quality of placements on a global basis with over 50% going to customers new to IDEXX.","As expected the improved economics and footprint of the Catalyst 1 is broadening access to Catalyst Technology as evident by our strong penetration in Greenfield and competitive accounts as well as the accounts operating from Vet Tests. ","Given the substantial uplift we've seen in Diagnostic Testing after catalyst is placed, we believe this will support accelerated recurring IDEXX consumable growth.","Worldwide haematology placements also grew robustly in Q1. Overall placements were up 22% year-on-year, with strong growth across all regions. ","We continue to be pleased with our success in placing ProCyte Dx into accounts new to IDEXX and saw this metric increase to 50% in Q1, our best performance on record. Consistent with our expectations we are seeing some shift in haematology placements towards LaserCyte Dx, specially when we're sung a full instrument suite with callus 1. This is logical as the price point of LaserCyte Dx is an excellent match to callus-1, while still offering us a purer menu compared to any competitive haematology analyser.","Strong placements drove 16% organic growth in global instrument revenue in the quarter to nearly $19 million. Instrument revenues included benefits from the sale of over 1200 snap core units which Jon will speak to more in his comments.","As noted we estimated that the deferred revenue associated with our Catalyst 1intrudoctury offer was about $2 million in the quarter. ","As expected our instrument revenue growth is below our placement growth reflecting the relatively lower price point in Catalyst 1, as well as mix impacts associated with higher international sales of lower cost analysers. These effects have limited economic impact as margins are similar across our product line and instrument margin is a less significant driver of our financial performance.","The key driver of our financial performance CAG recurring diagnostic revenues for revenues associated with instrument consumables and service, rapid acid test kits and lab services were $259 million in the first quarter, representing about 72% of overall revenues. ","With highly durable annuity grew 10.4% organically year-on-year in Q1, normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. As noted these results were supported by strong gains across regions with overall growth straining at the high end of our full year goal of 9% to 11%. ","Changes in distributor inventories, the reported growth in recurring CAG diagnostic revenues by about 2% in the quarter. As U.S. distributor inventories finished at 3.4 weeks at the end of Q1, down from over 4 weeks at year end, a decline that didn't occur in Q1, 2013.","Prime Modality instrument consumable revenues of $84 million in Q1 grew organically 12% versus the prior year period or 15% or normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. Growth continues to be driven by a number of factors, including our steadily growing installed base that comes from customers due to IDEXX,, increased testing as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-house labs with Catalyst ProCyte enhance loyalty from our customer base.","Note that catalyst customers now account for nearly 90% of U.S chemistry consumable revenue exclusive of corporate accounts with the remaining 10% coming from Vet test customers. ","Revenues for our rapid asset kit component of the CAG recurring diagnostic revenue, which excludes SNAP Pro device revenue were $43 million in Q1. These revenues increased 3% normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, in part reflecting pressure from the U.S weather impact. ","We expect benefits from the strong launch of SNAP Pro will support solid continued growth in the rapid assay modality.","A reference lab consulting services modality grew 10% organically to $118 million in Q1. We saw strong growth in all of our regions around the world. In North America the diagnostic sales force model and utilization of VetConnect PLUS has helped to generate an increased in the level of diagnostics being run by our customers while also improving on our already strong customer attention rates. As noted our international regions also delivered strong volume growth added by well executed issues such as our new Life Sick IDEXX Direct Reference Lab, and our go-direct strategy in the Nordics.","Our Practice Management and Digital Imagining Systems business with revenues of $24 million in Q1 grew organically by 13%. We benefited from our base of pet health network Pro customers, largely than typical practice management installations and growth in the service components of both the practise management and digital imaging businesses tied to our loyal install base. Our Livestock Poultry and Dairy business also grew solid in Q1, up 5% originally. ","Overall revenues adjusted for foreign exchange grew 10% to 431 million, reflecting benefits from our acquisition of our Brazil distributor last fall. ","Solid organic growth was supported by continued expansion of our dairy business in China and progress in expanding our LPD business in Eastern Europe. Results were better than expected in the quarter due to a relatively slower than expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western Europe.","As noted in our last call changes in disease eradication programs get to add to volatility in this business. We expect these impacts will contribute to moderate organic revenue declines in our LPD for the balance of the year.","Our water business grew 4% in Q1, to $21 million, including benefits from the acquisition of our South Africa distributor. Organic growth was 2%, reflecting gains in our America's and Asia Pacific regions, offset by some tougher year-on-year comparisons in Europe in Q1.","Business growth continues to be driven by our Core Colilert Franchise as we build an increasing contribution from newer products. We took benefits from our new products will keep us on track for mid-single digit growth gaol this year.","Solid revenue gains across or business helped to drive continued strong profit in cash flow performance. While profit in Q1 increased 10% year-on-year supported by a 70 basis point year-over-year improvement in gross margin to 56%. Gross margin benefit from product cost efficiencies; moderate price gains and a reduction in royalty expense for one our products that also included a non-recurring benefit of about $1 million. This was offset a bit by some unfavourable product mix from higher proportion instrument sales.","Operating expenses were 37% of revenue in Q1, down slightly from last year as a percentage of revenue. As mentioned upfront, Q1 of 2013 included a $4 million charge to G&A related to the bankruptcy of the vendor. Adjusting for that operating expense as a percent of revenue increased 90 basis points. This increase is primarily driven by the investments we are making worldwide in sales and marketing that's helping to driver accelerated revenue growth.","Strong revenue growth supported margins that were in line with expectations. We need to deliver a fully diluted EPS of $0.89 per share. EPS growth was 10% and currency changes had no material impact. Our effective tax rate at 31.2% was as expected as does not include any benefit for the R&D tax credit for 2014 as it has expired and hasn\u2019t been renewed. As a reminder in regards to the R&D tax credit, Q1 of last year included both an adjustment for all of 2012 plus the normal credit for the 2013 quarter. Adjusting Q1 of 2013 to exclude the R&D tax credit recorded in the quarter and reserve associated with the vendor bankruptcy, EPS grew 12%. ","Free cash flow was $29 million or 62% of net income in Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was as expected reflecting the typical timing that we see in Q1 related to things like bonus payments and accounts receivable and inventory increases in advance of the heartworm [ph] ruined season.","We remain on track towards our full year outlook for free cash flow in the range of 95% to 100% of net income. Our strong cash flow enabled, continues to support our share repurchases in Q1. We repurchased 507600 shares for about $70 million during the quarter. ","Turning to our outlook given our strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year revenue guidance. We now expect full year 2014 revenues to be in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.51 billion. This reflects an expectation for full year organic growth in the range of 8% to 9%. The increase in our outlook reflects current trends towards the higher end of our full year goals of 9% to 11% growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues as well as upsides from stronger than expected LPD performance in Q1.","Our outlook intends to assume an excepted $5 million to $10 million of deferred revenue associated with a Catalyst 1 introductory offer. Adjusting for the impact of this revenue deferral, organic growth will be about 8.5% to 9.5% in 2014. ","We remain on track towards delivery of our full year goal of $3.76 to $3.86 EPS, or adjusted growth of 11% to 14%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margins for the full year compared to 2013. We intend to leverage upsides from our improved revenue outlook just for increased investment towards key long term growth initiatives which Jon will speak to in his comments.","For Q2 we'd highlight that we expect organic growth consistent with our full year outlook of 89%. We also expect operating margins will be about 100 basis points below year levels in Q2, reflecting increased commercial investments and impacts from targeted organizational changes in our European organization aligned with our growth strategy. ","With that I'll turn it over to Jon.","Jon Ayers","","Okay, thank you, Brian. As Brian elucidated we have strong performance in the quarter. In revenues, earnings and the key metrics such as instrument placements and the percent that go to accounts that are either competitive or new to IDEXX and thus expand our install base.","All these indicate, I think the health of the business I and the sustainability of our model for growing our markets. This growth and success were in virtually all regions of the world. The result of our Companion Animal Group in North America reflected the success of our sales transformation completed in Q3 of last year. This is the second full quarter of strong performance since having come through the learning period. ","Validating the new sales model, the key metrics are consistent with Q4 2013, for Veterinary Diagnostic Consults and 98% territory occupancy rate and a 60% increase in number of in-person customer visits over Q1 of 2013, the last quarter we were still fully in the old sales model. ","Customer acquisition for tension and utilization were also strong. Our new compensation plan implemented this Q1, that in part were work professionals for growing or recurring diagnostic revenue in their territory as well as instrument placements was also a great success. We believe we have now created a strong foundation for a North America CAG sales and marketing organization that we can readily scale as our revenues grow.","Internationally we also had strong performance in all of our major country markets. In many markets where we have a direct sales organization we're able to make investments that generate sustained revenue growth through instrument placements, new lab business and growth in veterinary practice usage of our diagnostics.","For illustration purposes let me give you some Q1 year-over-year organic growth of our CAG business in some selected country markets. We had over 30% organic growth in the Nordics, Austria, South Africa, Australia and China. We had over 20% in Japan and in Germany, Holland and Switzerland it 15% to 20% organic growth. In fact CAG International Organic growth was 15% overall. These growth numbers are a result of a strategy augmenting international and in-country leadership, supported by augmented structure and of course the global rule out of our innovative diagnostic offerings.","This growth also shows that pet owners everywhere have a strong bond with their pets and are willing consumers of veterinary healthcare when they understand the benefits of their beloved animals. Speaking advances in our diagnostic offering, our announcement this past January of our newest in-house chemistry platform, Catalyst 1 was a significant success as measured by the success of our introductory offer for this instrument, where customers buy Catalyst 1, and are known to Catalyst Dx until that unit is available. In this way customers immediately see the benefits of the pick up and testing the catalyst enables and of course add to our instrument consumable revenue growth.","The Catalyst 1 price point, it's practise is that run as few as one sample a day which is pretty low considering a single doc practice maybe seeing 13 to 15 patients a day, really should be more than one sample, but that's kind of where the industry is. So we're seeing the Catalyst 1 is the right instrument with the right footprint and the right price point for the vast majority of practices that don't already enjoy the benefit of catalyst technology with the Catalyst Dx and we continue to see strong growth and enhanced testing when customers upgrade the catalyst and a haematology offering for their in-house testing.","This both in utilization does not generally come at the expense of our reference lab testing, showing that testing begets testing. Our in-house instruments and their unique ability to allow customers generate results easily during the client visit, something we call real time care, expands the market for diagnostic testing. We are also very pleased with the launch of SNAP Pro mobile device in March. With sales of over 1200 units we're able to validate the instrument performs extremely well in the practice environment and provides tremendous value to our customers with rapid assay test kits like significantly improving work flow and staff efficiency. While at the same time automatically instantly adding their results to the patient's diagnostic history with Vetconnect PLUS.","We expect to build upon this installed base of customers throughout the year from our very large base of North American customers who regularly use our SNAP Rapid test kits. We expect that the value that SNAP Pro provides our customers are the SNAP family test kits will reinforce their loyalty to IDEXX at the in-house Test Kit modality and feed all of IDEXX Diagnostics.","Turning to our strategy of advancing diagnostic insight and value to information technology, we continue to redefine diagnostics through our club VetConnect PLUS, which changes the focus as the patient's results from what does one sample tell us to how does the most recent result fit into the patient's evolution and metrics over time, thus providing greater medical insight. We continue to grow the number of customer activation which now stands at over 13,300 and have launched the service in Australia in late March, adding to the U.S, Canada, and U.K launches previously.","An addition we continue to add functionality, including a mobile app version for I-phones and I-pads that notifies customers when new results are ready and shows these results. ","As I mentioned the customers who adopt that Connect PLUS increase their loyalty to IDEXX Diagnostics because of the unique value they can only receive when they use our ecosystem, including the results from our in-house labs, SNAP Pro and our reference lab services.","As a result of the combination of our new customer-centric sales model in North America and VetConnect PLUS option ,we can continue to see steadily increasing customer loyalty levels across our three diagnostic modalities , even as they today stand at what I would consider world class of 96% to almost 99% depending on the modality.","Our increase in organic revenue growth guidance today for 2014 of 8% to 9% that Brian mentioned reflects our confidence in the success we are seeing in our global markets and the sustained growth of the enduring recurring revenue of our three diagnostic modalities, reference labs, in-house instrument consumables, rapid assay test kits, supported now with launch of SNAP Pro. ","The advances of our diagnostic technology offering over the past few years which we have discussed regularly and in detail in this call provides for an offering that is quite unique and differentiate on key dimensions, importance of the veterinary and their staff. Notably our diagnostic ecosystem works in a seamless way to help veterinarians advance the standard of medical care and strengthen the bonds they have with pet owners. This accelerates the growth of their business and thus in turn our recurring revenue.","With this success we have decided to invest in incremental margin that comes from this revenue acceleration in 2014 in further resources that will both assure we achieve revenue in 2014 and propel IDEXX growth in years to come. Specifically we expect to increase the number of field sales, service, marketing and customer education resources in the North American market, scaling our now proven sales model. Scaling is far easier a task then the one we undertook last year to transform that sales model. Second, we expect to do the same key international markets where we believe we can augment demand for diagnostic offerings. Third, we'll be adding international regional and country leadership to support markets where we're are direct, including those markets where we've recently chosen to go direct. Fourth, we'll be adding international infrastructure to support long term growth in these markets. Note, as we are excited as we are today about the potential for growth in North America, we believe the growth opportunity internationally is even bigger. And finally we'll be augmenting our investment in cloud based IP solutions, including the continued global role out of VetConnect PLUS and the expansion of its capability along several dimensions.","So in conclusion, our goal over time is to build the momentum on our business to sustain double digit organic revenue growth. We very much believe this is achievable given the strong bonds between pets and owners globally and the medical value of the diagnostic category, not to mention the state of our innovative diagnostic and IT ecosystem. Yet we have to apply augmented commercial resources around the world to bring this to our customers and this goal to fruition.","We think this investment will provide an outstanding return and create significant incremental shareholder value. So with those comments Cynthia, I will turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) we will go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess Jon the first one for you on the sales force, given the transformation and the changing compensation. I'm curios if you can offer any color on, perhaps any surprises you've seen. Meaning are you seeing customer show proclivity to be more receptive to you know growth in one modality versus another or your seeing, cross on some opportunities to gain share using your in the point of care versus reference lab, just on anything there that's [indiscernible]","Jon Ayers","Sure, well of course you know we do believe we have a significant cost selling opportunity. I remind investors that if you look at our customers for in-house chemistry and our customers for the reference lab, there's only actually 40% overlap. So it's a very-very significant cost selling opportunity and we thought that was one of the key reasons for the transformation and a single point and contact with customers and of course we're able to better achieve that with a 60% growth in the number of visits. ","I would say you know the one thing that is continually reinforced to us is the value of real time care. As you know Ryan, our offering and it's ability to generate results in eight minutes easily, full comprehensive chemistry and a hematology profile, [indiscernible] will be added with Catalyst 1 and Catalyst Dx in coming quarters. That customers are now more and more realizing that they get greater compliance when they have the results in front of them and they're able to speak face to face in the moment, in context with the pet owner and greater compliance not only to you know whatever the treatment plan may be, but it's also greater compliance as any suggested follow-on testing which may go to reference lab. Which is why we say testing begets testing. So we believe and I think if you look at the kind of the general trend, we're seeing a growth in the in-house modality which is growing overall, a diagnostics modality that we are driving because of real time care and more and more customers are, you know I speak to customers at conferences, they readily say [ph] I just, you know really working for us. And our reps are very-very good at bringing that insight to customers, now that they are really representing the customer in all of our diagnostic modalities.","","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay very helpful and then it\u2019s my follow-up. Jon, I now you choose your words carefully and I think a minute ago you just mentioned inability to sustain double-digit organic growth. So, you think about your growth blueprint. I know you are not far from that in your guidance this year but as that a few years out it\u2019s kind of a three- to five-year goal. Is there any more color that are pretty important change in tone?some of the payers try to maybe ease up a little bit on some of the restrictions here and can just be a tailwinds. For U.S. we think about the balance in 2014 relative to 2013.","Jon Ayers","","Well. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re putting a time frame on that goal. Our organic growth goal this year is 8% to 9%. Obviously, we\u2019re higher organic growth in the Companion Animal business, which I believe is on the order of 85% of our revenues. Our overall organic growth for the company is brought down a little bit by the other 15% of the revenues that are generally just a little bit lower organic growth and of course we\u2019ve had the LPD, which has been actually had a good quarter but generally flat is slightly down as we worked through some of these eradication programs, but we are seeing the trajectory to acceleration and our goal is to accelerate at organic growth to the double digit level and at 8% to 9% we are not that far away from it. ","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","","Right. Okay, thanks guys. Nice talking to you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we go to line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","Hi guys. Thinking about the international expense you\u2019re kind of announcing right now, what change ","to you maybe 6 months ago, 12 months ago surrounding your expectations to bigger investment? Here I\u2019m wondering what happened this quarter that make you comfortable enough to make the switch?","Jon Ayers","","I think a number of things that came together. We have really good \u2013 we put in some excellent leadership with Michael Williams and we got really strong country management leadership. That combined with the fact that our modalities and our offerings are improving, as Brian mentioned the [indiscernible]extract with the [indiscernible]is really starting to penetrate the continental European market. Obviously, we have the prospects of Catalyst One. If we think Catalyst One is the excessive product in North America, our European guys said \u201cwell, we thought developed Catalyst One for us because it\u2019s so perfect\u201d and [indiscernible] for our markets. And of course that will be a 2015 opportunity as we rolled out that out. And then of course we\u2019re rolling out the diagnostic IT ecosystem with VetConnect PLUS. So, we just see the confluence of both and the markets are responding. I wouldn\u2019t say Europe is doing particularly well economy-wise although did have a weather quarter than the U.S. did. But look at the growth we\u2019re achieving but not only in Europe. Look at the growth we\u2019re achieving in Asia and we just of course went direct in Brazil with the acquisition of one of our distributors at Madasa. So, we just the opportunity there. We\u2019re seeing a [indiscernible]. We have the confidence, we have the leadership, we have the portfolio and so we take a time to accelerate that investment . Like I just said when you had good leadership it tends to identify more opportunities and the momentum build on itself and I think it\u2019s reinforcing whatever business we have globally and we\u2019re seeing more opportunity and we want to invest behind that because we think it\u2019s going to be aid to our accelerated growth trend and will be a great return for us.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates","","Right . And then maybe on the Noble Pro , the 1200 sign-ups that you had so far in the first quarter, but can you give a [indiscernible] 3:41 flavour in terms of other existing customers on SNAP [indiscernible] about the characteristics of the customers you had thus far.","Jon Ayers","","Yeah those are - though of course the target not be existing customers of SNAP because the vast majority of the North American Veterinary practices are customers of our SNAP. Line is fairly [indiscernible]. I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re seeing is they really appreciate, they basically load and walk away. I think SNAP, it\u2019s a very \u2013 that the workflow is just very, very beneficial for practices that are busy and they neither text every second. [indiscernible] like to think kind of benefit in workloads we brought with the in-house instruments on Catalyst and laser side and pro side on the hematology side, now the big improvement in workflow for the test kit modality in general. In fact, what we are seeing is the average practice. The average practice is buying two, not just one but two because they need them for all kind of volumes. So obviously that\u2019s a mix. Some practices are buying more and another practices are buying one. But we\u2019re just seeing really, really positive customer response. Obviously, we\u2019re very early but it\u2019s nice to see those. That\u2019s 1200 is [indiscernible] the feedback from the customers has just been universally very, very excited. ","Operator","","Thank you. And as a reminder if you have any questions or comments you may press * and then 1. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Alex [ph] with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First off, you\u2019ve mentioned weather a couple of times and also in U.S. it seems like seasonality. We\u2019re getting off to [indiscernible] and hard warm season. What sort of impact do you think that had on testing and I think you mentioned the patient visits were off 1.2% in Q1. Have you seen any sort of improvement since then?","Jon Ayers","","Yeah. Thank you for the question . Just give you a little context. That\u2019s a pretty big drop as we look at what patient visits will do quarter before or last five or six years, even during the great recession. 1.2% a decline \u2013 this is a fairly robust market. So, we don\u2019t see that. We only see it \u2013 I only like to see like one or two other quarters in the last five or six years and clearly it was regional as we\u2019re looking the regional thing. With 1000 practices you can get some fairly good granularity on originality of that. So, that just gives us some indication. I don\u2019t think in diagnostic testing that in general you may get lot, although those visits are lots. I don\u2019t know about other categories. I can only speak about our category. And so we expect there to be good demand. We think that decline is transitory. The 2% we saw in patient visits and the 5.5% in revenue growth with the clinical level for tech care services with our base of 4000 customers we saw on 2013 we think it\u2019s more the sustainable rate, but I don\u2019t think beyond that we\u2019ll make up any of the loss on the diagnostic category in the second quarter.","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And what the informatics you have, did you notice any kind of delay or drop in diagnostic testing especially in the South as I think hardware season got off to a late start?","Jon Ayers","Brian mentioned that rapid assay was a little bit a down again. We think that\u2019s kind of a weather transitory issue and a chunk of our rapid assay testing is parasitic disease which includes hardware testing and the purpose there is obviously you want to test before you put them on a preventative, kind of a co-indicator if you will. I guess it\u2019s the only thing I would say on that.","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Hardware [indiscernible] I would say that bigger impact as Jon highlighted was kind of a consistent weather impact in the year that you would expect see it just given the unusual conditions this winter. So, I think this was definitely more of a transitory planning and we would anticipate getting back to [indiscernible] that you saw last year. ","Jon Ayers","","Yeah . Good point. My people really came at the transitory impact on the patient visit day [indiscernible] that were reporting obviously were very, very pleased with our performance. And I\u2019m not going to put weather it\u2019s \u2013 I think it was very strong performance for the quarter when you [indiscernible] everything in and I\u2019m not thinking any weather component there.","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","My second question is one Catalyst One. On your prepared comments you mentioned that it\u2019s the right product because [indiscernible] don\u2019t use Catalyst now. Can you give us an idea of how big that [indiscernible] market is and what sort of penetration we should expect overtime?","Jon Ayers","","Well customers who don\u2019t use Catalyst today they use it by-product back to 50%. So, it\u2019s a ____ addressable market and that is it\u2019s the U.S. or North America number and that doesn\u2019t even include international. Obviously, we have very, very Catalyst Dx placement performance international. We don\u2019t have any introductory offer for Catalyst One international. We haven\u2019t really brought Catalyst One outside North America. So, that addressable market is even bigger, far bigger.","","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Okay.","Jon Ayers","","Generally speaking, practices are smaller outside North America than they are in North America. ","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Right.","Jon Ayers","","There are obviously [indiscernible] like country but they are not, you don\u2019t have these practices.","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I guess I [indiscernible] figure out I guess how quickly should we see that ramp in. It\u2019s obviously a gigantic market both in the U.S. and outside.","Jon Ayers","","Well, we had given an outlook for the 10% to 15% growth this year in Catalyst placements and hematology placements and we\u2019re obviously up to a solid start on that. So, this is something that will occur over time, but feel that\u2019s the pace of ramp that were projecting. We feel good about how we\u2019re executing on that opportunity.","Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Associating with the global initiative PR, where is the focus specifically internationally by geography and where will you be adding an international capacity on the lab side of the business like a new lab similar to what you\u2019ve done in Germany? Did that support that sort of global demand or how you\u2019ll be entering entirely new market here?","Jon Ayers","","Yeah. Thank you, Erin for that question. You know what the neat thing is that we really already have a base in almost every market. I would say the market that we really didn\u2019t feel like we had a strong base in was Brazil and now with the acquisition of a wonderful, wonderful distribution organization in which IDEXX aligned very consistent with our culture of entrepreneuralism. We have a strong base in Brazil. Obviously, we\u2019ve been in Europe since early 1990s, we had been in China, for example since 2002. So, it\u2019s really broad based. It\u2019s there really isn\u2019t any market where people have pets. They generally if they have pets, they value their pets and they value more and more. So, whether it\u2019s Europe including Eastern Europe or for example South Africa, we have now gone direct in South Africa and Asia. We are doing very well. I think I may have mentioned in the call, Japan is a very strong market for us, the combination of Catalyst and ProCyte is. Japan is an in-house market that large majority of the testing is done in-house. They like to run in house. We got a very, very competitive portfolio there and our Japan organization really kicked in and gearing starting in Q4 and continued in Q1, and so it\u2019s really across the board. And with regard to labs, we continue to look carefully about how to build out an optimise the lab infrastructure to provide world class service levels. In just little context here in the U.S. the majority of the market will kind of take place today service level for granted, but that\u2019s an innovation outside the U.S. and that\u2019s [indiscernible] picked up results in the evening and provided results the next morning. It wasn\u2019t something that was really being done in continental Europe until we launched the [indiscernible] With its great logistic type of work and it was totally innovative thing. And so we think that combination of the [indiscernible]and our core lab in Lubisberg, Germany really makes a very powerful platform for continental European growth and of course we have strong lab organization in the U.K.","","Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And fondly speaking, how would you characterize the profitability of the overseas business relative to the North American business in Companion Animal?","Brian McKeon","","It\u2019s a same fundamental economics in terms of the contribution that we get from recurring CAG diagnostics across modalities. I think it is we\u2019re in a relatively earlier stage in investment and the infrastructure given the size of some of the businesses that we built to date. So the U.S. is obviously further along main. So, I think it\u2019s relatively lower, but it\u2019s not driven by fundamentally different economic drivers. It\u2019s more our choice in growth markets to be investing maybe any infrastructure to build the business for the long term and as Jon said I think we see opportunities to do that investment [indiscernible] broadly and over time expect it will yield similar type of returns that what we see in the U.S.","Jon Ayers","","Yeah. And I would say I will take the instrument and consumable business. The economics are very attractive around the world taking very little bit by country but overall they are very, very attractive and [indiscernible] we have a mature organization like we have in North America are very, very attractive. Obviously, the places will adjust getting more invested in new lab or starting up the lab organization just as what we, and start a lab anywhere there is an investment period. But I would reinforce what Brian is saying the core economics are quite equally attractive around the world.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks you so much.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","","HI. I\u2019m actually Ethan Robb [ph]. I\u2019m for Jon Block. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a first follow-up on Catalyst One I note so early in the lunch. But I was wondering if you could give any commentary on Catalyst One\u2019s contribution to the 36% growth in Catalyst placements and then also are you seeing these Catalyst One placement, why not it\u2019s something placed yet, but are you seeing the customer ordering Catalyst One more new accounts or is it upgrades from that at best? Thanks.","Jon Ayers","Yeah. I would say a large majority of what we saw in North America were Catalyst One and obviously Catalyst One has had pre offer and we were placing Catalyst Dx and we have deferred revenue component that Brian mentioned of up $2 million. Our percent placement to what I want to call \u201caccounts that [grow on sold days] [ph]\u201d that would be competitive at these placements or Greenfield accounts or just generally accounts that are new to IDEXX. Brian mentioned that greater than 50% Metric. In North America it was even higher than that, it\u2019s anywhere at 50% or 59%. So, that\u2019s a very attractive \u2013 that\u2019s actually a high point for us in terms of competitive placements. And again one of the metrics that I mentioned I think really speaks the core health of the business and the opportunity for growth that we have. Obviously, we still have VetTest. We don\u2019t have as many VetTest as we used to have little bit more than 10% of our consumables excluding corporate accounts and these are coming from VetTest accounts. But one of the things that we see when we upgraded the VetTest is they grow. They grow their in-house testing by 45% and we don\u2019t fully realise that 45% because we\u2019ve given some rebates to expand the profile with haematology and electrolytes. So, we only achieved 25%, so pretty good. But they\u2019re saying that big uptake in growth and that helps their practice. This is a growth agenda and they see that uptake whether they are upgrading from that test or they are upgrading form a competitive analyser because of the unique nature that are in house lab. That\u2019s the ability to turn results around easily and quickly 8 minutes within the 20-30-minute exam so they see that nice uptake. So, we really are by placing our analysers were expanding the market and so we get growth on both pipes of placements. Obviously when it\u2019s a customer needed IDEXX we get a 100% of that is added to our consumable growth.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up question on the referring flat and you put up a really strong number even with some challenging weather conditions. Could you share us any details on how the business in North America performed relative to international?","Jon Ayers","","We had a strong dimension stronger across regions. Europe, interestingly we had questions on the weather dynamic. It actually had good weather in Europe, I think, that helped a bit, but it was relatively stronger growth international but quite solid growth in the U.S. as well and the bulk of that growth was driven by volume gains. So, we feel very good about the health of the business across regions and particularly with some of the headwinds we saw in the U.S.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay. So, one last housekeeping [ph] question here. On a full-year EPS guidance, how you\u2019re thinking about the FpEx impact. It seems as if you\u2019re expecting having six centric [ph] the last time you reported. Now is it just a three centric from FpEx?","Jon Ayers","","We changed the methodology there. I\u2019m glad you point that out. We in the past had adjusted how we normalize for FpEx as we had adjusted the current year to prior year rates. We got a new methodology that it kind of leaves our current year numbers as is an adjust to prior years to see all the change in the table. There really isn\u2019t much of a change in terms of the impact of FpEx. If you look at the normalized EPS growth, it\u2019s very similar 11 and 14 or it\u2019s the same. And that\u2019s really just the change you see in a success and three centric [ph] is just related to that, that methodology change is not. There was some slight improvement in that impacts but it wasn\u2019t a material impact.","Operator","","Thank you. And as a reminder if you do have any questions or comments press * and then 1. We\u2019ll go to the line of Ross Taylor with CL King. Your line is open.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates","I had a question related to your comment about you potentially getting to double digit organic growth and you\u2019re able to accelerate to that page. How much would that be dependent on increasing your installed base of customer versus just higher utilization of your existing customer base.","Jon Ayers","I don\u2019t know we are both advancer [ph] and third is greater retention and those were kind of some modest price realization as Brian said it\u2019s not a big factor, it\u2019s a small factor but it\u2019s mostly volume both in our in-house, it\u2019s as price of bulk of our growth that we\u2019re exhibiting in first quarter is volume. We think volume is very healthy. We think when we see revenue growth is driven by volume growth and testing is a very healthy dynamic. But it\u2019s going to some about we really see \u2013 if we look as I mentioned are our new comp plan [ph] which rolled on Q1 great success with the North American Veterinary diagnostic consultants. We\u2019ve advising [ph] them to grow a recurring diagnostic revenue and they get what their lost ways to grow it and they were quite successful in doing it and I think there is just a lot there in that opportunity that we see is on tape and it\u2019s going to be utilization, it\u2019s going to be new customer acquisitions with customer retention.","Brian McKeon","","I would highlight the key \u2013 we talked about overall growth but obviously the key drive for our business is this recurring CAG diagnostic annuity, which grew 10% in the quarter and that now looks 9% to 11% for the year and what percentage of our total revenue that is 7% of our total revenues? This is a 72% in Q1 and that\u2019s from what we\u2019re trying to drive as a business model at the end of the day that\u2019s what going to drive cash flow on our success economically and we\u2019re feeling very good ---","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates","Just one final question and maybe I missed this in some of your prepared remarks but I guess revenues were a little better than you expected in the first quarter and can you give any comment as to whether in other words certain regions or product areas that really outperformed versus your expectations or whether it was more just across the board? ","Brian McKeon","I would say two themes to highlight one is just strong execution, very pleased with how the company executed in Q1, a great start to the year. LPD was better than we expected in Q1, we expected a slow ramp down in some of the bovine testing programs in Europe and that\u2019s \u2013 we do expect that to happen and we expect to pressure the balance year on that, but it was delayed a bit in Q1 and I would highlight that as a factor on the margin. ","Jon Ayers","And the only one on the other margin is, as Brian mentioned briefly we had \u2013 while we had unfavourable weather in the US, we had favourable revenue in Europe and that probably added a little bit to the European performance although that execution fundamentally was very very strong, underlying that \u2013 when you put the two together but it was \u2013 and by the way I don\u2019t think about favourable weather \u2013 it\u2019s not a big as the US. So but probably we are going down the fine points here to answer your question.","Operator","We will go to the line of Jeff Frelick from Canaccord Genuity.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning, this is Mark in for Jeff. Wanted to just maybe ask Jon if you can maybe add some color on increase in the field sales organization outside of North America? Can you walk us through or would you be able to quantify number of direct reps you are targeting for 2014 whether it is by region or even by continent? ","Jon Ayers","Yes, no, I'm not really in the position to do that. It is really very, very country specific and there are a lot of different countries and the \u2013 one interesting thing about that companion animal business is each country is a little different. The core economics are the same, the opportunities the same but the way we execute in each country's a bit different. Part of it is because the way veterinary medicine is taught, it is different by country. So we really take a country specific approach. I think that's one of the strengths of our international organization is we have strong country management, strong entrepreneurial country management, they understand and take advantage of the market opportunity in front of them. They are able to adapt these core strategies to the market in general, as we've mentioned we've gone direct in the Nordics. We've gone direct in South Africa. We've gone direct in Brazil with an acquisition. And other markets we use, some markets we've been direct for 20 years and other markets we have very strong distribution that works well for us, so it is very specific. So it is hard to give numbers there. ","Unidentified Analyst","And just as a follow-up, obviously weather was an impact in Q1. Could you maybe discuss what your expectations are for vet growth both at practice volume and practice revenue bucket?","Jon Ayers","I would say for the balance of the year we really expect the same that we saw for the full year of 2013, which was 2% roughly practice visit growth and 5 to 5.5% I think in terms of practice of revenue for the balance of the year. That\u2019s the US number, obviously outside the US we don\u2019t have the same kind of metrics but generally they are very good growth markets.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. So with that, we will finish here with closing comments.","Jon Ayers","I want to thank everybody for joining the call. I also really want to thank all the employees of IDEXX around the world for just a great quarter. I think we are doing great things to bring support and technology to our customers and the companion animal business, we are helping strengthen the bonds that matter, including the pet human bond and the bond between pet owners and the practice. We are bringing great things to the world in terms of our water and life style poultry diary business, and just really phenomenal success, so I really want to thank all \u2013 to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees and we look forward to continuing to update investors with our progress throughout the year in our future calls.

McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning and thanks everybody for joining us today in our call. I'll be taking you through our Q3 results and our outlook for the full year, and I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2017. Jon will follow with his comments.","We delivered 10% organic revenue growth in third quarter, driven by 12% organic growth in CAG recurring revenues and continued strong premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue, which contributed about 2% to overall revenue growth. EPS was $0.62 per share, up 29% as reported and 22% on an adjusted constant currency basis, with prior year third quarter results adjusted to exclude impacts from a $0.06 per share software impairment charge.","Our business performance continues to track very well. Today we're updating our 2016 guidance to reflect projected performance at the high-end of our previous revenue growth and EPS ranges. We're now projecting full-year organic revenue growth of 10.5% to 11.5% and EPS of $2.35 to $2.39, or 15% to 17% reported EPS growth. Our full-year EPS outlook reflects 21% to 23% adjusted constant currency growth, supported by solid constant currency operating margin improvement. We're also raising our free cash flow outlook to about 105% of net income for the full year, reflecting strong progress in reducing inventory levels and a relatively lower outlook for capital spending.","As has been our practice, we are sharing our preliminary P&L guidance for 2017 today, which reflects targeted revenue of $1.910 billion to $1.935 billion, and EPS of $2.77 to $2.93 per share. This outlook reflects expectations for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth overall, supported by strong organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues.","Our 2017 EPS outlook includes $0.08 to $0.12 per share of projected P&L benefit from implementing new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. Adjusting for this impact and currency changes, which will provide a $0.03 per share EPS headwind at assumed rates, our 2017 EPS outlook equates to 15% to 20% constant currency growth consistent with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2016 and preliminary 2017 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q3 performance by segment and region.","Organic growth in Q3 continue to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $385 million, up 12% organically, reflecting strong CAG recurring diagnostic revenue gains across U.S. and international regions, and continued high global growth in instrument sales. Water revenues increased 9% organically to $28 million, driven by double-digit gains in international markets. These gains offset relatively softer performance in our LPD business, as strong growth in China and Brazil were offset by lower levels of testing related to European bovine disease eradication programs and reduced health herd screening in Asia. Overall, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 2% organically in Q3 to $30 million.","By region, U.S. revenues were $277 million in the quarter, up 10%, supported by strong growth in premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 9% organically, net of about 1% of growth headwind related to pure equivalent days in the quarter.","Strong U.S. CAG recurring performance was supported by continued double-digit revenue growth in our U.S. lab business and accelerating consumable gains. Recurring CAG revenue growth continues to be primarily volume-driven, aided by solid net price gains. Average net price gains for U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues overall are tracking in the 2% to 3% range, supported by our significant product differentiation and enhanced commercial capability, which is resulting in relatively lower levels of discounting.","Our U.S. performance continues to outpace solid U.S. market growth, as reflected in our dataset from about 5,200 clinics. In Q3, patient visits per practice increased 2.3% and revenues per practice increased 5.8% overall, with relatively stronger performance in August and September. International revenues in the second quarter were $171 million, up 11% organically, driven by 17% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. The expansion of Catalyst platform globally drove international consumable revenue gains above 20% in Q3. In addition, similar to our experience in the U.S., we're seeing incremental benefits from SDMA that is supporting continued double-digit gains in lab revenues.","Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $32 million, up 22% organically, supported by 18% growth in premium instrument placements. Globally, we placed 1,214 Catalysts, 814 premium hematology analyzers, and 562 SediVues in the third quarter.","In North America, we've placed 490 Catalysts with 292 or 60% at competitive or greenfield accounts. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase in competitive placements, supporting a 13% year-on-year increase in our U.S. Catalyst instrument base. Please note that in the third quarter of 2015, we benefited from placements of over 200 second Catalysts at U.S. customers, about 100 units more second Catalysts that we placed in Q3 of this year. While comparisons to higher levels of second Catalyst placements last year constrained overall Catalyst placement growth in Q3, this initiative has been very helpful in supporting continued improvement in U.S. consumable revenue retention rates, which are now tracking at 98% annualized.","International instrument placement performance continues to be very strong as well, reflected in 1,211 premium instrument placements and 269 placements of VetTests. International premium instrument placements were up modestly versus very strong prior year levels, as we begin to lap the international Catalyst One launch expansion.","Strong instrument placement trends continue to support high growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were $324 million in Q3, up 12% organically. By modality, instrument revenues of $114 million grew 15% organically, supported by higher growth in both U.S. and international markets. Reference laboratory and consulting services revenues were $147 million in Q3, up 13% organically.","U.S. lab revenue gains continued at a strong pace, with 12% volume-driven organic gains supported by benefits from SDMA, which continues to drive strong growth in core chemistry panels. International lab revenues also posted strong 13% organic growth, with solid performance across markets.","Rapid assay revenues increased 2% organically in Q3 to $49 million. As expected, we saw some moderation in rapid assay growth related to the timing of prior year promotional programs, with overall growth supported by solid gains in 4Dx revenues. Veterinary software, services and digital imaging system revenues were $29 million in the quarter, up 7% organically, reflecting solid growth at software, service and digital recurring revenues.","Turning to the P&L, strong revenue growth and a flow-through drove excellent profit results in the quarter. Please note that our Q3 2015 financial results included an $8 million software impairment charge. For purposes of the following commentary, we've excluded those impacts when we refer to adjusted comparisons for key metrics.","Operating profit was $88 million, up 10% compared to adjusted prior year levels, supported primarily by gains in our CAG segment. Reported operating profit gains were mitigated by the lapping of $5 million in prior year foreign exchange hedge gains. On a constant currency basis, operating margins of 19.7% were up about 100 basis points, reflecting benefits from gross margin gains and operating expense leverage.","Gross profit was $247 million in Q3, up 10% on a reported basis. Constant currency gross margin gains of 70 basis points reflected benefits from moderate price increases, favorable mix impacts from strong consumable growth, global volume leverage in reference labs, and continued improvements in our software services business. Mix impacts from higher instrument revenues partially moderated these gains.","For 2016, we had a $600,000 foreign exchange hedge gain in Q3 reported in gross profit, which partially offset impacts from the lapping of the $5 million 2015 hedge gain. Operating expenses increased 10% in Q3, slightly below revenue growth levels and relatively favorable to our prior Q3 outlook, reflecting timing of investments.","As noted, EPS was $0.62 per share, up 29% on a reported basis and 22% adjusting for currency impacts and the 2015 software impairment charge. The federal R&D tax credit, which benefited 2016, but not 2015 third quarter results, had a favorable 2% EPS growth impact. EPS growth continues to benefit from share repurchases, albeit at a moderated pace, which reduced year-on-year share count by 1.9%. In Q3, we repurchased 142,000 shares for $15 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 1.1 million shares at an average price of $79 per share. Given increases in our share price, which raises dilutive EPS impacts and moderation in share repurchases in Q2 and Q3, we expect year-on-year share count will be reduced by about 1% in Q4 and 2.5% to 3% for the full year 2016.","As noted, our free cash flow is trending very well and is now projected to be about 105% of net income in 2016. This performance is supported by lower inventory levels, improved receivable metrics, and an outlook for relatively lower levels of capital spending. Our current outlook for capital spending is $80 million for 2016, or about 4.5% of revenues.","Strong cash flows have supported a moderate reduction in our leverage levels. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.1 billion in debt outstanding, with an average interest rate of about 2.5%, reflecting a gross leverage ratio of 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA within our targeted 2.5 to 3 times leverage range. Cash investment balances were $391 million at quarter-end.","Looking ahead, we're adjusting our full year 2016 guidance to reflect solid Q3 performance and continued strong operating trends. We're adjusting our 2016 revenue guidance range to $1.763 billion to $1.773 billion. We've updated our foreign exchange rate estimates used for guidance purposes, which resulted in a $2 million reduction in our 2016 reported revenue outlook, primarily related to erosion in the British pound. This effect partially offset an increase of $10 million to the low end of our previous revenue guidance range, reflecting solid operating trends. Our updated outlook yields of reported full year revenue growth outlook of approximately 10% to 11% and organic revenue growth of 10.5% to 11.5%. We're adjusting our 2016 EPS guidance to $2.35 to $2.39, which reflects expectations for constant currency margin gains of 21% to 23% adjusting for the 2015 software impairment.","We're on track to post operating margins slightly ahead of our prior 19% full year estimate, which will result in 100 basis points or more of year-on-year constant currency improvement compared to 2015 results adjusted for the software impairment charge. As noted, we've updated our outlook for FX impacts with assumptions detailed in our press release. At the updated exchange rates, we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will reduce year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by about 1% and 2016 EPS by $0.20 per share, including net impacts from the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains compared to projected hedge gains of about $4 million in 2016. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate at 30.5% to 31% for the year.","As we finish 2016, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong revenue and profit growth in 2017, consistent with our long-term goals. Our preliminary outlook is for 2017 revenue of $1.910 billion to $1.935 million [sic] billion (16:06), reflecting 9% to 10.5% organic growth. This outlook reflects expectations for continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues, which will offset some moderating impacts as we lap very strong gains in instrument placements, and plan for relatively modest growth in LPD revenues, given current business trends.","Our reported revenue outlook incorporates a 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange at the rates noted in our press release. This will reduce 2017 operating profits by about $4 million and EPS by about $0.03 per share, and create a slight headwind to reported operating margins.","Our 2017 EPS outlook of $2.77 to $2.93 includes $0.08 to $0.12 per share of projected benefit from the implementation of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. Under the new guidance, tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, which have been reflected in cash flows, will be treated now \u2013 in the future as a reduction in reported income taxes in the P&L rather than as an equity adjustment. In addition, we will no longer assume that the tax benefit is used to repurchase shares in our diluted EPS calculation.","Based on stock repurchase activity over the last two years, we estimate this will be \u2013 this will reduce IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate by \u2013 based on share-based compensation activity over the last two years, we estimate this will reduce IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate by 250 to 350 basis points, and lower our projected year-on-year reduction in shares outstanding from repurchases by about 50 basis points. Incorporating this new accounting guidance, our preliminary outlook for our 2017 effective tax rate is 27% to 28.5%, and for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, net of the 0.5% accounting impact noted.","We're projecting continued annual share repurchases at a relatively consistent gross leverage level of 2.5 times EBITDA. Our outlook for share count reductions from stock repurchases next year is relatively lower than our long-term goals, primarily reflecting carryover impacts from moderate repurchase activities in 2016.","Adjusting for benefits from the new accounting guidance and foreign exchange impacts, our EPS outlook equates to 15% to 20% constant currency growth. This is consistent with our long-term goals and reflects a targeted 70 basis point year-on-year improvement in operating margins, net of modest headwinds associated with year-on-year FX changes. We look forward to providing an updated and more detailed review of our 2017 guidance in our year-end conference call.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, very, very comprehensive. Our strategy of bringing new innovations to our global markets through an enhanced commercial capability is solidly on track. Our strategy's continuing success along with solid continued market growth led to our achieving the 10% organic revenue growth for the company. As a whole, and as Brian pointed out, the 12% organic growth of our global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, which year-to-date comprise about 73% of our total revenues and have some of the most enduring profit characteristics. We are pleased as well that we are ahead of schedule in our progress this quarter on operating margin enhancement, as demonstrated by the 100 basis points of constant currency operating gains in Q3.","Our commercial capabilities in the U.S. continued to gain momentum and we continue to make selective investments in our field-based U.S. sales and support organization, with about 40 professionals added in the last six months, bringing the total to about 375 professionals. We are expanding the field staffing even as we achieve operating expense leverage, the benefit of even stronger organic revenue growth and productivity and other parts of the P&L.","We also achieved outstanding results internationally including, but not limited to, the important markets of Europe, where we saw a strong double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, driven by the commercial investments we've made over the past few years. A couple of key performance metrics illustrate the success that I'd like to highlight.","Let's talk about our North American premium instrument installed base, which continues to grow solidly as a result of several factors. First, we have achieved increasingly strong retention rates of our chemistry instrument customer base in the U.S., where we can now report that Q2 annualized retention was about 98% as measured by revenue, and our Q3 initial data indicates annualized retention is continuing at this 98% level. This is within 0.5% of the levels that we were achieving just before we announced we were going fully direct in mid-2014.","Secondly, in Q3 we placed over 1,400 premium instruments in North America, an all-time quarterly high. As part of that, we continue to grow competitive and greenfield placements of Catalyst chemistry units in North America, up 9% year-over-year, as Brian mentioned.","Finally, SediVue analyzer orders and placements continued to be strong. SediVue analyzer Q3 revenues benefited both from the Q3 orders and placements against the backlog going into the quarter from the launch earlier in the year. And SediVue placements contribute to growth in recurring revenue. Our current estimates indicate that a SediVue placement generates between $3,000 and $4,500 in annual recurring revenue.","Continuing with the metrics, we reported exceptional global VetLab recurring revenue growth of 15% in Q3. U.S. continued to accelerate in Q3 over Q2. While we laid plan for SediVue's launch internationally, with placements beginning in UK and Australia in Q4, our teams around the world continues to make exceptional progress growing chemistry and hematology instrument installed base, upgrading VetTest customers to Catalyst, and driving the recurring revenue of instrument consumables. The exceptional international instrument consumable growth of greater than 20% is a consequence of strong placements over the past year of Catalyst One, combined with deep experienced talent in our country organizations around the world.","Globally, our reference labs and consulting services reported a strong quarter of 13% organic growth, while improving our lab gross margins in the process, a contributor to the company's overall gross margin gains. In our Q2 call with investors, we'll recall how we said that our new kidney function test, IDEXX SDMA was growing our U.S. reference lab revenues through accelerated growth of requisitions that include chemistry panels. Now, with the experience of another quarter, we can see the same impact in each of our international lab markets tied with the launch of IDEXX SDMA as part of the routine chemistry panel in each market. This validates that IDEXX SDMA is supporting overall lab revenue growth by offering a unique new value to the chemistry profile.","Let me provide a quick update on our new product pipeline. We are on track to introduce our PROREAD software update for SNAP Pro in Q4 this year. PROREAD will allow the device to automatically interpret results for all SNAP tests. We see increased loyalty to our rapid assay lines when customers adopt SNAP Pro into their workflow.","Second, we are also on track to introduce the IDEXX SDMA test for Catalyst, for Catalyst on a Catalyst slide for in-house use in Q4 of 2017. Excitement about SDMA at the point-of-care is running high. Finally, we're on track to launch a new SNAP using antigen technology to perform in-house fecal test, currently planned for the first half of 2018. This standard preventative care test is run routinely in the practice today using microscopy, and the SNAP will be able to replace these time-consuming manual in-house methods.","In addition to these previously announced innovations, we are excited to announce another menu expansion for our Catalyst platform, this time for C-reactive protein, or CRP, an inflammatory marker. We plan to launch the CRP slide in Q1 of 2017, with a focus on certain international markets. This new CRP slide highlights yet another proof point of the power of Catalyst as the platform that continues to grow in value, in part through continued market expansion, such as we've had with the additions of phenobarbital, fructosamine, the total T4 slide, and the upcoming SDMA slide.","In summary, our company is executing at a high level, in line with our growth strategy, in a market with enduring growth characteristics. The momentum in the business gives us confidence in the 2017 financial guidance, as provided by Brian.","And with that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you speak to the competitive dynamics across the reference laboratory business? At this point, what sort of share gains do you think are attributable to SDMA? And could you break out maybe the growth rates across the U.S. reference laboratory business and international and how we should think about, I guess, that SDMA dynamic once it's offered in clinic? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. Let me just take the last part of that question first. We're very excited \u2013 there is a lot of excitement with our customers that we will be offering SDMA on a slide for our Catalyst platform in about a year's time. Many customers run their full chemistry panels in-house and are waiting for the opportunity to add SDMA to that panel. And so, we actually believe, as in many cases where testing begets more testing, that by offering it in-house, we're going to actually expand the awareness and the understanding of the clinic utility of SDMA. And, of course, there are many markets around the world where we don't have a ready reference lab option. And so, this will, of course, be value to our over 20,000 Catalyst customers on a global basis.","The competitive environment in the U.S. is always intense. It remains intense. We operate in an environment with a very, very capable competitor. We're pleased with our double-digit U.S. gains in the reference lab. Some of that's coming from expanded utilization of our expanse of menu of tests with our existing customers. Some of it's coming from volume gains that are beyond that, and of course, we're getting some price realization.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Erin, we mentioned that the U.S. organic growth in labs was 12% and the international growth was 13%.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And a follow-up on fundamental demand trends. You mentioned strength in August and September being, I guess, a little bit stronger. What about quarter-to-date? And do you have, I guess, any view on the sustainability of the trends here? What is reflected in your 2017 guidance as it relates to fundamental demand? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. We really see it is a steady market. I mean, we saw a nice 5.8% growth in clinic \u2013 in practice revenue that's measured by 5,200 data points, so it's a pretty good number of observations there. I think that was a pretty good number for Q3. And so, I think it's steady as she goes. We really don't \u2013 your guess is as good as ours with regard to the general economy. But I think as we look at all the trends, we see a continuation of the fundamentals we've seen in this market for the past year or two, and that's what's embedded in our outlook for 2017.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Erin, I think, year-to-date the \u2013 that same metric Jon referenced is up 6.6%. We saw market growth north of 6% in August and September. It was a little bit softer in July, but I think to Jon's point, we're seeing \u2013 we've seen continued solid trends, and that's what we're assuming next year.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","About a third of our Companion Animal Group revenues, of course, come from outside the U.S. And when we saw nice, strong double-digit recurring revenue growth in Europe \u2013 I think a market most people would say isn't the most exciting in the world \u2013 not that strong or different than the U.S. market, but it really shows that I think we can grow this market through innovation. People are willing to spend money on their pets. That is an enduring trend. And it can happen in markets around the world, and Europe being the prime example.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And to your question on SDMA, as Jon noted, we saw a similar uplift in international markets to chemistry panel growth. Now that we've got the SDMA marker, we're kind of building traction and understanding within the market. So that we're seeing the same kind of supportive benefits to our lab growth. And as a reminder, we had projected over longer term, we think, that SDMA can add about 2% to our lab growth rate.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and the details thus far. I wanted to ask a few follow-ups on SediVue. Jon, you mentioned in your prepared comments, I believe you're seeing consumable streams annually run at $3,000 to $4,500. I'm curious if you can remind us how that is trending, one, versus expectations, and number two, if there's any confounding factors there like the early adopters perhaps driving better growth of being bigger clinics.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. First of all, the market response to SediVue has been really quite impressive, combined with, I think, an extraordinarily capable commercial organization in North America. And I think we're hitting a \u2013 we're addressing a pain point of manual urinalysis or the issues associated with sending out samples and seeing the decay in the clinical value of urine as it passes over time and analyzed at the reference lab. So we're very pleased with the placements.","What we're doing is we're giving you early indicators of what we believe to be the consumable growth per placement, and we are very excited about the long-term outlook for SediVue, given that we're selling SediVue into practices large, medium and small. And so, the $3,000 to $4,500 is within the range that we provided before we'd launched SediVue and didn't have any field experience. And we wanted just to provide a little bit more refinement on that now that we've got four, five months of \u2013 really actually only four to five months of experience in the field.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then I guess a follow-up on that. Is SediVue opening up IDEXX to new accounts? Or maybe asked differently, are SediVue installs yet going to new customers, given the novelty of that product and some of the workflow benefits, or have you focused more with the sales on just meeting demand from your existing customers, and then the share gains could be in quarters to come?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. I believe that SediVue was one of many contributors to the 9% growth in competitive Catalyst placements. But, of course, we have large number of IDEXX customers that want to adopt the newest technology, and so we want to serve them too. So, a portion, less than 50% \u2013 well, less than 50%, a portion of those SediVues are going to accounts that do not have our other in-house equipment, and sometimes they add. The other in-house equipment is part of the placements. Sometimes that equipment comes later, because, of course, once we place the SediVue into an account which doesn't have in-house equipment, they get the IDEXX VetLab Station -- comes with it, and they begin to see and appreciate that highly differentiated value of our integrated offering and things like VetConnect PLUS. It really opens the conversation to differentiators.","So, clearly, SediVue along with innovations such as SDMA is giving us access to accounts that want to learn about this technology, an access that we didn't previously have when we were talking about our more traditional in-house chemistry and hematology.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just on the tax adjustment, so my understanding is \u2013 and this is going to be something that's going to be recurring going forward, so we should think about the lower tax rate in 2018 and beyond?","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yes, that's right. This is \u2013 to make it a little simpler to understand, in our cash flow statement you'll see the tax benefits that flow from when employees exercise their stock-based compensation. And going forward, this change has no impact on cash flow, but now \u2013 it used to flow through equity, now it will flow through the P&L. There's a little bit of an offset, where in our diluted EPS calculation you would assume that cash flow will be used to repurchase shares, and that will no longer be the case going forward. So, that $0.01 per share benefit that we gave is the net of those two numbers.","I would highlight this is going to \u2013 it's not easy to predict. It's going to vary quarter by quarter. We're putting out a reasonable estimate based on the activity by quarter we've seen the last couple of years. We'll, obviously, talk and be transparent about that each quarter, but it is something that's going to be a little more volatile in terms of the metric.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Derik, just to highlight it. I think Brian is \u2013 every company is going to have this...","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","...a change in the accounting for taxes associated with the options, new guidance. We just want \u2013 given that we provide 2017 guidance at this point, we wanted to be very transparent as to what is the impact of this versus the fundamentals of the company. It's just consistent with the way we like to do business.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, thanks. Appreciate the color on that. And if I can do one quick follow-up. When you sort of look at your international, and particularly in the UK, are you embedding anything in terms of potential slowdown because of currency movements in the UK or just general consumer weakness in UK? And just sort of how do you think about the UK in 2017?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Our UK business is on fire. I can't believe how strong. We have an unbelievable team there, and we are not seeing anything. I mean, the only thing we're seeing, of course, is the currency translation effect. But in terms of the impact, what's interesting about this business is the economy might affect it, but our growth rates are so strong. We grew 5% organically in 2009, which was, of course, was a terrible year globally.","And so, I think what's happening in the UK is a combination of all of our innovations with a very, very strong team is really coming together for us, from reference lab to in-house, the launch of SediVue at the London Vet Show. It's very exciting. I mean, it's a great team and they really are clicking on all cylinders. And so we don't really see any \u2013 I don't think we really \u2013 I don't know if we could even tell if there was an economic impact, but we certainly haven't seen any in our numbers.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Good morning, Jon.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First of all, Brian, maybe for you. If you can just talk to the normalized 70 bps and expected op margin expansion in 2017 versus, I think, you called out normalized of about 100 bps in 2016. Really just trying to figure out if maybe that's a sense of conservatism or why the op margin expansion would be slightly less than 2017. Arguably, you're leveraging the direct sales force, and I also think you'll have a lower mix in instrument revs in 2017 versus 2016. Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, those are great points. The 70 bps is basically right at the midpoint of the range that we've been highlighting, the 50 to 100 basis points. There's a little bit of foreign exchange headwind that's taken it down slightly. This is our preliminary guidance. I think we feel good about trends in the business and we do have positive drivers. As you've noted, we feel comfortable at this point with that outlook.","I would highlight, Jon, that we've made significant progress this year reducing inventories, and there's a bit of an absorption headwind that goes along with that. It's a good news story from a cash flow and business management point of view. It's just there's some temporal impacts on the margin side. We'll peel all of this apart more at year-end. But, I think we're comfortable that we're on track with our long-term goals and can build on the strong operating margin improvements that we had this year.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, Jon, I would also say that, reinforcing Brian's comments, we're very focused on things like gross margin improvement in our businesses, labs, and the VetLab business being the largest one, and some operating expense leverage, but we're also \u2013 the growth is a good thing. Organic growth is a good thing, and so we don't want to constrain investments that are going to generate enduring organic revenue growth. So, when you take it all together, that's our first step for 2017.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect, very helpful. And maybe, Jon, just to sort of follow-up on that. You mentioned I think the 40 professionals added over, I believe you said the last six months, sort of maybe a plus 12% count of the sales force in North America. I believe now it totals 375. Can you just give some details where those reps were added as a broad base? Are they specialists? And then when we look forward, do you think that it really right-sizes where you need to be with the organization? Thanks, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you for that question. They were in two primary areas. One is we have an elite group of professional service veterinarians. We have literally hired the best across the industry, and we are now at a full complement of 23. These are field-based professional service veterinarians that run dinner meetings, run CE, call on customers, talk about the benefit of things like SDMA and our clinical advantages, talk about the importance of adding urinalysis to the minimum database and supporting SediVue. And we now have a full complement of one per region, which reduces their size of geography and allows them to be highly productive. We think it's a really important part of the fact that we're bringing new clinical differentiation to the industry.","The other area is an amazing group of field of support representatives. These are typically very highly capable, either lead technicians of very large practices or practice managers, and we have now moved to 89 of those in place and they are set-up to be one for every two VDC territory, so several per region. And this, of course, shrinks their territories and allows them to be more productive. These are essential in things like our two-way integration and the integration of SNAP Pro, the adoption of VetConnect PLUS, but of course, they are involved in instrument installations and lab on-boarding. They're not commissioned. They get great \u2013 rave reviews from our customers when they show up, because they provide a lot of value, and they're completely unique to the model of someone in our category of bringing value to the customer.","So, those were really the two areas that we filled out to get to a set that matches our regions and our veterinary diagnostic territory managed coverage.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And, Jon, to your question, I think we're heading towards a good place in terms of our staffing levels. There'll be some year-over-year carryover as we increase some of the levels this year. I would highlight that we do have some enabling investments going on. As we're expanding the team, we've got an investment in a CRM system that we're putting in place, HRS system. So, it's all within our outlook for margin improvement, but we do have some enabling investments that we're advancing in parallel.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And then I might just finally add that, even with those investments, we've achieved nice leverage in our operating expense in Q3 in the U.S. CAG business.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. First one from me in terms of 2017 organic growth guidance. I know you'll provide more specifics on the segments, I believe, in January or February when you report full year. But I just wanted to get a better understanding of just some of the other segments, Water, LPD. Obviously, Water has been quite strong this year. LPD moderated a bit in 3Q. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding of, if we look at that organic growth guidance for the full year next year, is there any change in terms of CAG outside of just instrument dynamics that we should be aware of or is the \u2013 perhaps the slight deceleration year-over-year on organic growth more attributed to the other segments versus CAG? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We, obviously, will get more into the color by modality on the year-end call. We did highlight a few things today just as color. One was, we are anticipating continued strong CAG recurring diagnostic growth, which is the key driver of our business. As you noted, we'll be up against some tougher compares on instruments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","SediVue launch.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, the SediVue launch post-Q1. And we did note that LPD is trending relatively softer. We're seeing good growth in expansion regions and in emerging markets. But, I think the long awaited kind of slowdown in the disease eradication testing in Europe, we're seeing \u2013 quote \u2013 the numbers and there has been a lower level of health herd screening testing, which is into China primarily, and that is a small business, but a little more volatile relatively in the contrast of our overall. So, those were just the factors we're highlighting. But net-net, I think it's much more of a consistent growth story.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, and I want to thank you for calling out our Water business. They had yet another great quarter. I think we have a very entrepreneurial team, very focused on our customers. They've done a great job this year. And we continue to see \u2013 there's a good market for our core products in Water in the U.S. and around the world. And so, just an awesome business with \u2013 it's 95% recurring revenue, 99%-plus, 99.5%; 99.9% customer loyalty and retention and mid-40s operating margin. That's a great business for us.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then my second question would be on net price realization. It seems like you guys have made some real progress over the last couple of quarters as you've navigated through this commercial reorganization. But I think that 2% to 3% has been the strongest and sometimes \u2013 I just wanted to get a little bit more \u2013 a better understanding on kind of sustainability. Obviously that has positive ramifications as you think about gross margin improvement longer term. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I think there's two things that really are benefiting from the fact that customers are appreciating that IDEXX's offering and diagnostics is very unique. And it's unique because the innovations first and only innovations that we brought to the market that customers are adopting. So, we see an improved customer retention that I mentioned, and the flip side of the coin is we see it in modest price realization. We offer SDMA at no incremental charge as part of the standard reference lab panel. This allows us to get some modest price differentiation, because it's now highly differentiated offering and a major part of the reference lab offering. So, I think those two dynamics are two good things that are consequence of the adoption of the innovation by our customers.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. My first is on the rate of international growth that you have in your forecast for 2017. Obviously, you had a blowout Q2, 18% premium placement revenue growth in Q3. Is it reasonable for us to model in double-digit instrument growth in 2017, or do you think you're more likely to come in a hair below that?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, I don't really want to talk about \u2013 we're not just ready to talk about details of the different parts of the P&L in 2017. I think it's pretty amazing actually we give 2017 guidance. I don't think too many companies actually do that. But what I will say with regard to international is it'll benefit from the SediVue launch. Most of the SediVue launches \u2013 two important countries, UK and Australia, are happening in Q4. Obviously, they'll really get rolling in 2017, but we'll be launching SediVue around the world over the course of 2017. So, that will be a nice contributing factor to international's performance.","Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","We feel very good about the trends internationally. We'll, obviously, be up against some very strong numbers on the Catalyst placements this year. So just on a reported, we're looking to sustain strong performance, but I think the growth rates, that'll obviously be something we'll factor into the outlook.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","And I'll also mention, as I mentioned earlier, that about a third of our Companion Animal Group revenues are outside the U.S. In terms of the SediVue opportunity, obviously, the big opportunity is the launch that we had in the U.S. or North America. And so the opportunity for SediVue is going to be smaller international, just as the entire market opportunity is small.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then as a follow-up to SediVue, was wondering if you could comment about where you expect to launch beginning in 2017 beyond UK and Australia. I have to imagine it's probably across other European countries, where you're direct would be my guess and perhaps in maybe Brazil or other faster-growing territories. Any color there would be helpful.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Obviously, we're going to be \u2013 what I'll make as a general comment, the countries where we have more experience, more \u2013 where we're direct, that are larger, these are the markets that we'll roll out first. UK and Australia, obviously, are characteristic of that. They're also, of course, English language countries. And we'll be rolling \u2013 it rolls out over the course of 2017.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, most of my questions have already been asked, so I'll just do the one I have left on SediVue. Can you talk about the way you're looking at utilization in existing in-house chemistry accounts? Sort of asked another way, do you have an initial revenue per Catalyst estimate that you're looking at with the increase of the SDMA slide?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","So, yeah. So, they are related. Okay? SediVue, we think the \u2013 the early data that we're showing is the $3,000 to $4,500 per analyzer placement. And on SDMA on a slide, we're still a year away from launch, and we will be charging, of course, for the slide. So, it will be a source of revenue. But we're still quite a ways from that. It won't be a meaningful contributor to 2017 revenue, given the launch will be in the fourth quarter of the year.","But what I will tell you is it's bringing a tremendous amount of excitement to not only our existing Catalyst base, but to those customers who are considering upgrading to a Catalyst from their current analyzer, be it an IDEXX VetTest or competitive analyzer. And many of those customers are using IDEXX reference labs already and getting the benefit of SDMA.","And then, to know that they could also use SDMA on their in-house lab if they upgraded to an IDEXX Catalyst is \u2013 and to know that that's going to happen in 2017, I think will be beneficial to our competitive Catalyst placements leading up to that launch date.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Great. And just a quick follow-up on that. Do you think that you're going to see an increase in SDMA spend as we anticipate the SDMA launch?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","I'm sorry. Ask that question again.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Do you anticipate increasing your sales and marketing spend on SDMA in anticipation of the launch on the Catalyst?","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","No. I don't think \u2013 I think we're \u2013 what we've talked about in terms of a great field force that we have today supplemented by the professional service veterinarians and the expansion that we've now completed was really an amazing group. The best of the best in the industry have decided to come to IDEXX, because we're by far the most innovative company in the U.S. market, regardless of what product lines.","There's more to talk about with IDEXX, and that's what is exciting, is actually changing the course of veterinary medicine. And so, we're already, I think, well facilitated to launch the SDMA on a slide with the resources that we have in place today.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will go the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Can you speak to sort of the opportunity associated with that CRP launch that you mentioned that's going to launch in the first quarter? Are the contributions embedded in your long-term guidance or is this incremental? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. CRP is a really interesting test, but the test is well understood and appreciated in certain international markets. And, Erin, in the long term, we don't see any reason why it couldn't be appreciated in all markets, because after all dogs and cats are the same around the world in terms of inflammatory markets, but it's not as appreciated in the U.S. Our focus in the U.S. is going to be on the assays that we already have in the market, things like SDMA and fecal antigen. But we're going to be offering the slide.","A point is there are certain international markets where CRP has already been adopted. And so, we're going to be launching it worldwide, but it is not going to be \u2013 we don't believe it to be a material at all, or a meaningful contributor to our recurring revenue. It will be an incremental value to the Catalyst in placements in these international markets that already see the value of CRP. And in the long term, we have the opportunity of expanding the appreciation of CRP in other markets including the U.S.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then one last one. How are your relationships with corporate teams progressing? Any updates on your relationship with Banfield, NVA or other chains out there? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you. I think we have \u2013 really we don't comment on individual customers, but we have outstanding relationships. It's interesting. The corporate accounts appreciate the value of our differentiators as much as the individual accounts on two dimensions. The first is these help them to grow their revenue. And second of all, their doctors are seeing the changing standard of cares that we're bringing to the industry and they want to make their doctors happy.","And so, we have a great corporate account team, which, by the way, isn't even included in the 375. It's another group of very experienced IDEXX field professionals. And I think there's really no individual comment I would have. So I'd say, I think our corporate account team is executing very well. We are also doing that around the world. There are corporate accounts in markets around the world and we are attending to their needs.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the speakers for any closing comment.","Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.","Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody's addition to the \u2013 coming on to the call. As I said, our company is executing on all key dimensions. And I just continue to be amazed by our employees' innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, and continue to believe that our unique IDEXX culture consists \u2013 that this entrepreneurial spirit is one of our most competitive advantages. So, I want to thank all of our employees for yet another great quarter and for the work that we're doing to expand the standard of care and support veterinarians in their quest to support the health and well-being of the pets and the families that love them around the world.","So with that, we're going to conclude the call.

As reported in our press release this morning, our third quarter revenues were $315.5 million, yielding organic growth of 6% and diluted earnings per share were $0.76, a year-to-year increase of 15%. Organic revenue growth was a couple of points or so below our expectation at the time of our July call, primarily the result of lower revenues from instruments and from our livestock and poultry business. ","Earnings per share were essentially in line with our expectations as lower spending mitigated the gross profit impact of the revenue shortfall. While currency was slightly more favorable to reported revenues in our thinking in July, the impact to earnings per share was immaterial.","As for what we are seeing in the US veterinary market based on data from approximately 500 customers using our Cornerstone Practice Management System. In the third quarter, patient visits grew by 3.5% and practice revenues grew by 6%. These metrics are relatively consistent with what we saw in the second quarter, with patient visit growth of 4% and practice revenue growth of 5.5%. The consistency of the second and third quarter data once further validation to the hypothesis that the strong first quarter metrics of 5% patient visit growth and 7% practice revenue growth were favored by the mild winter weather experienced in much of the country. ","In Europe overall we saw organic growth for our companion animal group of businesses hold steady at 5%, consistent with the first half of the year. The countries, primarily in southern Europe that are experiencing the greatest fiscal issues, are showing relatively lower growth, however we are seeing solid growth in Germany and strong growth in more emerging markets in eastern Europe. ","For the balance of 2012 and into 2013 we remain cautious about the impact of the macro environment in both the US and Europe and the markets served by our core businesses. Europe continues to be fragile and in the US mixed economic data indicates that the fundamentals are not strong. ","Asia-Pacific is a different story. The stronger economies and the relatively less mature markets have provided a tailwind to our innovation and commercial execution to produce 20% growth year-to-date collectively across our businesses. Implicit in our guidance today is a very modest benefit from the macro environment on volume growth over the next few quarters. And so, as over the past three or so years, our growth will largely be driven by our innovation and ability to build strong value-based partnerships with our customers. ","Let me now give some further detail on the top line performance of our companion animal group. VetLab instruments and consumable revenue of $101.3 million grew 4% organically. Sales of instruments at $21.7 million declined 10% organically year-to-year. As we noted last quarter, the success of our protocol-based rebate program that was introduced in the third quarter of last year in North America makes for difficult comparison in the second half of this year, but particularly for the third quarter. And accordingly we had anticipated a year-to-year decline in unit chemistry placements. Nonetheless total chemistry placements which were down 14% year-to-year and relatively flat sequentially were a bit below our expectations. Though we had a strong finish to the quarter in September, we could not make up completely for the slow start experienced early on. This strong finish has given us a healthy order backlog and some positive momentum heading into the fourth quarter. ","Despite the shortfall in quantity, we continue to be pleased with the quality of the placements in the quarter. As experienced through the first half of the year, roughly 40% of the Catalyst placements were into accounts new to IDEXX, both in the US and Europe. This comparable metric in the second half of 2011 was 30%. One more selling effort is required to place an instrument into a greenfield or competitive account, the overall value to us of a new placement is 4 to 5 times that of an upgrade of vet [ph] customer as measured by the gross profit on the instrument placement and 5-year consumable streams for an average Catalyst placement. We now expect 2012 Chemistry placement growth to be a point or two shy of our previous projection of 5%. ","We continue to see strong performance in our worldwide ProCyte placements, up nearly 20% over last year. Over one-third of ProCyte placements were into accounts new to IDEXX, a solid metric giving us relatively recent launch. As we have stated before, ProCyte does help us place Catalyst into large new customers. In the third quarter, half of our ProCyte placements also included a Catalyst. We have seen that these Catalyst accounts use roughly 50% more consumables than the average Catalyst customer who does not have a ProCyte. We expect combined ProCyte and LaserCyte hematology placement growth to be around 15% for the full year.","Consumable revenues of $67.7 million grew organically 10% or 9% when further normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. This is consistent with the 9% growth we saw in the first half of the year, a function of our growing installed base increased testing as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-clinic labs with Catalyst and ProCyte and increased same-store testing as a result of improving patient visit metrics. With regard to the installed base, given our placement success with Catalyst over the 4.5 year since launch, we now see that in the US over 80% of our Chemistry consumable sales, exclusive of corporate account are to Catalyst owners of very loyal base. We continue to expect full-year 2012 normalized organic growth for instrument consumables to be 9% to 10%.","Our third quarter rapid assay sales of $39.3 million grew organically 10%. When normalized further for changes in distributor inventory levels, revenues grew by 6%. This growth is largely consistent with the second quarter and our thinking at the time of our July call. And we continue to expect normalized organic growth to be 4% to 6% for the full year for rapid assay as we anniversary the list price increase we took in the fourth quarter of last year. ","US distributor inventories for instrument consumables and rapid assays averaged just under four weeks at the end of the third quarter based on forward-looking demand, which is within their normal and customary range. Our reference laboratory and consulting services business with revenues of $101.4 million grew organically 7% in the third quarter. Though it gets lost in whole number rounding, we saw nearly 50 basis point improvement in growth from our second quarter organic growth, with sequentially higher growth rates in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific. The majority of growth continues to come from higher test volumes due to the addition of new customers. Our accounts acquisition success is fostered by a number of factors, namely our growth specialty test menu which now includes allergy testing with our second quarter launch in the US. Our ability to effectively bundle our lab and in-clinic offering greatly enhanced with the decision support and client communication capabilities of VetConnect PLUS also launched in the second quarter and our geographic footprint expansion to increase market coverage. ","As per geographic expansion, we have opened up two new labs since our July call which bring our worldwide network to 60. Most notably, our new lab in Germany which we mentioned on our second quarter call was successfully opened in early October. To remind you, this new German lab will serve as a centralized hub for testing samples picked up by our European logistics partner from customers outside of major metropolitan areas. The lab and logistics combination will open up new markets for us in areas of Europe where we do not have lab presence today. It will also allow us to consolidate evening testing from our existing European labs to take advantage of scale economies. This replicates the successful strategy we have employed in the US through our Memphis lab and will greatly enhance our reach and service levels across Europe. ","We are in a controlled launch in the fourth quarter to ensure smooth operations and the superior customer experience with broader commercial activity gearing up in the first quarter of next year. Consistent with our thinking in July, we expect reference lab and consulting services revenue growth of 8% to 9% for the full year. ","Our practice management and digital imaging systems with revenues of $20.3 million, grew organically by 11% in the third quarter. These results are consistent with our thinking in July and so we are maintaining our expectation for low to mid teen organic revenue growth for this line for the full year. WE have focused a good deal of our innovation efforts in this area of technology in recent quarters, and Jon will be speaking in greater detail about this in his remarks. Suffice to say that we are developing some information based offerings that we believe will be differentiated and value added in their own ride and will also enhance the value and utilization of the rest of our product in service offerings among our veterinary customers. ","Our livestock and poultry diagnostic revenues declined 2% organically to $18.9 million in the third quarter, which as we noted upfront was lower than our expectation for mid-single-digit growth. The primary drivers for this shortfall versus our thinking in July were lower swine testing in Asia which we believe is due in part to the suppressed port prices in the region. Lower cattle testing in Europe which may be in part timing between the third and fourth quarters and slower ramp of a couple of recently introduced products. In light of the third quarter performance and continuation of some of these factors into the fourth quarter, we are now expecting that livestock and poultry organic growth for the full year will be negative in the low single-digits, down from our expectation of flat growth in July. ","Our water business had sales of $22.2 million for the quarter for organic growth of 5%. We continue to see growth driven by gains in our core Colilert testing business worldwide. As third quarter performance was in line with our thinking, we are maintaining our expectations for mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin at 54% of revenue was in line with our expectations. Operating expenses at 34% of revenue as mentioned were somewhat below our thinking in July, reflecting lower discretionary spending and to a lesser extent some timing between quarters. Our effective tax rate of 31.4% was in line with our expectations and a bit below the prior two quarters due to the release of reserves in conjunction with the expiration of certain statues to limitation. Share count was also largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. ","As for the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $221 million of cash and $235 million of debt for a net debt position of $13 million. Our inventory balance of $147 million was about $4 million higher than the level at the end of the second quarter, primarily a function of the somewhat lower-than-expected Instrument and Poultry and Livestock revenues.","We expect inventory levels to come down modestly during the fourth quarter. DSO at 42 days remains in good shape and our free cash flow was $60 million or 140% of net income. For full-year 2012, we project revenues of approximately $1.3 billion. Our revenue guidance implies the reported growth rate of about 6.5%, which translates to an organic growth rate of about 7.5%. Organic growth for the year has reduced from our previous range of 8% to 9%, reflecting our latest thinking of our Instruments and Livestock and Poultry revenues.","We continue to project growth margin to be approximately 54% for the year and operating expenses to be approximately 34%. With respect to operating expenses, we expect a modest increase in spending in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting investments we are making in areas such as the full commercial launch of Pet Health Network Pro and the startup of the German lab. In addition, we are making some investments to improve our commercial effectiveness in the Scandinavian region of Europe. ","We are increasing our full-year earnings per share projection to $3.08 to $3.11 compared to our July guidance of $3.05 to $3.10. The $0.01 increase as a high end of our range is a result of favorable impact of currency relative to rates assumed at the time of our July earnings call.","The details on currency rates implicit in our guidance and our currency rate change sensitivity metrics for both 2012 and 2013 are included in our earnings press release. As we look to 2013, we project revenues of $1.405 billion to $1.425 billion, a year-to-year increase of 8% to 9% for both reported and organic growth, and earnings per share of $3.37 to $3.47, a reported growth of 8% to 13%. As the currency rates we are assuming for 2013 are relatively on par with projected average rates for 2012, currency is expected to have an immaterial impact on 2013 reported revenue growth.","As mentioned, our projected 2013 revenue guidance contemplates only a modest favorable impact on our served markets from a gradual improvement in the economy. The 8% to 9% organic growth will largely be driven by continued enhancements to our product and service offerings and by further leveraging the innovations launched over the last few years.","We believe we have a unique opportunity within the veterinary industry to partner with our customers on solutions that promote both their clinical and business practice effectiveness. Our commercial organization along with our distribution partners are discovering how to put together the pieces of our multi-faceted strategy in a way that is compelling to veterinarians and then staff. These pieces include our broad, deep and complementary real-time and reference lab diagnostic offerings, made more valuable by the information insights enabled by VetConnect PLUS. Additionally, both VetConnect PLUS and Pet Health Network Pro provide veterinarians\u2019 tools for more effective communication and outreach to their clients.","We are as energized about our opportunities to innovate commercially as we are about our products and service innovation. While currency is anticipated to have a minimal impact on revenue growth, our earnings per share guidance contemplates roughly $0.09 of headwind from 2012, for foreign exchange hedging that are not projected to recur in 2013 based on 2013 hedges in place and FX rates assumed in our guidance.","Were we to normalize for this year-to-year change in the impact of hedges, earnings per share growth would be 11% to 16% and operating margin expansion from productivity initiative primarily in our reference lab and vet lab businesses would be in the range of the 50 basis points to 100 basis points we have been targeting on an annual basis.","We are still in the midst of our annual internal planning process, and so, we will provide more details on the components of our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow at the time of our earnings call in January.","As one final point, both our 2012 and 2013 guidance does not incorporate any benefits from the federal R&D tax credit. And now, I would like to turn over to Jon for some further comments on the business.","Jonathan Ayers","","Okay, thank you, Merilee. We could be more excited about our progress with our innovations at IDEXX, especially in the last quarter. In the Companion Animal Group, we have very strong base in our diagnostic offerings, including a world-class reference lab network and a set of in-house diagnostic capabilities that are unmatched.","We have discussed in the past calls our steady stream of advancements in menu and ease-of-use for the in-house equipment and kits, as well as geographic and expansion on the reference lab side. We continue to develop new enhancements and commercialize the ones we have already released. But what is new is how we are transforming diagnostics with information technology, using the latest software development tools.","In early Q3, as investors know, we formally launched VetConnect PLUS, a cloud-based application that provides the practicing veterinarian access to integrated diagnostic results for each individual patient, from blood analyzed by either our reference lab or our in-house equipment or both. VetConnect PLUS has a highly intuitive interface that allows for analysis of the patient\u2019s most recent blood work data in the context of all of their historical data run on IDEXX. This time-based analysis with the support of intuitive graphing tools provides far, deeper insight into a patient\u2019s health status.","As financial analysts, think of how much more value is derived from looking at trends overtime versus data from just a single period. In addition, because our diagnostic data is in the cloud as soon as the results are available from either in-house equipment or the reference lab, this information is available real time anywhere, at any moment, opening up the obvious value of mobile computing to a veterinarian.","For example, the fact that they can see blood work completed on their patients with their in-house hospital equipment, when they are at home or otherwise away from the practice and then can easily email these results to the client. That is, VetConnect PLUS results are easily shared electronically with pet owners or other veterinarians that might be involved in the care of vet patient.","VetConnect PLUS is transforming the practice of management, and the validation is the rate of adoption by our veterinary customers as Q3 progressed. We now have 2,300 customers that have activated their VetConnect PLUS account, an extremely rapid pace for our market and in the context of anything we have seen in the past.","In addition, over 25% of the IDEXX results that are viewed online in the U.S. are now viewed using VetConnect PLUS as powerful analytic tools. We expect that metrics to be 100% within a year, and we expect a significant increase in the overall use of our online tools for viewing and analyzing blood work results from either in-house or reference lab modalities. ","In this way, we are bringing to the market today the future of diagnostics. Our business model here is to offer VetConnect PLUS to our customers of IDEXX diagnostics including in-house users and reference lab users for no incremental charge. Of course, VetConnect PLUS only works with IDEXX diagnostic offerings and can only do so.","The feedback we are receiving from veterinarians who start using VetConnect PLUS ranges from positive to very enthusiastic. Once they start using it, they never want to access their patient\u2019s results any other way. It is a transformative experience. Thus, we expect VetConnect PLUS will further increase our already high customer loyalty, allow for greater cross-selling on in-house equipment to our reference lab customers and lab services to our in-house installed base, as well as present a unique value proposition to accounts that do not currently use either.","Over the longer term, we also expect that VetConnect PLUS will support greater adoption of diagnostic testing for preventive care, as the importance of establishing individual patient base lines become so obvious through the intuitive graphing and trending tools of VetConnect PLUS. This blood work presentation is not only intuitive to the veterinarian and her staff, but also to pet owners where they can see trends easily through a simple graph on a tabular or exam room screen.","As we know, the growth in the adoption of preventive care diagnostics is a quadruple win. It\u2019s great for patients and pet owners, for veterinary practices and of course, for utilization of IDEXX diagnostics.","Today, VetConnect PLUS is only available in the U.S. However, in 2013, we have plans to bring it to many of our important international markets, which help us augment the already impressive growth rate we are realizing in these markets today. ","In Q3, we also released the latest version of software for our Cornerstone practice management system as well as the beta version of Pet Health Network Pro, our new suite of client communication services. That like VetConnect PLUS are developed using cloud-based technology. Pet Health Network Pro is currently in a large-scale beta testing with anticipated full commercial launch in Q4, when we will start realizing monthly subscription revenues associated with the offering.","Customer response has been as enthusiastic as has been for VetConnect PLUS. From a customer perspective, each of these three, our software offerings, VetConnect PLUS, Pet Health Network Pro and Cornerstone offers clear value to our customers in its own right. These software offerings were also designed to be extremely complementary, as customers can use them together in an easy, seamless way. For example, it\u2019s easy to share IDEXX lab results from VetConnect PLUS with a pet owner on Pet Health Network\u2019s individual client page called Pet Link [ph]. It\u2019s also easy to share pet exam reports that veterinarian has created in Cornerstone on Pet Link, and VetConnect PLUS is also fully integrated into Cornerstone in the latest release.","The customer response to the seamless integration capability has been overwhelming at our Cornerstone User Conference, which was attended by more than 500 of the profession\u2019s most progressive customers. In addition, all these information tools help our customers gain more value from our core diagnostics offering of reference labs and in-house equipment and kits, and that spurs greater demand for diagnostics by pet owners.","Switching topics here, I also wanted to provide a quick update on the FTC situation, which is progressing as we had expected when we first announced our plans to make one of our distributors non-exclusive. As you know, we are very pleased to have signed a new non-exclusive agreement with MWI at the end of September that takes effect then in January. And we are now negotiating a consent agreement with the FTC staff that will formally end the almost three-year FTC investigation.","We expect that the principal element of a consent agreement will be a requirement that we maintain a non-exclusive relationship with at least one national distributor for a period of 10 years, such as we have with MWI, starting in 2013. To be clear, the MWI agreement that we signed in September would satisfy our obligations under the consent agreement.","In fact, this MWI agreement was reviewed by the FTC staff before we executed it, because we and MWI wanted to ensure that it would be satisfactory to the staff. We hope to have the consent agreement signed within the next few weeks, but obviously we don\u2019t have full control over the timing. Following execution, the consent agreement would be presented to the commissioners for FTC approval.","Again, we can\u2019t guarantee that the commission would approve the consent agreement, but our expectation is that they would support the recommendation of the FTC staff. If all goes according to plan, this whole process could be concluded in late Q4 or early Q1 of 2013.","In summary, we believe we are ushering in a new era in the usage of diagnostics and veterinary medicine, building on our strong platforms and point-of-care and reference labs, with an information ecosystem that enables our customers to rapidly advance for standard pet medical care. We have a fairly rapid innovation cycle in veterinary medicine because we do not have many of the constraints of human medicine, such as some specific constraining regulations and third-party payers.","And we have the benefit that pet owners care deeply about their four-legged family members and are willing to invest in their care, when the value of doing so is clear and intuitive. Our veterinary customers that lead the profession by having adoptive or advanced technologies are showing in veterinary medicine the way it could be in all of medicine. ","And I want to thank all of our employers for helping make that happen and the work that they do every day as well as our shareholders for their continued confidence by pursuing this purpose, and that in doing so, we will create exceptional long-term value.","So, with that, Gale, I would open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We will go the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair, please go ahead.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Thanks for taking my question first. I know you don\u2019t want to get into the details exactly on 2013 guidance at this point on all the nuances. But I am curious, if you can talk a little bit more about some of the nuances with the new distribution agreement in regards to you getting higher margin of that and how you reinvest proceeds? I am curious, if it will go, not proceeds but margin, will it go into more R&D, more direct sales and marketing, just how are you thinking about that at this point?","Jonathan Ayers","I will just remind, thanks for the question Ryan, and just to remind investors, as we expected that the new agreement with MWI would transitioned to 10% margin for them, or say a targeted margin based on the retail price or clinic price of our products from 15%. So there would be 5% margin there. It\u2019s hard to say because it\u2019s really a mixture of a lot of different things, money is fungible, and it\u2019s probably a combination of everything that you mentioned. ","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess I might follow just on the VetLab instrument placements, I know you mentioned there is a little bit of weakness and I know the summer months might be a weaker quarter versus Q4 anyways, but anything in particular you are seeing there, you know more competitive pressures, is it more of a focus on kind of selling and launching all the new products you have had, just any color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","Yes, I think the market is fine and I don\u2019t really see the competitive pressure, it\u2019s a very competitive market of course, I don\u2019t really see it any different in Q3 than it was in prior quarters. We did have a lot of new launches and we had some management that \u2013 new management, managements that changed position in the first part of the quarter. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a transitory thing. I also reinforce Merilee\u2019s point that we had a very strong instrument placement in quarter last year, so the year-over-year compares is a little bit tough. Instrument placements can have very strong quarters and quarters like Q3, but we are very excited about the momentum and we are also excited about the quality of our placements. Quality can be measured in a couple of dimensions. One is the percent of new customers and Merilee mentioned that, the 40% for the Catalyst placements, and the second is the size of the customers. We are continuing to win big customers. For example, we completed outfitting the Animal Medical Center in New York City, which is the world\u2019s -- probably largest and most well-known veterinary practice and now it is all IDEXX with Cornerstone that went into Q3, we have a lab there, they have our in-house equipment. It\u2019s a great example of the kind of big accounts that we are winning. If you look at Q3, one of the things that we are very pleased about is the continued momentum in the core annuity portion of the business that is the consumables and the labs. That just continued to power along as you heard from the metrics from Merilee. So, that gives us confidence with the outlook.","Ryan Daniels - William Blair","Great, thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffray, please go ahead.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Yes, hi, good morning Jon and Merilee. So my first question is on the 2013 guidance. Just given the macro environment that we are seeing, the distributor change, and the decelerating growth we have seen through 2012, just want to try to get a little bit more comfortable with the outlook here. Can you give us some additional details just on the acceleration in organic growth?","Merilee Raines","Sure, David. I will take a stab at that and Jon may add some things as well. Of course, in January we will get into more detail by product line, but I would say at a higher level there are a few things that are driving that step-up in organic growth. First, we do expect that the information innovation such as VetConnect PLUS and Pet Health Network Pro will generate volume growth both via account acquisition and also an increase in account loyalty. And as well, because of the value of those offerings bring to our entire portfolio we will see increased price realization. In addition, we will have some favorability or we expect some favorability in price as we anniversary to ramp-up some marketing programs, programs such as the protocol-based rebate program that we launched in the third quarter of last year that\u2019s driving the top instrument placement compare, and that program negatively impacted the price of VetLab consumables the way the accounting treatment works, and as well the instrument and lab bundled programs negatively impacted the pricing on our reference lab business and I think we alluded to that in the last couple of quarters. ","We expect some acceleration in growth from geographic expansion. An example of that is the new hub lab in Germany, which will extend our reach in Europe. More generally, we see opportunity for growth internationally from investments that we are making in commercial resources, I just mentioned that we are making the investment to go direct in Scandinavia and also the investments in recent product launches as we roll those out internationally things like ProCyte was just launched a couple of quarters ago, our last quarter Q2 in Japan and so that\u2019s still got a nice growth ramp to it. As Jon mentioned, VetConnect PLUS we intend to bring out internationally next year. So, those are just some of things that would be behind that step-up in organic growth from 2013.","Jonathan Ayers","I think it is important question, Dave, and I really appreciate it. In addition to the factors that Merilee has mentioned, you mentioned that the change in the US distribution, I think it is important to recognize, as Merilee mentioned in her prepared comments that 80% of our Chemistry consumables that are served by the market that distribution serves, you take out corporate accounts, 80% of those even today and if that percentage continues to grow is what Catalyst chemistry analyzes. The loyalty we have on Catalyst is over 99%. It\u2019s hard to get much better than that. People love Catalyst, they love everything about it, and in addition when they start using VetConnect PLUS, they are going to love it even more. It\u2019s a very, very loyal customer base and the vast majority of our consumables today are actually coming from that portion of the Chemistry base. ","In addition, we have a couple of hundred reps in the field. We have three times that number of distributor reps. We have a wonderful relationship with all of our US distributors, including a continuing strategic relationship with MWI, particularly because they are also helping us with the Cornerstone software. So, really, the changes is really a minor aspect when you look at the -- first of all, the innovation we are bringing in the market, the situation that we have and of course the breadth of go-to-market channels and assets that we use to commercialize our product. So, we are very excited about 2013.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks a lot. As a follow-up from me, I was curious, given the new software launches that we have seen recently, can you parse the performance at digital radiography versus practice management?","Jonathan Ayers","They both grew but the practice management was clearly the lead horse in that low double-digit growth of that product line.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with Bank of America, please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First I guess on the international side, can you give us an update there and the opportunities there? I know you talked about a little bit already, but the Germany lab I guess seems on track or even ahead of schedule. Did that actually have an impact on the current quarter\u2019s results and that\u2019s embedded in your guidance, right?","Jonathan Ayers","It is embedded in our guidance and I think we are very pleased with -- I want to say 5% organic growth in Europe for our Companion Animal business and no impact from the new lab because it actually didn\u2019t start operating until this month, October, and it\u2019s really just starting to crank up. So, we really see it being a 2013 contributor, but we are very pleased because it is in operation. It was a significant investment but a core lab and using a new logistics network. We know how to do it, we have been very successful with Memphis which didn\u2019t exist 4 years ago, it\u2019s now our largest lab in North America and so we are using that model for serving Continental Europe.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Okay, great. And then as it relates to the distributor changes, and I guess MWI, do you anticipate any material changes in ordering patterns from MWI?","Jonathan Ayers","No.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Ross Taylor with CL King, please go ahead.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates","Hi, just two simple questions. VetConnect PLUS, I know it\u2019s in very early days, but I just wondered if you can see any changes in behavior or kind of utilization of diagnostic test by the vets who are using it at this point? My second question relates to Pet Health Network Pro. I just wondered if you expect any material revenue contribution from that product in 2013?","Jonathan Ayers","Okay, those are two great questions, thanks. On VetConnect PLUS we do believe it has the potential to drive diagnostic utilization, as I said in my upfront comments. What I will say is in veterinary medicine behavior change happens over time in strong waves but it happens slowly. It plays out slowly. So, we believe that as veterinarians experience a particular case where they are able to see inside from changes in the individual patient\u2019s parameters from the individual reference range but still within the reference range of the species and they are able to make better diagnosis and have pretty fabulous experience with those pets, they and their staff will then have further impetus to go really communicate the value of preventative care diagnostics with pet owners and it is so intuitive with the graphing tool, but that\u2019s going to be a megatrend in my view. I think it is going to be a megatrend in all medicine but we are leading the way in veterinary medicine because we can innovate faster. I think that\u2019s going to be a megatrend that will play out over the next half decade as an example. So, it is a powerful long-term trend but it takes a while for veterinarians to see this. ","What we do know is the clinical basis, the clinical pathologists have been teaching the value of trending for decades. So this is on extremely solid medical ground as far as the academicians and the key opinion leaders are, and it is really just bringing it to practice. On Pet Health Network Pro, it is a great business because it is a subscription-based business and it has the characteristics of a software-as-a-service type business, and it will be contributor to our organic growth, but in the mix of $1.4 billion it is going to be one of the many things that will contribute to our growth, probably won\u2019t be material in and of itself.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will go to the line of Debbie Wang with Morningstar, please go ahead.","Debbie Wang \u2013 Morningstar","Thank you very much for taking my question. One of your competitors has been out there with their new reference lab for about a year now, and I am just wondering on the ground to what degree you\u2019ve noticed anything, or any impact from that?","Jonathan Ayers","I wouldn\u2019t say the competitive environment is any different today than it was 6 months, a year-and-a-half ago. It\u2019s a very competitive environment in the reference lab business. We have one large competitor who is quite confident and capable and we have to compete with them every day, an addition of one lab when you got, I don\u2019t know, probably between the two of us close to 100 labs there is not really -- I don't think we can really see that. But we are excited that we have new elements of clear differentiation with our reference labs with VetConnect PLUS that will give us additional competitive advantage as we go into 2013, both on customer acquisitions, but also customer loyalty. I mentioned the extremely high loyalty we have in the Catalyst. The labs is not as high it is in the \u201890s, mid-90s at loyalty, but if you go from the mid-90s to high-90s in loyalty that change in percentage loyalty you can just add right to your growth all other things being equal. So we are very excited about the lab business.","Debbie Wang \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go to the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company, please go ahead.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Morning, thanks for taking my questions. On the lab side of the business, can you kind of parse out what roughly the percentage was in organic growth that was due to new customer acquisition and then price increases?","Merilee Raines","Ben, approximately 70% of the growth was volume growth and that\u2019s largely due to acquisition of new customers, and then 30% would be price.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay, great. And then as a quick follow-up, with the acquisitions you made in Q4 last year, what do you expect the growth due to acquisitions to be at kind of half below where they have been running at in Q4? Is that a reasonable assumption?","Merilee Raines","","That\u2019s probably about right, yes -- happened in mid-November.","Jonathan Ayers","","Yes, they were mid-quarter.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay, thank you very much.","Jonathan Ayers","","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Nick Jansen - Raymond James","Hi, I know you guys signed a relationship with GREER on allergy in 2Q. Maybe just your initial progress or thoughts on that market as you were live for three months?","Jonathan Ayers","","Yes. We are very pleased with the rollout of allergy. It is actually one of the many contributors to the reference lab growth because it's an entirely new product line for us, and of course, gives us one more element of menu differentiation with the reference lab. And so, I would say that, that is as successful as we have expected to be, and of course, that\u2019s going to be really a global offering because it turns out pets get allergies everywhere, and there is pretty well developed. There\u2019s actually more developed market in allergy in Europe than there is in the U.S. So, we would see that there is an existing business there and then there is the opportunity to develop the allergy business as we go forward in the U.S.","Nick Jansen - Raymond James","And then lastly kind of looking at the lab footprint expansion with Germany in 4Q, if that\u2019s successful, is there something that you could kind of implement in Asia as well to kind of think about that same strategy or it is just too early to talk?","Jonathan Ayers","","Well, I would say, having actually lived in Asia a long time ago, it is a little different geography, it is big. And the nice thing about Germany is you have got continental Europe and you can do the flights relatively straightforward on logistics network, and of course, DHL is well situated. Asia is just about -- it is a vast geographic distances. So, we are excited about Asia, we are excited about the 20% plus organic growth that we achieved in IDEXX in our Asia businesses. And the outlook is good there, but probably how we are going to continue to do that in the lab business will play out over time and probably, I am not sure I would see a core lab for the hemisphere in the same way we have it for North America and the Europe continent.","Nick Jansen - Raymond James","Thanks.","Jonathan Ayers","","Thanks.","Operator","","And we will go to Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti. Please go ahead.","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company","Yes, hi good morning. Just a quick question on the lab business. I was just wondering as you look forward to the next year in terms of the guidance etcetera, are you counting on the growth coming mostly from just taking share or are you also betting that the market will \u2013 you are getting growth from the base business in the overall market?","Merilee Raines","Mitra, we are really not expecting very much growth from the market. As I mentioned, that we are remaining cautious on the economy. So, we are really thinking that growth in the lab business, our business really going to, it is going to come from really the impact of the innovations that we had. So, that can come in the form of acquisition, you know, increased \u2013 customer acquisition, increased customer loyalty and some higher utilization because of the value of the products, but we are not, I guess just to be clear, we are not seeing much impact on our growth from just a pickup in the general economy.","Jonathan Ayers","","Right. And what you might call same-clinic sales or same-store sales, (inaudible), but we are cautious on that and grow as steady as you goes, not worst, but not better than it has been historically. I will say though, if the number of innovations we have at IDEXX is such that don't always bring them up. In the lab business, we introduced a new menu item in October. We are pretty excited about from a medical point of view and that is our complete blood count, CBC, which is on majority of standard profiles that our central lab has got an upgrade and one of its important parameter is (inaudible), which is really again at the forefront of advances in medicine and the value of the CBC. ","So, we are just, it\u2019s that steady stream of new menu innovation that we almost take for granted right now, but each one is pretty exciting in its own rights that continues to set us in unique place in terms of the forefront of veterinarian medicine with our standard lab offering.","Mitra Ramgopal - Sidoti & Company","Sure thing. Thank you very much.","Operator","","We will go the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Hi, just a quick follow-up. You provide, I guess, a metric on the percentage of Catalyst and ProCyte placements that are new customers to IDEXX. Do you have that breakout by geographies?","Merilee Raines","","For Catalysts, that was very consistent across geographies. We saw that in the US. I mean, US and Europe would be the primary, the placement rating in Asia Pacific, relative to the other two is still quite small. And I would have to look up the ProCyte piece on that.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Okay. Great.","Jonathan Ayers","I will say though, speaking of Asia here and strong performance we have, we are very pleased with how Japan did. And part of that was the introduction of ProCyte in Japan, which is actually not surprising. If you think about it being extremely well-received, Japanese are very picky about their medical technology and they really demand the highest standard of excellence and reliability. And of course, ProCyte meets that standard and it's also manufactured in Japan. ","So, we really did have ProCyte and Catalysts and actually even the reference lab in Japan were all contributors to that good growth in Asia Pacific. It was certainly China and Australia and other places were also contributors, but we are in particular pleased with the Companion Animal business in Japan, which is a big market and one that overall our share in diagnostics is substantially lower than it is in other international markets.","Operator","","We have no further questions. I will turn the call back to you, Mr. Ayers for closing comments.","Jonathan Ayers","Well, I want to thank all shareholders and investors for your continued confidence and for attending the call. I also want to take this opportunity again to thank all of our employees who may be listening to the call, and many do, because it is a good opportunity to get an overall update. And it is only because of our employees that we are able to continue to be successfully serving our customers with these kinds of innovations. So, with that, we are going to conclude the call, and we will be talking to you with our fourth quarter results in January.","Operator","","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning. IDEXX had a strong start to 2016 in Q1. Based on our solid performance trends and more favorable projections for foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our full year financial outlook today. In terms of first quarter highlights, we achieved organic revenue growth of 11%, supported by 10% organic growth in the U.S. and 12% organic revenue gains in international markets.","Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues increased 11% organically as benefits from our innovation pipeline and strength in commercial capability supported 15% gains in reference lab revenues and 12% consumable revenue growth globally.","We had another strong quarter in terms of expanding our instrument base with nearly 2,000 premium analyzers placed globally, up 18% from strong prior year levels. Strong top-line growth and better-than-expected operating margin performance supported Q1 EPS of $0.51. On a constant dollar basis, Q1 EPS increased 14%. As expected, foreign exchange was a headwind to reported results, lowering reported revenue growth by 2% and EPS by $0.05 per share, including the impacts from the lapping of 2015 hedge gains.","Foreign currency rates strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar during Q1. Compared to our earlier estimates of exchange rates shared in our January earnings call, this change added about $5 million to Q1 revenue and about $0.01 to EPS.","For the full year 2016, at new exchange rate assumptions shown in our press release, the recent strengthening of foreign currency rates relative to dollar will add approximately $27 million to 2016 revenue and $0.05 to EPS. Along with our stronger-than-expected operational performance, this supported an increase in our full-year revenue and EPS guidance of $40 million and $0.08 per share, respectively. We'll review our updated 2016 outlook later in my comments.","Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Q1 results were supported by strong CAG results and accelerated growth in our Water business. Global CAG revenues were $358 million reflecting 11% organic growth. CAG gains were supported by strong recurring Diagnostic gains across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. As expected, we saw approximately 1% of growth benefit from extra days in the quarter. Favorable U.S. weather comparisons also supported strong CAG performance.","Our Water business grew 11% organically to $24 million supported by double-digit gains in the U.S. and benefits from global commercial investments. Water results also benefited from the extra leap year day and warmer U.S. weather.","Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business grew 4% organically to $31 million benefiting from new product gains, porcine and poultry testing in China, and livestock services testing offsetting expected declines in Western Europe bovine testing associated with successful disease eradication programs.","Overall, U.S. revenues were $259 million in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 9% organically supported by high-single-digit consumable volume gains and high-teen revenue growth in our U.S. Lab business.","Recurring CAG revenue gains continue to be primarily volume-driven. Consistent with trends in Q4 of 2015, we continue to see a moderation of growth in net customer acquisition cost, reflecting our success in differentiating IDEXX's diagnostic technologies from competitive offerings, which should provide benefits to realized net pricing levels moving forward.","U.S. market growth reflected in our data set of 5,200 clinics continues to trend solidly. In Q1, patient visits normalized per equivalent days increased 6.0%, and clinic revenues increased 9.2% overall, supported by double-digit gains in February.","International revenues in the first quarter were $159 million, reflecting 12% organic growth. CAG Diagnostic's recurring revenue growth was 13% in international markets in Q1. These strong results reflect accelerating consumable revenue growth supported by high levels of instrument placements as well as improved lab revenue gains.","Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $23 million, up 16% organically, supported by continued strong growth in premium instrument placements globally, particularly Catalyst One. Globally, we placed 1,157 catalysts and 823 premium hematology analyzers, up 25% and 10%, respectively compared to strong prior-year results. International performance was exceptional, reflected in 1,150 premium instrument placements, up 28% over prior year levels.","In North America, we placed 443 catalysts in total with 258 or 58% going to new and competitive accounts, reflecting our commercial emphasis. These gains and continued improvement in placement retention supported a 15% expansion of our U.S. catalyst instrument base over prior year levels.","Strong placement gains continue to expand our foundation for growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $305 million in Q1, up 11% organically. By modality, instrument consumable revenues of $108 million grew 12% organically, reflecting strong volume-driven gains across all major regions. Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $141 million grew 15% organically in the first quarter, driven by very strong U.S. gains and improved performance in Western Europe. Strong global lab momentum reflects leverage of our expanded commercial capability and benefits from our test menu expansion including SDMA.","Rapid assay revenues decreased 1% organically in Q1 to $43 million. As expected, U.S. Rapid assay revenues were down modestly, reflecting timing of promotional programs and relatively tougher prior-year comparisons. Rapid assay trends over the past two quarters have remained basically consistent with sustained 4Dx volumes and stabilized impacts from competitive first-generation assay products. Customer information management and digital imaging system revenues were $29 million in the quarter, up 14% organically. Solid information management revenue gains were supported by continued penetration of the Cornerstone services in our loyal installed base as we, in parallel, advanced the introduction of our cloud-based Neo platform. Digital revenue growth continued to improve reflecting strong unit sales and benefits from recognition of deferred revenues associated with long-term business commitments.","Turning to the P&L, as expected, the lapping of $4.5 million in 2015 hedge gains and unfavorable year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates had a moderating impact on a reported first quarter financial results. Despite these headwinds, we delivered solid financial performance in the quarter.","Operating profit was $74 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, supported by gains in our CAG segment, which offset FX effects. Please note that our segment reporting now includes a more comprehensive view of the financial performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization of manufacturing variances in operating segment results. These impacts were previously disclosed in unallocated amounts.","Excluding currency impacts, operating profits increased 10%, supported by strong revenue gains. Operating margins of 17.7% were better than expected due to volume leverage and timing of operating expenses, which moderated cost growth in Q1.","Gross profit was $228 million in Q1, up 6% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains, gross profit margins declined approximately 70 basis points, reflecting comparisons to favorable prior year product costs and product mix impacts from higher instrument sales.","For 2016, we had a foreign exchange hedge gain reported in gross profit of approximately $800,000 in Q1. Operating expenses increased 8% in Q1, modestly below revenue growth, reflecting increases in capabilities supporting the U.S. go-direct strategy and global increases in commercial spending advanced through 2015.","As noted, EPS was $0.51 per share, up 4% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency impacts. The federal R&D tax credit, which benefited 2016 but not 2015 first quarter results, had a favorable 2% EPS growth impact.","EPS growth continues to benefit from share repurchases advanced over the last year, supported by our strong free cash flow and optimization of our capital structure, which reduced the average share count year-on-year by approximately 5%.","In Q1, we repurchased over 700,000 shares for $50 million. Absolute levels of share repurchases moderated in Q1 from accelerated levels in recent years as we've achieved debt leverage ratios within our long-term target range. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.2 billion in debt outstanding with an average interest rate of 2.5% and a balanced multiyear tenor. Cash and investment balances were $351 million at quarter-end.","Looking ahead, we're updating our full year guidance today to reflect our strong start to 2016 and favorable changes to foreign exchange rates. We're increasing our 2016 revenue guidance range to $1.73 billion to $1.75 billion, an increase of $40 million. As noted, we're raising our 2016 organic growth guidance to 9% to 10%. We're also incorporating updated FX rates in our outlook, which contributed approximately $27 million to our full year revenue guidance.","At the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release, we now estimate that foreign exchange rates will reduce year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 1%. We're raising our EPS outlook range by $0.08 to $2.18 to $2.25, reflecting closure benefits from higher organic revenue growth and FX changes, offset by a 50-basis-point increase in our expected tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate estimate to 30.5% to 31% reflects updated estimates for higher U.S. profit growth.","In terms of FX impacts at updated exchange rates, we now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce 2016 EPS by approximately $0.21 per share, including net impacts from the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains, compared to projected hedge gains of approximately $2 million in 2016.","We're maintaining our outlook for strong cash flow generation of 95% to 100% of net income this year.","For Q2, we reported revenue gains of 7.5% to 8.5% supported by organic growth of 8% to 9%. In addition to expectations for continued strong CAG recurring diagnostic gains, benefits from the launch of SediVue will mitigate effects from comparisons to very strong prior year instrument placement results.","In terms of the P&L, we expect that operating margins will be approximately 150 basis points to 200 basis points below prior Q2 levels, reflecting impacts from FX operating profit headwinds of approximately $7 million, including the lapping of $5 million and 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains and timing of 2016 operating expenses.","That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Brian. Q1 performance was outstanding and was a result of a combination of factors. First, we achieved strong performance in our commercial organizations in the U.S. and around the world. Second, we are seeing the sustained benefits of a highly innovative line of veterinary diagnostics. Finally, we are seeing generally, favorable market trends, particularly in the U.S.","As we exited the fourth quarter of 2015 with revenue and profit performance that built from Q3 results, I think most concluded that we had indeed successfully completed the transition in the U.S. to our fully direct sales model. With these Q1 results and our revised 2016 organic growth guidance, we are now beginning to see the power of this new sales model and what it can achieve.","We went fully direct because we believe that by being closer to our customers, we could augment revenue growth and adoption of our first and only innovations in the veterinary market. This has been our strategic plan executed over several years, not only in the U.S., but in markets around the world. It's very simple. The more IDEXX representatives as subject matter experts in our category visit customers, the faster our customers grow their adoption and use of IDEXX's unique and innovative solutions.","So, let's look at a few numbers. In Q1 of 2016 in the U.S., we made nearly 63,000 field visits to veterinary practices, up 31% year-over-year. 23% of this growth came from productivity in the form of more visits per field representative, and the remainder was a consequence of more feet on the street year-over-year.","This visit rate is higher than I quoted in Q4 2015 and it includes not only our 180-plus veterinary diagnostic consultants, but also other types of Companion Animal Group diagnostic rules in our field organization, namely our highly-experienced professional service veterinarians and their wonderful team of field support representatives.","As there are roughly 25,000 veterinary practice locations in the U.S., 63,000 visits is an average of more than 2.5 visits per practice in a quarter or 10 per year. And this number does not include a variety of other ways we interact with customers, including trade shows, group educational dinners, online education, phone sales and support, corporate account interactions and sales roles in information management and digital radiography that are part of the field team activities.","We are finding that when we show up regularly at the practice quarter-after-quarter, the cumulative effect is a continuing strengthening of relationships with customers and prospective customers alike. Veterinarians are more and more seeing a unique company that is truly committed to bringing an impressive set of first and only diagnostic and software solutions that advance their practice.","Internationally, we are also seeing the benefits of enhanced commercial capability that we have built over the past few years. In all markets outside the U.S., the level of pet care, and the adoption of diagnostic technologies is far earlier in the curve than the U.S., even though people love their pets just as much.","Our Companion Animal Group recurring diagnostic revenues grew 13% organically over Q1 of 2015 outside the U.S., supported by our ever-increasing level of Catalyst One placements.","In addition, strong recurring gains in major developed economies in markets such as Europe, we are also seeing exceptional growth in the companion animal revenues in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, demonstrating the substantial long-term growth potential we see in our markets globally.","A reason for our optimism on our long-term growth potential flows from the strength of our innovative pipeline, which is expanding the market for diagnostics globally. So, let's do a couple of updates here on these newest technologies.","In Q1, we generated over 250 orders for SediVue, our first and only urine sediment analyzer. We have begun shipping SediVue to fulfill this backlog in April and the early customer response has been simply off the charts. So that means that while the field was busy generating customer orders, our Q1 results do not yet recognize the benefit of revenues from SediVue.","If you consider U.S. order generation rate for all premium instruments in Q1, adding catalysts or two hematology platforms and SediVue together, our sales team achieved 36% growth over Q1 of 2015. We see a high level of excitement about SediVue in our commercial organization and customers alike, as the new instrument addresses a critical pain point in the practice, while increasing the quality and consistency of urinalysis results.","We continue to educate the market on the remarkable value that SDMA brings in diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease, a common condition in pets likened to heart disease in humans. The veterinary nephrology committee is fully bought into the unique medical and clinical value of SDMA. And the International Renal Interest Society has incorporated SDMA as a key parameter in their diagnosis, staging and treatment protocols.","As investors know, SDMA is automatically included in every chemistry panel that is sent to IDEXX Reference Labs. Interestingly, our chemistry panel unit volumes and revenues in the U.S. are now growing faster than the Reference Lab overall, an acceleration that coincides with the SDMA launch last summer. This is likely because the number of veterinary practices sending us chemistry panels in the latest month is up 15% over March of 2015, when we had yet to launch SDMA. SDMA is now essentially fully launched on our global Reference Lab network. And to date, we have run 3.5 million SDMA tests for vets and pet owners globally.","Finally, kudos to our Water team. We haven't taken the opportunity lately to talk about our Water business. This is a terrific business for IDEXX, and part of our core portfolio of businesses with attractive recurring revenues. Our Water team delivered 11% organic growth in the first quarter, a continuation of its strong 7% to 8% organic revenue growth over the prior two years. This global business delivered a 41% operating margin in Q1, requiring only nominal invested capital. Our Water Testing business addresses a market that appears to be able to sustain high-single-digit organic revenue growth and sustained operating margins for years to come.","Overall, we believe that we are well positioned for sustained organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the company all together over the next several years, building on our accomplishments over the last several years and serving our core markets of animal health and water diagnostics, markets that are exhibiting underlying long-term, secular growth globally.","With these introductory comments, I'll now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning. Jon, maybe I'll start with one for you. Just in regards to the data you provided on the significant increase in the visit rate on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a little bit more color on what the vet participants that you're talking to are most interested in? Is it some of the new technologies? Is it kind of going back and learning about the entire IDEXX portfolio? Is it \u2013 just anything in particular that you're noticing in the numbers that might be sparked by those increased visits.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, I think they're most interested in the fact that we keep showing up, and we're there. The consistency of our presence is being noted by veterinarians. We're not like showing up and then not showing up for a long period of time. We keep coming back. And this is true with our customers that are using all of our diagnostic modalities. We're supporting them with \u2013 helping them to grow their practice, but it's also true with customers that may be using very little of IDEXX, but we keep showing up with ideas. They are very interested in our point-of-care solutions, real-time care, our reference lab modalities, our advances. I mean, SDMA is a big topic. Obviously, SediVue is a big topic.","But generally what we're finding is, well, initially, as we get through to a decision maker, it may be something new that captures their initial attention. But then, it really opens up the door for how IDEXX is really profoundly different in terms of integrated solutions, in terms of VetConnect PLUS, in terms of the real fundamental technological innovation we're bringing to the Reference Lab venue. So we may start with SDMA, but then we move on to fecal antigen or molecular diagnostics or several of our other areas of specialized tests that, quite frankly, they just hadn't fully appreciated that we have. And they're seeing that we really are bringing innovation to the market, which really differentiates us and kind of unique.","So I think the consistency of the presence is capturing the attention, and then the new innovations are drawing those relationships closer.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful color. And then maybe a follow-up. As you move more of your IT platforms into the cloud, and I know you already have links directly to the equipment and what's being used, can you talk a little bit about your future thoughts on things like vendor managed inventory where customers really don't even have to think about consumable re-orders so that even more of the time spent in the office can be discussing innovations or things like cost accounting to show the true value in something like SediVue? Thanks.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Ryan, I do believe that's a big deal. Obviously, you've been ahead of the Internet of Everything innovation that's going on in industries around the world with cloud-based technology. And the vast majority, for example, of U.S. Catalyst and premium hematology are connected to IDEXX with SmartService. And so we're now beginning to see, with the example of the introduction of SediVue, one of the exciting responses we're getting from the customers is that they don't have to buy inventory. They only pay or run when they actually do the run. And here's just an interesting thing, as I said, we started to \u2013 we probably now have installed a couple of dozen SediVue analyzers as part of the backlog, that doesn't include the couple of dozen analyzers that we had as part of the beta field trial. But these are new customers who are paying customers for six months with (27:19) SediVue as part of the launch. As we do the initial installation, our field reps \u2013 our service reps do a lot of training. And historically, customers are very nervous about using the consumables. But with SediVue, we only charge during the run and we don't charge them for any of the runs on the first day.","And so we get every single person in the practice to run the analyzer because they aren't worried about using up their inventory or paying for consumables. This idea that they don't have to manage their inventory and we're just going to ship them supplies like the Reference Lab model, we're going to ship them supplies on a demand generation basis based on their usage is very, very well appreciated by the customer and really I think the beginning of a new wave of innovation that we can bring to the market. And we'll learn a lot with SediVue over the course of this year on things that we can do in future years, on things like auto ship and vendor managed inventory.","Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Congrats on the strong start to the year.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is sort of a follow-up to the first part of Ryan's question. I guess, can you speak to the one-lab approach and the competitive advantages of that offer and then what you can offer now from a bundling standpoint or promotional standpoint? Has that promotional activity changed in response to this one-lab effort and the direct approach? Are you really starting to take advantage of what you can do there with the direct strategy as it matures?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you. Obviously, first of all, the one-lab approach starts with one diagnostic consultant that's showing up regularly at the practice and can support a customer by growing their practice through adopting \u2013 what's interesting is that we have advanced menu on both our in-house analyzers and in the reference labs that isn't fully utilized by our customers. So we go in there and we have a discussion about how they can advance their diagnostics regardless of modality. So let's just start with the relationship is one which is agnostic to whether they want to run it in house or reference lab, and that really \u2013 customers appreciate that and they take their guard down because they know we're not coming with a point of view. And of course, what I didn't mention in my opening comments is we've continued to see the growth in VetConnect PLUS utilization, not only for results, by the way, and not only for results, but results with images. And now, of course, with SediVue, we're going to have in-house urinalysis images as part of the VetConnect PLUS, but now for ordering and status and alerts, the whole online ecosystem which is integrated between in-house and reference labs. So the so-called bundling isn't just a marketing program. It's an overall approach to the way they're utilizing diagnostics in their practice that just makes it easier to run, utilize and interpret and see the results of their diagnostics because it's fully integrated between reference labs and in-house.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then the strong growth in the domestic lab business, that was a pretty significant step up. What's driving that? Is it market share gains, pricing, volume, the new testing capabilities such as SDMA or is it just seemingly a fundamental kind of demand trend that's driving that?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're very pleased with the high-teens growth in the U.S. Reference Lab business, volume-led growth. And I think the simple answer is it's all of the above. I noted the increasing number of customers who are sending us chemistry panels because they want the SDMA result. It's either because it's part of their core protocol or maybe they have a pet where they want to send us the panel. But this is true also with our fecal antigen is growing same-store sales. Obviously, I think you're seeing from the phenomenal metrics that Brian quoted, the 6% visit growth year-over-year and the 9%, it was a very strong quarter in terms of the overall business dynamics. Those numbers, by the way, are normalized for days including leap year.","And so, obviously, it was a very strong market in general and I think that was supporting our Reference Labs. So there are a lot of contributing factors. We're certainly pleased with the results, and we're pleased with the fundamentals in the Reference Lab business that \u2013 well, the first quarter I think was an exceptional quarter because of some unique aspects of the quarter.","I think we're pleased with the fundamentals of growth in the reference lab modality. And I will mention it's the largest of the three recurring revenue, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue modalities at IDEXX. So it's nice to see that one doing so well.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Quickly, did you break out that percentage of SDMA that's sent out on a one-off basis? And is there any change to the pricing there?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, there is a \u2013 with regard to SDMA and one-off basis, what we're really seeing is that when a customer who may not be using us as a primary lab or maybe they're splitting their lab volume among more than one lab, they're not sending us the SDMA only sample, they're sending us the whole chemistry panel because it just makes sense to do so. Why would they split \u2013 go to the trouble actually of splitting the sample? It's just easier just to send us the whole sample. And economically, it's more attractive to do so because the cost of sample, the total chemistry panel includes SDMA at no incremental charge.","Where we're really seeing the one-off SDMA are customers who are our loyal customers for both in-house and reference labs, and they might have been running the SDMA on the \u2013 I mean, they might have been running the chemistry panel on the in-house Catalyst and they want to augment that with an SDMA at the Reference Lab. And for that, we charge a nominal shipping charge, but we don't \u2013 we want to encourage people to continue to run real-time care if that's the modality they're most comfortable with.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe two from me. First one, Jon, back to what you mentioned on the sales and marketing, is that in business per year \u2013 is that the right number? Does it need to go higher as the company's innovation increases, meaning the need for more reps? Or now that you're almost 18 months into the go-direct experience, just your conviction level that you have the right number of reps and OpEx leverage may start to ramp a bit going forward?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you for that question. I would have approached that from a couple of dimensions. Fundamentally, from a financial model, we do see operating expense leverage in the North American commercial market. Now, with kind of growths that we're seeing, we can have operating expense leverage and we can add a few more feet on the street along the way. So those two are not inconsistent with each other because of the strong growth rates that we're seeing, and certainly that would be our intent. But it's really kind of backing and filling little places that we haven't quite gotten to the optimal level. We believe that the roughly 180-plus veterinary diagnostic consultants within a couple percent is the right set to fully cover the market.","But the other thing that I want to mention is, I mentioned the 23% year-over-year growth in visits on a same-rep basis for the veterinary diagnostic consultants. While we've seen tremendous productivity advances already that we've booked and those will have a cumulative effect, as I said, quarter after quarter. We're not anywhere near gaining the full productivity of this new organization. We've got some work to do over the next couple of years. We're going to be putting in Salesforce.com as a more advanced \u2013 we've done a lot in terms of sales force automation, but that's going to be a productivity driver. We're continuing to refine our calling patterns, so we're going to see greater presence in the market per rep. And so these productivity drivers, I think, as you've seen, they're going to be probably the number one contributor to the impact of our field organization, and that's going to translate into operating expense leverage.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Very helpful. And one more, Jon and Brian, actually, some interesting comments on the promotion dollars. I believe I heard you correctly, decreasing sort of helping to aid results. So again, Jon, your thoughts on sustainable going forward is the belief that as long as the company's innovation is there you can sort of keep those promotion dollars under wraps because of the differentiation. And then, Brian, just one sort of from an accounting perspective, are there fewer promotions? Is that less dollars netted against revenues? I think that's correct or is it an OpEx expense? Thanks, guys.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","We obviously have a number of different ways that we go to market with our customers, but we've gotten a lot of questions on the net customer acquisition costs. And you can see that in our balance sheet actually and in our disclosures in terms of the short and long-term customer acquisition costs net. And the key thing to look at there is, as we add business, we add customer acquisition costs. So growth is a good thing. We did see accelerated growth last year, and that has moderated significantly in Q4 and Q1. So that's kind of key point one, which is this normalization of the competitive environment that we've seen and we just wanted to highlight that. Those costs do get amortized over time in terms of the long-term business commitments that we have. So the degree that we have, basically less money going against kind of defending customer retention, that will improve our net price realization over time.","So our current results, really, where we had actually modest net price increases even with some of these carryover impacts, as we move forward, assuming kind of a continued normalization in the competitive environment, that could be a tailwind for us on the pricing front.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I would just add, I think, it's because we do see increasing loyalty with our customers across the modalities. And so what we're seeing here is two nice trends that are not inconsistent with each other. Moderation in the growth of the customer acquisition costs, but no moderation in the growth of customer acquisitions.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, can you provide us an update on when you initially started putting the SediVue in the hands of the initial users? And I think your guidance assumes 1,000 units. Can you just give us some context as to how you think that will track as we look out for the balance of the year?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we had really \u2013 I talked about two things. We had a couple of dozen units in the field that were non-revenue units in the first quarter that is part of our beta trial. It's part of our normal, refined instrument development and bringing it to market. We've gotten really good at bringing instruments to market, and one of those is to make sure we put the analyzer in the customer's hands in a beta to fully integrate all the learnings when the customers start using it because they do things we would never imagine they would do when we're looking at it in our test labs. What customers do with instruments in a veterinary environment, or maybe it's not just customers, but their pets, do to instruments surprises us. By the time we started shipping revenue units in April, we already had very good experience of how the unit would perform in the field from those beta trials.","And so then, simultaneous to that, of course, we generated a revenue order backlog, as I said in Q1, and we started shipping revenue units against that, and we have a couple dozen in as part of a controlled launch process. We're always checking with customer feedback along the way to make sure we captured those learnings before we ramp the volume. The initial customer feedback has been extraordinarily positive. We're very pleased with where we were on the instrument launch. We are very excited \u2013 SediVue is going to be a major new modality. The value of a SediVue placement is closer to a value of a competitive catalyst than it is to a competitive hematology. And so, we're very \u2013 we feel very good about our outlook for the year, and that is incorporated in all the puts and takes in our revised organic growth guidance.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. And so you raised 2016 revenue guidance by $40 million; $27 million is FX related. So as we're looking at our model, how would you suggest we allocate the incremental $13 million beat? Is it broad-based or is there a particular bucket we should be focusing on?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Q1 was clearly a key part of that, right? We had signaled in the 8% to 9% growth rate and we achieved 11% So, that's flowing through the Q1 benefit. And the balance is really kind of through the year. I think we gave you some specific numbers, Mark, for Q2. And I think we're feeling good about the SediVue trends. So, over time, we think that can flow through, but I think a meaningful part of that is the Q1 beat.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, there are a lot of \u2013 I just want to remind you there are a lot of moving parts at IDEXX. Obviously, we had a lot of focus on parts of our business and not as much focus on other parts. We're an international company. We're in a lot of markets. Let's just take \u2013 the Water business had a phenomenal, knocking out of the park in the first quarter of 11%. That is not likely a sustainable number. We believe that's a high-single-digit growth business, and so all that's corporated [sic] in the annual guidance.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last one. You commented that the rapid test declined 1% organically in the quarter. How should we handicap the possibility that you return to a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook in 2016, and what are some of the challenges you're seeing in the field as you go out and compete against other providers?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say I think that's \u2013 by the way, our rapid assay performance is as we expected, and I think we indicated that we felt it would be flat in the first quarter. And that's because the compares are toughest in the first quarter versus the balance of the year. We don't give guidance by modality by region, but we don't really see any change in the fundamental trends that we've seen over the back half of the last year terms of the strength of the 4Dx franchise and the trends in our first generation SNAP products. All those trends are continuing as we expected.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and great quarter. You're seeing good traction abroad. Can you talk about the expected utilization internationally compared to the U.S.?","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you for the question. I think you're probably referring to the instrument and consumable utilization there.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Exactly, the catalyst utilization. I mean the catalyst placement numbers abroad have been really good for the last few quarters.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And we're really seeing really nice consumable growth that's coming out of that augmented rate of placements. And so, the accounts outside the U.S. are smaller than the U.S. generally speaking. So the utilization per account is lower and we were \u2013 there's still a very significant installed base of tests that we're upgrading, although we continue to \u2013 none of those numbers included VetTest placements. We continue to place VetTest in some markets too, expanding our overall chemistry base, which is now over 40,000 active customers globally. But the rate of placements is really quite good in what are, generally speaking, have and always been smaller accounts.","I think Catalyst One is just a phenomenal instrument because of all the things that brings complete menu, unique menu with things like T4 integrated, ease of use using whole blood with no issues, the footprint, the integration, the VetConnect PLUS, these are all unique aspects of Catalyst One that make it very attractive for these smaller practices outside the U.S. Let alone practices in the U.S. where, if they need the capacity, it's very economical to add another Catalyst One to the same IDEXX VetLab station.","So, it's a very flexible analyzer that works in big practices and the types of practices that we see internationally. Combined with a phenomenal and experienced commercial organization, we have very experienced set of country mangers. Many of our \u2013 some of our country mangers have been in that roles over a decade. They've grown with IDEXX. They know their markets inside-out. We are fully direct in most developed countries now. It's been a systematic process that we've been putting in place over the last several years and I think we're seeing the benefits of that.","And then when you talk about utilization, the thing is that \u2013 things like preventative care are just things that are actually doing a full panel on a sick pet, it's surprising how little that has done today. And so, part of what we're doing is we're growing the market. We're expanding the market through education and providing them the tools with things like Catalyst One and reference lab to be able to do that. So, a lot of this is market development. I really don't see any end in sight in the opportunity to develop the market in these \u2013 in what some people refer to as mature, developed continents (46:54). Well, they're not matured and developed to us, let alone the kind of growth we're seeing in markets like Brazil and China.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, you and your competitor are just seeing massive growth rate in reference lab. I believe you quoted high-teens in the U.S. Your competitor quoted 9. Can you talk about what's driving that in North America specifically? Are you seeing some cannibalization of inside lab or is this just an overall, just incredibly healthy market that's doing a lot more diagnostic testing?","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, it's a very attractive market, and I think you can see that from our visit data and same-store sales practice data that Brian quoted of 9.2% in the first quarter and that was a very, very strong underlying market that we're seeing. We don't really speak to what we're seeing.","But the other thing we're seeing is volume growth in existing customers, that's not just things like existing panels, but adoption of our advanced menu, things like fecal or molecular diagnostics or some of our other specialty test categories.","So, what we're seeing is a growing utilization of things that only the reference lab can provide, but we're still seeing strong growth in the in-house modality, so, in chemistry in-house. And so, I think testing begets testing. I don't think there's any kind of fundamental shift happening between one and the other. They just have their own growth dynamics.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. And congratulations on a good quarter.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Just wanted to get a better sense of constant currency gross margins. Obviously, hedging gains and FX is playing a role there but gross margins were a little bit below our estimate. I'm just trying to get a better sense of how underlying trends are performing. I know you had a strong instrument quarter, so that might play a role. But just wanted to get more thoughts on constant currency gross margins.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I mentioned that the constant currency change year-on-year was 70 basis points down. So, taking out the currency hedge gain impacts, and it was really two dynamics. It was the \u2013 part of this was the \u2013 compared to \u2013 we had some favorable capitalized variances last year in terms of particularly in our LPD business that just had a high volume rate that flowed into lower product costs but you can see that in our reporting last year that we highlighted and that was a key part of it. The other piece of this is the instrument revenues and the instrument mix.","Let's say that our comparable margins in our business are quite good. We're improving gross margins and labs. Our margins in our core instrument businesses and things like that are doing quite well. So, net-net, we think we're right on track relative to where our gross margin goals. We knew we had some of the compare issues on to FX heading into the year, but we're reinforcing the operating margin outlook, which was \u2013 effectively where (50:15) sustained gross margins this year constant currency and some OpEx leverage, and we're right on track for that.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I also, Nick, want to reinforce that we see the opportunity over time over the next several years for gross margin expansion driven by our reference lab business around the world as well as the instrument and consumable business and also, again, it's smaller group, it's a smaller business, our information management business as we shift to the cloud. So, these are all long-term trends, we think, that will support our overall margin expansion strategy.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, you think about the organic growth guidance for the full year, obviously off to a very strong start. Is there anything that you're seeing in the marketplace that would suggest to you that the end market could potentially decelerate because it's clear to me that you have momentum across a variety of modalities. You have a burgeoning sales force that's successfully undertaking this transition. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why you would think that potentially growth would decelerate off of the strong 1Q levels? Thanks.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, there are a couple of factors in Q1 that we did highlight. I think the extra day was about a point, and it's tough to parse weather, but clearly, we had some favorable U.S. weather compares. And so, let's say that was about 1 point. It's again hard to estimate. But that's kind of in line with what we said we were going to do this year, net of those effects, and we feel very good about the trends in the business and we've obviously raised our guidance reflecting that. And so, we're not projecting a \u2013 it's not reflective of an expected deceleration in the business. It's more reflecting some \u2013 a couple of the unique factors to Q1.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think Brian did appropriate call out of some special factors in Q1 which is embedded in our guidance. Certainly, we don't see a deceleration. Our crystal ball isn't any better than anybody else's with regard to the general economy. But what I will say is that what happens is, overtime, as consumer confidence remains okay, maybe not fabulous, but okay, then they add pets to their household and then they need to take care of them.","I think the fundamental underlying environment that we've been in, that's built up over the last couple of years of consumers feeling okay or reasonably confident or having moved further away from the financial crisis, it really means that it's \u2013 that the trends in pet healthcare growth are pretty solid. And it takes a lot to change those trends because people love their pets and they're going to make sure that their pets are taken care of even if they get pressed in other areas of their wallet.","Now, they may not always replace their pet if they face a great recession like they did in 2019 (sic) [2009] (53:32) and that moderated the growth for a couple of years, 2010-2011, but now we've kind of come back out of that. And I think we've seen it was just generally a very, very good market. And, of course, the level of care that can be provided now by veterinarians is ever expanding. And so, we are blessed by serving an importing growing secular growth market.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's it for me. Nicely done, guys.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you.","Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I just want to thank everybody for signing on the call. We are just wanted my huge congratulations to the work that's been done by IDEXX around the globe across all the functions. We've done a lot of work to reposition the company over the last couple of years, and I think we're now in a place where we can perfect our new model. We're not making any big model changes like we've had in the past. And it's very, very gratifying that we could see the results of the hard work, including innovation and customer contact and the supporting organizations. So, I just want to really thank our organization for that and we recognize that we're here to create shareholder value and that's part of our job, part of our model, part of our purpose.
