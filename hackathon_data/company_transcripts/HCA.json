Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I, would like to welcome you on today's call, including those of you listening to our webcast. With me here this morning as usual is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. Several other members of the HCA senior management team are here with us as well to assist during the Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.","Richard M. Bracken","Thanks, Vic. Good morning to all and thanks for joining us on our call this morning. I'd like to start today by providing a few general thoughts on our fourth quarter performance as well as some observations for the entire year. And then following this, I have a few comments that I'd like to make about our ongoing work to analyze the potential effects of the health care reform legislation.","So for the fourth quarter. Generally, we were pleased with our overall performance for the quarter. For the most part and from an operations perspective, the trends we have been reporting in prior quarters in the year continued to play out in the fourth quarter. Favorable growth in patient volumes driven by market growth, as well as continued improvement in market share performance and favorable expense management helped to offset continued pressures in growth of per unit revenues. Our favorable volume performance has allowed us to operate more efficiently by spreading our fixed costs over a larger base and accordingly, helped overcome some of the revenue pressures.","As is our standard practice, in just a moment, Milton and Sam will provide detail in all of this, but my general takeaway for the quarter and really for the year is that our positions in our key markets remain strong. Our markets are growing, our operating agendas are structured appropriately, they are focused and they are effective. And the public and the communities we serve increasingly choose our delivery networks for their health care needs. We are working hard to earn their choice by providing convenient access to our facilities, a comprehensive scope of services and technologies, a high level of service and quality clinical care. Regardless of how the health care delivery in America evolves, we believe these are key ingredients for success.","Same facility equivalent admissions grew 5% in the fourth quarter, making 21 straight quarters or over 5 years straight of volume gains. This year's early and difficult flu season did impact our fourth quarter inpatient and emergency room volumes. However, growth in both these indicators were strong even when normalized for flu-associated volumes. Same facility emergency room visits in the fourth quarter were robust, increasing 12.7% over the prior year and increased 8.6% for the entire year. Throughout all of 2012, revenues increased to $33 billion, an 11.2% growth over the prior year; and adjusted EBITDA rose to $6.531 billion, a 7.8% increase over prior year. EBITDA, as previously reported, reflects the consolidation of our HealthONE venture for the full year, HITECH income and net Medicare settlements in the first quarter of 2012.","Cash flow from operations in 2012 remains strong, totaling $4.175 billion compared to $3.933 billion last year. And as we have previously stated, our rank priority for use of cash is, first, to invest in our existing markets in 2012. We invested $1.862 billion in CapEx, comprising approximately $1.62 billion on facilities and equipment, which accommodated the development of 400 new beds and $238 million on information technology. Secondly, focus on strategic acquisitions that can provide long-term growth for the company. And following these first 2 priorities, we consider a wide range of strategic options that can improve value to our shareholders, including debt repayment, share repurchase or the distribution of special dividends, which as you know, we did on 3 occasions during 2012.","As you will recall, in October of 2011, we purchased our partner's remaining ownership position in our HealthONE venture. Given the size of this transaction, we thought it might be helpful to share some perspective on the performance following this transaction. Our Denver market continued to perform favorably even exceeding our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2%, revenues increased 7.5% and equivalent admissions grew 5.7% over 2011 results.","Now before concluding my prepared comments this morning, I want to provide some general observations we have formulated concerning our analysis of the impacts of health care reform. Our most fundamental observation is while certain areas within the health care reform agenda are settled, many, and I stress, many uncertainties remain. These uncertainties make accurate modeling at this time very challenging. Nevertheless, we, like many of you, are in the process of trying to more fully understand the impact of this legislation and size the longer-term effects that it might have.","Over the past months, Milton has been leading an effort within our organization, along with multiple outside resources, to develop working assumptions that begin to quantify the range of potential impacts of the Affordable Care Act on our company. Let me emphasize that this is preliminary work and is expected to change as details that shape these assumptions continue to mature. Having said all of this, we continue to develop and access our data and intelligence that is helping us to improve our analysis. Our goal is to reach a point, perhaps in the mid to latter part of this year, when we feel comfortable sharing some of our assessments of key assumptions and begin to size the potential impacts of reform.","One belief that we do have is that reform is not all about 2014. We see it as being incremental, varied by market and evolving over a period of years. Consider the following. It's possible that the ramp-up of newly insured enrollees and the exchanges may take 3 to 4 years to reach a steady-state level. These states in our portfolio have not determined yet whether they will expand Medicaid coverage or when they might do so.","The degree of employer opt out into the exchanges, which we believe in part will be influenced by employer size, still is to be determined. And reimbursement rates to providers for exchange products, the utilization patterns of the newly insured and the effects of local market dynamics, to name just a few open issues, still need time to prove out. As time progresses, we should continue to get more clarity around many of these areas, allowing us to refine our model and expectations.","I should probably add that while we all know the amount of the annual market basket reductions that were included in the Affordable Care Act to fund coverage expansion, the computation of the Medicare disproportionate share, or DSH, reallocation which is scheduled to begin this October 1, is more difficult to quantify at this time. Milton will discuss our current thinking on DSH allocation in just a minute.","So as we reflect upon all of this, we believe we are well positioned to perform in the reform environment. And let me close by sharing with you that HCA's performance on the CMS core measures of clinical quality is now at 99.1% as compared with the national average of 97.4% based on their most recent release. We extend our appreciation to our management and clinical teams at these facilities for this performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. I hope most of you had a chance now to review our fourth quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some thoughts around the fourth quarter results, and then I'll close by addressing our 2013 guidance.","Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $8.434 billion, primarily reflecting consolidation of our HealthONE venture and increased patient volumes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.606 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year's $1.639 billion. HITECH incentive income declined in the fourth quarter of this year by $40 million to $80 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Volume trends in the quarter were strong, with same facility admissions increasing 4.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 5%, compared to strong volume comps from last year's fourth quarter of 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively. Our same facility medical admissions increased 6.1%, while same facility surgical admissions increased 0.7% compared to the prior year. Total admissions increased 6%, while equivalent admissions increased 7.1% compared to the prior year.","Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 17.5% on a same-facility basis and represent 27% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 6.1%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 8.3% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other admissions increased 1% in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly growth rate in 2012. Same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions increased 2% over the prior year's fourth quarter.","Uninsured admissions increased 11% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. The growth in uninsured admits accounted for approximately 80 basis points of the 4.3% same facility admission growth during the fourth quarter. Same facility uninsured admissions represents 7.6% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter.","Same facility emergency room visits were strong, increasing 12.7% in the quarter. On a consolidated basis, ER visits increased 14.1% during the quarter compared to the prior year.","Total same facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 0.9% in our same facility inpatient surgeries and 1.8% in our same facility outpatient surgeries. During the quarter, we view our revenue growth rate at stable to slightly improving compared to recent trends. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.5% in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've recorded in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program, revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.8%. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.7%. Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid waiver program, increased 0.9%.","Managed Medicare and other increased 4.8% over the prior-year period, the highest quarterly growth rate yield on our managed care revenue in 2012. Same facility security care and uninsured discounts increased $184 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $716 million, an increase of $31 million in the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.691 billion, an increase of $153 million from the prior-year period.","We were pleased with our overall expense management in the quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense, excluding HITECH and Texas Medicaid waiver program expenses, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012, which is fairly consistent with third quarter expense trends.","Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% on a same-facility basis. Same facility productivity performance is measured by man hours per equivalent admission, improved 1.5% over the prior-year period, and same facility wage rate growth was 2.3% in the fourth quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $5 million or 2.2% from the previous year's fourth quarter.","Same facility supply costs per equivalent admission increased 3.6% from the prior-year period, reflecting increased surgical volumes and a reclassification at HealthTrust Purchasing Group that was implemented effective October 1, 2012, a reclassification related to nonequity member administrative fees previously accounted for as a reduction in supply expense being reclassified as HealthTrust Purchasing Group revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $41 million and contributes 310 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the fourth quarter. The reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Same facility other operating expense -- other operating cost per equivalent admission declined 3.7% from the prior-year period, primarily due to a $69 million decline in Texas Medicaid waiver program-related expenses.","We recognized $80 million in electronic health record incentive income in the fourth quarter compared to $120 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $19 million in EHR-related expense in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011. Substantially all of our hospitals have achieved the second year Stage 1 Meaningful Use and have certified as such during the fourth quarter.","Cash flow from operating activities totaled $1.263 billion in the quarter compared to $1.387 billion last year. The decline was primarily due to increased tax payments. Cash tax payments totaled $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to a net cash tax refund of $161 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Days and accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter were 51 days compared to 52 days for the same period last year. And at December 31, 2012, the company's debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 4.4x compared to 4.5x at December 31, 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.964 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","With that, now let me turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter and then provide an update on inpatient market share for the second quarter of 2012.","Volume growth across the company's 14 domestic divisions was very consistent again this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admissions, 9 divisions had growth in same facility managed care inpatient admissions. Same facility inpatient admissions, excluding pulmonary or flu-related admissions, were up 3.3%, which represents a strong rate of normalized growth for the quarter.","All 14 domestic divisions had growth in same facility adjusted admissions. 12 divisions had growth in same facility managed care adjusted admissions. The company has implemented specific plans to grow the commercial segment of our business, and we believe our plans are progressing well across most markets. All divisions had growth in same facility emergency room visits again this quarter, reflecting continued success with our many initiatives to gain share in this service line. Additionally, all divisions had growth in managed care emergency room visits, which were up 9.6%. And finally, EMS visits to our emergency rooms grew by 5.9%. All divisions had growth in this area also.","Same facility ER visits, excluding pulmonary or flu-related visits, were up 8.9% for the quarter. This adjusted rate is above our 2012 growth rate for prior quarters and like inpatient admissions, represents a strong rate of normalized growth.","Milton mentioned the improvement in our surgical volumes this quarter. On an inpatient basis, orthopedics, neurosurgery and oncology services showed the strongest growth. On an outpatient basis, orthopedics, women's and GI services were strong. Managed care outpatient surgery volumes this quarter were essentially flat, which is an improvement over recent trends.","Same facility admissions into our adult intensive care and neonatal intensive care units this quarter were up 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The growth in our neonatal volume is driven mostly by growth in obstetrics admissions, which grew 4.0% this quarter. Growth in managed care obstetrics admissions was comparable. And finally, on a same-facility basis, behavioral admissions grew 6.7% in the quarter, and rehab admissions grew 15.9%.","Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ending second quarter 2012. Again, this is the most current data available, and it represents almost 90% of the company's market. First, the company's overall market share during this period increased by 54 basis points to 23.3%. Second, we gained market share on a sequential basis when comparing the second quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2012. This follows sequential market share gains in each of the past 3 quarters as compared to the respective preceding quarter.","Market share for the second quarter was the highest it has been over the past 14 quarters. We gained market share in 13 out of 17 service lines that we monitor. HCA had market share gains in 28 of 37 markets, with strong growth in all major Texas markets, Denver, Miami, Jacksonville, Nashville, Richmond and Las Vegas. We had market share growth in both the commercial and in-migration segments of our business. And finally, overall market demand at HCA's markets for inpatient admissions in this period grew by 0.5%, which is a slight acceleration from the same period 12 months ago. If we use this growth rate as a proxy for inpatient demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2012, we believe HCA will show, when the data becomes available, further gains in market share during these periods also.","As we move into 2013, we believe the components of our organic growth plans, coupled with the continual leveraging of best practices across the company, position us well to drive comparable gains in market share. With that, I'll turn the call back to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","Thanks, Sam. Before discussing our guidance for 2013, I'd like to comment on our results for 2012 relative to the guidance we gave you last year. Recall that we last revised our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012.","We hit the high end of our revenue estimate of $33 billion and finished slightly above the midpoint of our range for adjusted EBITDA guidance. Although we were able to meet our guidance for adjusted EBITDA for the year, the underlying metrics were challenging. Our same facility revenue rate growth fell short of the 1.5% to 2% target with 0.3% growth. We were able to offset the revenue rate shortfall with volumes well above our expectations and better expense management than planned.","Now turning to our 2013 guidance. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate for 2013 consolidated revenues should range from $33.5 billion to $34.5 billion. This does not include the impact from acquisitions that may be completed in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate a range of $6.25 -- $6.25 billion to $6.5 billion for the year, while earnings per diluted share are estimated to range from $3 to $3.30 for 2013. We estimate equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for the year. With respect to net revenues per equivalent admissions, excluding the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program, we expect growth of 1% to 2% in 2013. We expect to continue to face reimbursement pressure from governmental payers during 2013.","Medicare revenues in our 2013 estimate reflect a composite declining rate of approximately 1.2%, and our estimate assumes the following: 2% payment reduction attributable to sequestration beginning in April; coding recruitment reductions, which were included in the year-end [indiscernible] legislation of approximately $25 million, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013. Although the rules related to  DSH redistribution will not be issued until April, our estimate assumes Medicare DSH reductions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 resulting from the Affordable Care Act planned for DSH redistribution. We remain hopeful that the final redistribution rule will result in a redistribution that more reasonably reflects the number of uninsured patients we treat at our facility.","Medicaid revenues reflect an estimated reduction of approximately $40 million related to the Texas Medicaid waiver program. Additionally, we expect rate reductions in Managed Medicaid in 2013.","Relative to operating expenses, we anticipate that we continue to benefit from a low inflationary environment in 2013 while continuing to invest in our clinical and EHR development initiatives. Our expense per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid waiver program expense, is estimated to increase by approximately 2.5% over the prior year.","Following our IPO in 2011, we adopted a new management equity program with annual grants generally vesting in an expense over a 4-year period. As a result, it will take a full 4 years for this noncash, share-based compensation expense to fully normalize in our adjusted EBITDA run rate. In 2012, the company recognized $56 million related to the program. Our 2013 guidance includes the second year of the program, with noncash, share-based compensation expense increasing to $128 million or a $72 million increase over 2012. The 2013 guidance includes estimated HITECH incentive income of $200 million to $225 million and HITECH-related expenses in the range of $110 million to $130 million.","As I mentioned on last quarter's call, our adjusted EBITDA growth for 2013 will be negatively impacted as compared to 2012 by the net favorable Medicare adjustment, both the rural floor and SSI ratio recorded in the first quarter of 2012 of $170 million, and approximately $115 million less HITECH incentive income in 2013. These 2 items have a 460-basis-point negative impact on 2013 adjusted EBITDA growth. When also considering the noncash, share-based compensation expense growth, the negative impact on 2013 adjusted EBITDA totals 580 basis points.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Milton, Richard, Sam, thank you. Candice, if you want to come back on and poll for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to A.J. Rice from UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe I'll go back to Richard's comment on the health reform. I think you highlighted 4 major variables: ramp-up in coverage, Medicaid expansion, rates on exchanges and employer dumping. Can you -- I know you guys aren't going to be ready to give specifics for a while, but I wondered if you could tell us, as you think about the variability around each of those, which one has the most -- which ones have the most swing factor to you? And if there's any sense on your part, when you might get visibility on those 4 items?","Richard M. Bracken","Okay. A.J., thank you. And as I look at those variables, they all look important to me. I would say that, though, if I had to pick something that I think is most important, it would clearly be reimbursement rates that we would negotiate exchange products at and really the sort of the utilization rates of the uninsured. And both of these things are going to -- that's why we are struggling to be definitive at this point in time. And what -- the way we look at the work we're doing now is there's a lot of variables out there. And some we're able to begin to size through work that's being done by focus groups and surveys and relative to the employer intentions or potential actions that publics might take in certain markets, and we begin to size pieces of it. But others that are going to be rate-based or utilization-based will take more time to actually come online. We certainly know what our commercial books are at. We've been pretty public about how we think about that. We're looking at each of these markets being independent. We don't have a strategy or a policy that's going to roll out over every market. So this is truly a model that's in development and that we're continuing to get pieces and facts around. And we'll let you know what we have, as we've said, in the middle to latter part of the year. And it'll be what it is at that point in time. There'll still be holes at that point in time. But as much as we've been able to figure out or put some detail around or to the degree in which what we are assuming things, we'll put that out as well.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, just maybe a follow-up on that, a comment around managed care. Can you just sort of update us again where you're at in contracting for 2013 and 2014? And does any of that have exchange-related contracting in it at this point?","R. Milton Johnson","A.J., this is Milton. Right now -- the answer to the second part of the question is no. We -- right now our contracts are structured basically consistent with where they've been over recent years. We've got virtually all of 2013 managed care revenue under contract and that's a contracted rate of 5% to 6%. We've got about half of the managed care revenues for 2014 under contract and similar rate increases and probably 35-or-so percent of '15. So again, as usual, a lot of visibility into our managed care contracting. But really at this point in time, no material exchange products have been negotiated.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to follow up on the DSH money. So you're basically saying it's $200 million annually, is that correct?","R. Milton Johnson","That's our estimate as of today. And hopefully, when the regs are issued in April, we can have a more favorable outcome. But based on what we know today, what we expect today, it would be an annual negative impact of about $200 million.","Victor L. Campbell","And Chris, this is Vic. We'll see proposed regs come out in April, and the industry will have a period of time to comment and then the final rule usually comes out in August.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And is the money -- what were the Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments in 2012?","R. Milton Johnson","Probably, I'd say, Medicaid and Medicare probably around $650 million or so, $650 million.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess a follow-up on the sort of managed care pricing. And when you think about the way HCA has set up cluster market strategies, local market strength, and you hear the managed care guys talking about they think narrow networks is sort of what you're going to see in 2014, do you view your sort of cluster strategy as being advantageous? Meaning, you're going to be a part of the narrow network, or that allows you to sort of hold the line on pricing and stay kind of status quo is what it is?","R. Milton Johnson","Well, first of all, in health care reform and what Richard was obviously commenting about, it's going to be a very market-by-market driven strategy. There's not going to be a overall HCA cookie-cutter approach. It will be market-by-market. And certainly, there are markets where we may find a restricted network or narrow network attractive. But again, it's going to be based upon market circumstances and taking into account the number of uninsured lives and the market share and the like.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could ask a follow-up question on the managed care contracting for the exchanges. If you don't have those rates locked down, do you default to the commercial rates? I just wanted to confirm that. And can you characterize the early pace of the negotiations in terms of what you think the expectations of the health plans are in those negotiations?","Victor L. Campbell","Matt, thank you. We have Juan Vallarino, who heads up our Managed Care Group. You want to address that one?","Juan Vallarino","Sure. Matt, the answer to the first question is our current contracts do not include exchange pricing, so it's a separate bucket. So commercial rates do not apply nor Medicaid rates do not apply. The second, discussions are really too early to go into any substantive rate discussion. Everything we're hearing right now is posturing on both sides. And I think over the next 45 days, you'll see it come to fruition and a lot of good plays out in network sizing, volume assumptions and the like.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And just if I could as a follow-up on a different topic. How do you interpret the stronger utilization trend that you're seeing? I mean, we've been waiting for utilization demand to firm up somewhat. Historically, there's a -- at least we've looked at and I know some of the actuaries have to pattern a multi-year lag for utilization demand to return after the beginning of an economic recovery. How are you looking at it at this stage?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. I'm going to ask Sam Hazen to address that. And also, I want to encourage folks, hold your questions to one because we got a bunch of people on the line. I'm going to hate to cut people off when we get there. All right. Go ahead, Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Well, I think as I've said on my comments, we have seen a slight acceleration in overall demand across HCA's markets. Again, I think that speaks to our portfolio, as we've said before, in that where we're located, which markets we serve, we have in general a better economic circumstance than other markets. So I think that's driving some piece of the demand that we're seeing inside of HCA. The second thing is the strategy of the company is yielding, I think, some results obviously as our market share continues to show improvement. But what we are seeing on the commercial side, it's somewhat encouraging. We've seen sequentially across the quarters a slowdown in overall commercial reductions to the point where the last few quarters have started to get closer to sort of a flat environment inside of HCA's market. And so that's, I think, a function of the lag that you mentioned previously about the economic rebound and how it affects overall demand on the commercial book of business. Obviously, on the Medicare side -- in the Medicaid side, utilization is not controlled to the same degree. It doesn't get the same kind of impact in our estimation as the commercial side does with respect to the economy, but we are seeing that. So as we build our 2013 assumptions, we did factor in those observations and built that into our top line assumptions.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joshua Raskin from Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess my one question just focused on Las Vegas market. I think you guys gave the update that, that was one of the markets that showed the improvement in market share. So I'm just curious, what do you think is driving that? And do you guys have any updated thoughts on potential contract negotiation with the biggest payer there?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen","Well, when we severed our relationship with Sierra, now United, many years ago, we had to reinvent ourselves in that market in order to be effective. And part of that strategy, I think, has served us well with our ability to operate our emergency rooms, our ability to focus on our physician relationships and creating opportunities for them to do business at HCA's facilities. And then we've been very effective in our outreach efforts in that market to compensate for the fact that we're dealing with a very small market when you consider our out-of-network position with Sierra. We've added service lines that have helped us there as well. And so from that standpoint, we've been very pleased with the overall trend lines as it relates to our admission activity and market share performance. We're obviously open to discussions. We have ongoing discussions with the folks in Las Vegas in United. We haven't yet reached any kind of relationship, but we're open to that as the opportunity presents itself, but it has to be at a rate that obviously makes sense for us. We continue to invest in this market. We are adding capacity at a couple of our facilities to accommodate the growth as well as some program development. And we're seeing a little bit of a turn in the economy, which is having a slight impact on our payer mix, not material, but better than it's been over the past few years. So we continue to plug along with the same basic elements of our strategy, and we're reasonably optimistic. It's important to understand Las Vegas only represents about 3% to 4% of the company's volume. It's a very small piece of our overall portfolio. But it is an important market to us, and we continue to focus our efforts appropriately.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Lake from JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is a follow-up on reform. I wanted to make sure I'm hearing you correctly. So you're expecting reform to be a multi-year impact, which makes sense. You don't get the full benefit in 2014 of coverage expansion and obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. But given the moving parts for 2014, do you still believe the net impact of reform is likely to be positive overall in the company? Or could the variables you laid out actually lead to a net headwind from reform in 2014?","R. Milton Johnson","Justin, yes, we're not going to give guidance on 2014 health care reform today. As Richard mentioned, we're still working through our views in the model and hopefully later this year, we will be able to give you that information, probably not only for one year but for a multiyear outlook for health care reform.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess my question is sort of on the acquisition environment. You mentioned strategic acquisition as sort of a second priority for cash. Can you tell us a little bit more about your thoughts there? Is it sort of supplementing within markets? Would you buy big systems in brand new markets? And behavioral and rehab have been really strong contributors on volumes. So are you thinking about ancillary areas like that as well in your acquisition strategy?","Victor L. Campbell","Richard, do you want that one?","Richard M. Bracken","I'll start off on the general acquisition sort of strategy. Of course, we do believe that the environment is certainly more -- there are more opportunities presenting themselves now than there were a couple of years ago, and we're certainly processing more potential opportunities for acquisition. Having said that, acquisitions come up when they come up. They can be choppy. It's a reaction from the marketplace. And we think the marketplace, as it gets more difficult over the future years, there will continue to be more acquisitions, and we will remain very interested in analyzing those. Our filters that we put through acquisitions through are many. I think you know historically, we have been very disciplined buyers. We think that's important going forward. We obviously like acquisitions of not only hospitals but all associated parts of our network strategies that support our markets. So we're open to different kinds of things in our key markets. Clearly, our strategy is to focus on where we have a base of operations rather than de novo market. And relative to de novo markets, we do consider them if we can establish what we feel would be a meaningful network strategy over a period of time and be a meaningful market share player. So I would say the de novo markets are probably lower down on our priority list, but the existing markets and all parts of the network strategy would be in our cross hairs.","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, you want to...","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes, let me just add to Richard's comments. Last year 2012, the company acquired 6 outpatient surgery centers inside of existing markets and obviously, the intent there is to complement our network of access and to develop our new physician relationships. In addition to that, we acquired a surgical hospital in another one of our markets, which expanded our capacity and expanded our reach in that community. And then finally, on the, I'll call it, the sub-accute, we have a letter of intent to acquire a rehab hospital in the market. So we're very focused on adding appropriately to our network through those add-on acquisitions. And that will continue to be our strategy in 2013 as those opportunities surface. In those markets where we think we have substantial market share and the inability to acquire or there's just not anything available in our opinion, we have a move towards adding capacity and adding new facilities. As I mentioned on the last call, we have 4 new hospitals that are under construction in major HCA markets that will -- 2 of them will come online this year in 2013 and 2 of them will come online in early 2014. We think these are long-term plays for the company but at the same time, they're very complementary to existing networks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just in terms of the reform assumptions, going back, just to clarify, later this year, should we expect kind of guidance in terms of EBITDA and EPS or just a kind of framework, I guess, first? And then just along those lines, can you talk about what you're doing now or plan to do in 2013 to prepare for 2014 in terms of kind of both operational as well as an outreach perspective? Like how much of a role can you all play in getting people signed up for exchanges and\/or processes in place to get them signed up for Medicaid?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, you want that?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, so Ralph, what we're anticipating and again, I'm going to keep some flexibility here as we continue to work through this project. But what we anticipate is getting the impact on the company from health care reform, both we see the upside and then how we see the cuts that we -- from on the Medicare program. So it would be kind of a with and without approach is what we're anticipating. It would not -- our outlook would not include anything about the base business in those out years. It would include the impact of health care reform on the base business with whatever market forces we're dealing with in those out years. And it would be presented most likely in a range of EBITDA impact is how we're thinking about it. Relative to what we're doing, I think what -- how we operate the business every day and how we've been operating our business for years will actually position us well in a health care reform environment. So I don't see major changes in how we run the company in a health care reform environment. Obviously, as I said earlier, market-by-market there will be new opportunities, and we will certainly implement strategies to maximize opportunities in those markets.","Operator","And we'll go next to Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to confirm, the numbers you gave on rehab and behavioral, were those same-store or were those total?","Victor L. Campbell","Those were same-store numbers.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got it. 2 questions, just hoping to get a quick update on the observation stay versus 1-day stay. Has that stabilized? Is it incrementally getting better or worse? And then finally, do we expect any ER volumes spill over into the first quarter that kind of strengthens going to fourth?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, the observation 1-day stay, that has stabilized, and that has not been an issue for us this year. So it remains stable, and the outlook for that is to remain stable.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then ER volumes?","R. Milton Johnson","Sam, I didn't hear what the question.","Samuel N. Hazen","He was thinking about ER volume into '13, early part of '13.","Victor L. Campbell","Yes, and I guess, Frank, I think we really don't comment on current quarter periods of time. So obviously, and by reading the press, there's lots of flu out there. But I think in terms of trying to discuss January or February, we don't want to do that on this call.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Since I think I've heard you say we're not going to talk about anything more on reform, I think I'm not going to ask you about reform. So let me ask you a different -- a completely different question then. One of the concerns that I have heard from investors in your stock today is the disconnect between the EBITDA and where consensus is generally in line with your guidance. And so we get the joke that you got 500 basis points plus of pressure but you're still producing EBITDA that's almost in line with what you reported this year. But the EPS seems to be out of whack. So can you help us to understand where we are wrong as a consensus estimate on the Street between the EBITDA and the net income per share line?","R. Milton Johnson","Sheryl, this is Milton. Let me try to walk you through that. So if you think about the range of EBITDA guidance, the $6.25 billion to $6.5 billion for 2013, if you walk down in our assumptions around depreciation, approximately $1.7 billion in depreciation expense, we would expect interest expense to be in the range of about $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion for the year. Tax rate, call it like 38.5%, 39% tax rate and about 467 million roughly shares. So I think if you walk down the EBITDA guidance range with those metrics, you will come up with the EPS range.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just a clarification here, when you talk about the tax rate, you're talking about the actual tax rate you apply to pretax less noncontrolling interest?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, you got -- yes, that's correct.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that -- it ends up looking lower than 38% when you do it that way?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, so you have to take net income before taxes, subtract the minor...","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Minority interest.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, minority interest, and then you'll see that tax rate be more in line with what you would expect.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And did you comment at all on cash flows, did I miss that?","R. Milton Johnson","I have not. We will be -- cash flow from operations for next year will probably be in the range of, call it, $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion -- or $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion sort of zone for next year. We will have, in our estimates, higher cash taxes. You will see, based upon the interest number I gave you, slightly higher interest paid in next year. And the CapEx target is going to be approximately $2 billion, which is up from the $1.862 billion this year. So we will see our cash flow from operations expectation is -- would be declined from this year's, I think, record number of $4.175 billion.","Operator","And we'll go next to Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify one thing on CapEx. Is there any way for you to break out for us what your IT expenditures are going to be, if that's the swing factor in terms of it growing? So that's a clarification. And then maybe just more of a philosophical question I have for you. We've seen a lot of different organizations respond to some of the CMMI initiatives and some of the payment models that CMMI has been putting out. I guess the question here is, what's HCA's approach to some of this? And do you plan on participating in any of these models? And I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about those opportunities.","Richard M. Bracken","I'll mention one thing on the CapEx, and then maybe, Juan, you can talk a little bit about the CMMI initiatives, or Sam, whoever wants to take that one on. Our CapEx for next year is, from a composition basis, is pretty much similar to what it was this year. We stepped it up a little bit in terms of what we term our routine spend. That's just the spend that goes to fundamental facilities, clinical equipment and the like. So we don't really see a major breakout in technology spending or any major changes in sort of the components of our CapEx allocation.","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes, let me start on the CMI projects that you were mentioning, Darren. The company clearly evaluates any opportunity and any new program that comes out, and we do it with our folks in the field. We evaluate our programs, our position in the marketplace, our position capability and so forth. And we went through the process on the most recent program that was discussed around bundled payments and so forth. And we chose, at this particular point in time, not to pursue participating in those initiatives. We felt there were other initiatives that made more sense for our organization at that particular point in time. We do have a number of tests and pilot programs with various payers across the marketplace, both with our physicians as well as our facilities to understand what impact they have and how we would think about them in other situations across the company. And so we're very connected to that process. It's just that when we don't have enough details or we don't have the necessary situation in place where it makes sense at the time, we make the decision as we do our evaluation. And that's pretty much how we handle this bundled project program that the government was pushing through the industry. And across HCA's markets, there's very few systems that actually participated, and I think it just reflects the other opportunities that exist within those markets.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to understand if there was anything that we should think about as far as investments that you guys are making to prepare for 2014? We hear a lot about it from the managed care side of things, but haven't really heard about it from the hospital side. Is there anything that you need to do as far as staffing up in front of that potential volume increase in 2014 or investments around contracting or narrow networks or thinking about risk, or anything along those lines that we should be thinking about as the year goes on?","Samuel N. Hazen","This is Sam again. I think Richard mentioned in his comments and Milton alluded to it as well, and I just mentioned that we do have a few pilot concepts that we're exploring that aren't necessarily applicable to reform per se. They're just the dynamics that exist within our markets, and we're responding to that. One thing we have done as we studied our capacity, I think, very carefully is to understand where do we have capacity constraints that we need to address, whether that's with access within a market, whether that's with beds or other capabilities within our facilities. But again, that's sort of normal business for HCA. I wouldn't say it's anything new because of reform. If we do see a spike in demand within our markets like some people assume as reform develops, then we'll have to continually adjust our capacity if our share continues to maintain itself. But that's still sort of normal course of operations for the company. We have a very disciplined approach to understanding our utilization of our facilities, our occupancy rates, our clinical technology needs and so forth, our physician needs. And as we work our way through the market dynamics, study the behaviors of the market, we will adjust as we've been adjusting to the dynamics up to this point. So I don't think you'll see anything dramatically different for the company as we move through the next 18 to 24 months.","Richard M. Bracken","You clearly wouldn't see any additions in variable staffing or anything. That will all be handled on a as-needed basis very close to the time of demand. So we wouldn't see any kind of sort of labor associated with that. The only sort of incidental labor that I would mention that -- and is not really related to reform, is, to Sam's point as to overall sort of market conditions, is our continued investment in our quality agenda, our quality performance teams, our ability to deploy the EHR and Meaningful Use and the like. And those areas we continue to invest labor to prepare ourselves for the future.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Wonder [ph] if you would answer this directly but, Milton, was just curious what the actual assumption is you're making for the uninsured declines in that $200 million cut from DSH. And do you have an idea actually when the CBO is going to publish their assumption for uninsured decline?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, Whit, so what we know, there was a call and a document that was issued by CMS is the basis for our estimates. And basically today, as you're probably aware, DSH is distributed or allocated based upon Medicaid and SSI recipient days. And the new formula would be going to what's uncompensated care. And right now the way that uncompensated care is being designed is, with my understanding, would be charity care and bad debts and then that's multiplied by the cost of charge ratio. Well, what that formula does, it penalizes efficient providers. And also, what it doesn't pick up would be uninsured discounts. And as you know from following the company over a number of years, we give significant uninsured discounts to our uninsured patients. And that's not picked up in the uncompensated care formula, at least not as we understand it today. So as a result, it's not based upon a volume metric, this 75% redistribution, but based upon uncompensated care and the way that's being defined, and then the fact that efficient providers with a lower cost of charge ratio, again, would be hurt in this redistribution and that's the -- the $200 million is the effect upon HCA.","Victor L. Campbell","Yes, and I guess I'd direct you to that call that Milton mentioned was a public call. It was on January 8, and I think there's some slides and information on the CMS website. So again, it's preliminary. We're still waiting for the actual proposed rule to come, but we had to put something in our numbers as we develop guidance for the year.","Richard M. Bracken","And Whit, your comment about the reduction in the uninsured, so as you just heard, this redistribution formula, the $200 million is not attributable to reduced uninsured patients in our facilities. It's attributable to a new formula. And going forward, as health care reform is implemented, the number of uninsured do decrease that pool that would decrease further over time.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I know -- I mean, it was my assumption that the CBO was just going to make an estimate, and that's what the entire industry had to base their calculation on. So I just wasn't sure if you had an idea when the CBO may actually disclose or publish that.","Victor L. Campbell","No, we really don't.","I tell you, with that, we want to thank everyone. We got done within the hour. So thank you very much. You all have a great day. Mark and I are here all day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Vic Campbell","All right. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today\u2019s call, including those of you who are listening to the webcast.","With me this morning, as usual, are Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; President and CFO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President of Operations; and then we have many other members of the management team that are here with us or on the call to assist during the Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they\u2019re based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company\u2019s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","As you\u2019ve heard, the call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.","Richard Bracken","Thank you, Vic. Good morning to all, and we do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Before I ask Milton and Sam to provide some operating details for the quarter, let me start by sharing a few brief and general observations.","We are pleased to report that overall the results of our first quarter were generally in line with our expectations and provided a solid start for the year. Generally, we saw a continuation of the trends that we\u2019ve been reporting on in recent quarters \u2013 favorable patient volumes, supported by efficient cost management, offsetting continued pressure on revenue per unit of service.","For the quarter, and as reported, adjusted EBITDA was $1.823 billion, an increase of 14.6%. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding the net positive prior-year Medicare adjustments we announced on April 12th, was $1.652 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to the prior year.","Now, please keep in mind that our as-reported numbers do include the full ownership and consolidation of our Denver HealthONE market, as completed last November, and our Miami Mercy Hospital acquisition completed last April.","Growth in patient volumes remained favorable for the quarter, even considering that all volume metrics were aided by the extra day in February due to Leap Year. Given this, reported admissions for the quarter were up 9%, and reported equivalent admissions increased 11.4%. On a same-facility basis, admissions and equivalent admissions grew 3.2% and 4.8, respectively. We now have experienced 18 quarters in a row of positive equivalent admissions growth.","In addition, we also continued our favorable trends in emergency visits growth. As reported the emergency department growth was 10.5% for the first quarter or a 5.3% rate on a same facility basis. We also experienced growth in surgical volumes of 10.6% on a reported basis and 2.3% on the same facility basis. And as I\u2019ve stated previously we believe our patients volume growth reflects not only strategic facility locations in areas with favorable growth dynamics, but also due to the success of our operating agenda that seek to improve accessibility of our services and the efficiency and effectiveness with which we service our patients through the system.","We remain committed to the strategies as a way to not only improve efficiency but to improve the patient experience and clinical outcomes as well. Market share performance for the quarter remained positive and you will hear from Sam about some observations we have on market growth characteristics as well as recent share gains. We believe these gains reflect traction around our emergency department strategies, rural outreach efforts, patient transfer centers, physician integration, and quality performance agendas.","On the pricing front, while Medicaid and Medicare pressures continued we saw some favorable results this quarter in our commercial book and Milton will provide some details on these metrics in just a minute. Once again, and as we have also reported recent quarters, our expense management has been effective. On a same facility basis our cost per equivalent admission for the past five quarters has been generally consistent. In essence we have managed volume adjusted cost inflation flat compared to prior year with three quarters. This reflects a very solid performance by our operating teams.","In addition to operating costs we\u2019ve also reduced our cost of debt capital, interest expense in the first quarter of 2012, is down $91 million compared to the same quarter of last year. And at quarter end our debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 4.43 times. Our quality performance initiatives continue with much success during the quarter, 9% of hospitals named to the Thomson Reuters 100 top hospitals for 2012 rates safe facilities, these results were based upon measures of clinical quality, efficiency and patient perception of care. These hospitals achieve lower 30-day readmission rates, shorter hospital stays and better survival rates, we are pleased with this recognition.","And as I turn the call over to Milton I do want to draw your attention to our increased guidance for 2012 as provided in this morning\u2019s earnings release. Our revised guidance reflects the net effect of the two Medicare adjustments as identified in the first quarter results. So with that let me turn this over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","Right. Thank you, Richard and good morning to all. I trust most of you have had a chance to review the company\u2019s first quarter earnings release issued this morning. Our reported numbers require some explanation to understand the underlying trends and I will attempt to provide more clarity and be happy to take questions afterwards. Just to remind everyone HealthONE is not included in our same facility stats for the quarter. As Richard mentioned, the first quarter results once again provided for strong same facility volume growth and excellent same facility expense management. Same facility total case mix declined 0.5% in the prior year\u2019s first quarter, which was generally consistent with the third and fourth quarter of 2011 which declined 0.5 and 0.4 from the prior year\u2019s third and fourth-quarter respectively.","Revenues in the first quarter increased 13.5% to 8.405 billion, primarily driven by the financial consolidation of our HealthONE venture, increased patient volumes, and the net effect of the two Medicare adjustments that we disclosed in our prerelease of April 12th. Same-facility revenue increased 5.1% in the first quarter compared to the prior year, and excluding the Medicare adjustments, it grew 2.7%.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. in the first quarter totaled $540 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to $240 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. Results for the first quarter of 2012 include the two previously announced Medicare adjustments, which had the net effect of increases of $188 million to revenues, $170 million to adjusted EBITDA, and $0.22 to earnings per diluted share.","The Rural Floor Settlement will have no impact on future results, while the SSI ratio recalculation is estimated to reduce Medicare revenues by approximately $1 million per month in future periods.","Results for the first quarter of 2011 include a charge of $181 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the termination of the private sponsors management agreement, which was terminated pursuant to its terms upon completion of the company\u2019s IPO in March of 2011.","During the first quarter, same-facility admissions increased 3.2%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 4.8%. Patient volume growth was primarily driven by medical admissions, which increased 4.5%, while surgical admissions increased 1.1% on a same-facility basis.","Total admissions increased to 9% and equivalent admissions increased 11.4% during the quarter, primarily reflecting the HealthONE consolidation. Sam will provide additional insights into our volume growth in his comments.","Volume growth from governmental payors continued to outpace growth from commercial payors. Same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.8% and 5.4%, respectively, in the quarter. Same-facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 12.1% on a same-facility basis and now represents 25.4% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same-facility Medicaid admissions increased 4.1%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 4.7% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility managed care and other admissions were flat with prior year, while same-facility managed care equivalent admissions increased 2.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period.","This is the third consecutive quarter that we have seen equivalent admission growth in our managed care book and the highest rate of growth in the last four years \u2013 in my view, an encouraging trend. The growth was fairly broad along all major service lines, with the exception of pulmonary and OB\/GYN surgical discharges.","Same-facility uninsured admissions increased 11.6% in the first quarter. The growth in same-facility uninsured admissions accounted for 60 basis points of the 3.2 total admissions growth during the first quarter. Same-facility uninsured admissions represented 7.1% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 6.5% in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Same-facility total surgeries increased 2.3% in the quarter, when compared to the prior year, reflecting an increase in inpatient surgeries of 1.5% and outpatient surgeries of 2.7% an improvement from past quarters. The increase in inpatient surgeries did not result in an overall increase in same facility total case mix due to the fact that the increases occurred in less complex surgical DRGs as compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Growth in our emergency room visits remain strong in the first quarter increasing 5.3% compared to the prior year on a same facility basis. As you might remember, we had an extremely strong first quarter in 2011 with same facility ER visits increasing 11.3%.","Same facility revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by strong equivalent admission growth. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission excluding the Rural Floor Settlement, SSI adjustments, and the Texas Medicaid Waiver program declined 1.4% in the quarter. Various factors are influencing our revenue per equivalent admission, including higher growth of medical admissions in relation to surgical admissions, payor mix, and rate reductions in Florida and Texas Medicaid programs.","The same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission excluding the impact of the Rural Floor Settlement and the Medicare SSI adjustments declined 1.8% from the prior year, same facility Medicare case mix declined on 1.2% in the quarter. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission excluding Texas Medicaid Waiver program declined 10.2%, and that\u2019s generally consistent with prior quarters. If you include the reductions in the Texas Medicaid Waiver program, Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 13.4% compared to the prior year.","Managed care and other facility revenue per equivalent admission growth improved from the most recent quarterly trends, increasing 4.1% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of last year. Managed-care same facility case mix index increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by 412 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year, and during the first quarter same facility charity care discounts totaled 761 million, an increase of 129 million from the prior year while same facility uninsured discounts totaled 1.552 billion, an increase of 283 million from the prior year.","We were extremely pleased with expense management in the first quarter. As same facility operating expense per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid Waiver program, equity and earnings of affiliates, and high tech incentive income, increased 0.2% from the prior year period and as Richard mentioned, on the same facility basis our operating expense per equivalent admissions compared to prior year has been essentially flat for three consecutive quarters. Salaries per equivalent admission on a same facility basis increased 1.4% from the prior year, productivity performance improved 1.2% on the same facility basis compared to prior year, same facility wage growth was 1.8% for the quarter.","Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by 20.9% or $50 million from the first quarter of the prior year which is a reduction in rate of growth from the 2011 first quarter increase of 42.4% or $71 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission declined 2% from the prior year, reflecting minimal supply cost inflation which the company has been able to mitigate by many of our supply cost reduction initiatives. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission declined 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting several small reductions in various expenses.","As noted in our income statement released this morning, the company recognized $55 million in electronic health record income in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $18 million in HER-related expense in the first quarter compared to $20 million in the first quarter of 2011.","Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $797 million compared to $918 million last year. The decline was primarily due to an increase of $233 million in adjusted EBITDA, being offset by a $135-million decline in net tax refunds, a $116-million increase in interest paid related to the timing of coupon interest payments on newly refinanced debt, and a $103-million net reduction from the net change in operating assets and liabilities. And this would include the increases in AR from the Medicare settlement and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses.","CapEx for the quarter was $335 million compared to $329 million last year. Acquisitions totaled $112 million in the quarter. This includes one hospital, Galichia Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas, and other smaller acquisitions. Days in accounts receivable at March 31, 2012 were 53 compared to 49 days at March 31, 2011. The AR associated with the Medicare settlement adjustments accounted for about one-day increase and the recent acquisitions added one day.","At March 31, 2012, the company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times compared to 4.46 times at December 31, 2011 and compared to 4.62 times at December 31, 2011 pro forma for the February 2012 dividend of $955 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.75 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","Now, turning to our revised 2012 guidance. The revised guidance included in today\u2019s earnings release incorporates the net benefit of the previously discussed Medicare settlement adjustments. We have maintained our existing revenue range of $32 million to $33 billion, while increasing our adjusted EBITDA range by $170 million to $6.37 billion to $6.62 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share range by $0.22 to $3.50 to $3.77.","We are also revising our 2012 guidance relative to EHR development expenses from $160 million to $160 million \u2013 from $140 million to 160 million range to a new range of $125 million to $150 million. Our guidance remains unchanged for EHR incentive income, which is a range of $325 million to $350 million.","Let me turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel Hazen","Good morning. I\u2019ll begin my comments this morning on our volume for the first quarter and wrap up with an update on market share for the third quarter 2011, which is the most recent data available.","With respect to volume growth, the company had very good balance across our 15 divisions, again, this quarter and very good balance across our service lines. 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility inpatient admissions. All domestic divisions had growth in same-facility adjusted admissions.","13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility emergency room visits. The emergency room continues to be an area of focus for the company, both strategically and operationally. We have numerous hospitals that have enhanced their service offerings with certified trauma programs, comprehensive stroke programs, including telemedicine and accredited chest paint program. Additionally, we have invested capital to increase our emergency room bed capacity and expand our geographic access to new patients.","Last quarter, I reviewed our surgical growth initiative in detail. I am pleased to report that we had 12 out of 14 domestic divisions with same-facility total surgery growth for the quarter. We are still in the early stages of this effort, but we are encouraged by the results thus far.","Within surgery, we continue to see solid growth in orthopedic and neurosurgery services. This quarter we also saw strong growth in general surgery volume. Within cardiovascular service line, we grew 1.7% in overall surgical activity with certain cardiovascular procedures rebounding. Open-heart surgeries were down by 1% in the quarter. And finally, within our ambulatory surgery division, same-facility case volumes grew by 3% in the quarter.","Volumes in our intensive care units were up this quarter. ICU admissions on a same-facility basis were up 7.4% and same-facility admissions into our neonatal intensive care units were up 1.6%. Within these units we continue to see some length of stay declines, which can negatively affect our revenue per adjusted admissions for commercial business.","As Milton mentioned in his comments, growth in medical admissions was strong in the first quarter. We also had strong growth in both behavioral services and rehab services. Admissions were up 17% and 10%, respectively, for the first quarter as compared to the prior year.","Now let me wrap up my comments with an update on third-quarter market share data for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011. As a reminder, we typically have a 90 to 180-day delay in getting market share data to analyze. So this is the most current data available for 37 HCA markets and it represents approximately 90% of our hospitals.","In general there are two positive takeaways. First, market demand appears to be increasing. And two, HCA market share is growing. Market demand for this period grew 1.2% as compared to only 0.4% in the same twelve-month period in the previous year. HCA\u2019s market share for this period grew by 20 basis points to 23.1%. Within the various service lines, market demand grew across all categories except for women\u2019s and cardiovascular service lines. In particular, medicine and behavioral service lines grew by 4.9% combined. HCA was up in nine service lines, flat in four service lines and down in only three service lines.","Our growth plan continues to be focused on the following six areas. First, maintaining patients within our networks; two, expanding the markets that we serve; three is increasing the access to our facilities with capacity increases and new outreach sites; four developing high-quality service lines; five, solidifying physician engagement; and six, leveraging HCA scale. This plan is built on a foundation of quality outcomes, customer service and operational efficiency. We believe this growth plan is both producing gains in the marketplace today and positioning us to compete more effectively in the future for business.","That concludes my comments, and I\u2019ll turn the call back to Vic.","Vic Campbell","All right. With that, operator, would you solicit any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will now go first to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning.","Vic Campbell","Morning.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","I just wanted to reconcile the pricing statistic; I think you had said the same-store revenue, ex the settlements was up 2.7 compared to the kind of 4.8 on the adjusted admissions side, which means sort of pricing was down a little over 2. And I think in the prepared remarks you had said pricing was down 1.4, so I guess just to reconcile that. And maybe just if you could talk about the components of kind of the pure pricing acuity and payor mix along those lines? Thanks.","Vic Campbell","Milton, do you want to take that?","Milton Johnson","Sure. Yes, let me take a shot. There was a lot of parts and pieces to our revenue per unit because of the various impacts of Medicaid changes and the Texas Medicaid waiver program as well. So again, I think we \u2013 it\u2019s 1.4% decline Ralph. And that 1.4% compared to last year excludes the two Medicare adjustments in the period and also excludes the impact of the Texas waiver program.","If you include the impact of the Texas waiver program, the decline would be 2%. So I think that more closely reconciles to the overall revenue increase number which I gave you excluding the Medicare pickups, because that number did have the impact of the Texas waiver program.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just in terms of the dynamics\u2013?","Milton Johnson","Well, what we\u2019re seeing is, of course, we\u2019ve seen now Medicare was down 1.8% in terms of rate. We saw an acuity decrease there of 1.2%. So that again, we knew this would be a tough comp here in the first quarter. The case mix index for Medicare though continues to trend consistently going back, say, to the second quarter of 2011. So it was a difficult comp, and you saw that impacting our rate. But it\u2019s not inconsistent where we have been in recent quarters.","With respect to managed care, again, there the yield on our managed care book was 4.1% in the quarter. We saw a slight acuity increase of 0.6%. The 4.1% on a trend basis is the highest number we\u2019ve had in the last two quarters. If you recall in 2011, we started out last year up 5.5%. We dropped to about 4.8% in the second quarter down to 3.8%. And then in the fourth quarter of last year, of course, we\u2019re up only 1.3% in managed care. So a rebound now of 4.1% was a slight acuity increase.","And then on Medicaid again, we were down over just \u2013 down over 10% there, again reflecting the reductions that we\u2019re seeing in Medicaid reimbursements in Florida and Texas, primarily.","Vic Campbell","Good, Milt. Thanks. Thanks, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Adam Feinstein with Barclays.","Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays","All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Vic Campbell","Good morning.","Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays","I guess just \u2013 appreciate all of the details you guys gave us and just certainly the volume growth is just so much stronger than what the rest of the industry has been seeing. So, Sam, you made the comments with some of the data in terms of growing market share, as well as demand picking up in some of the markets. So just want to see if you could elaborate a little bit more, you know, which areas are you guys growing market share, and just trying to better understand in terms of what\u2019s driving that. So I know it\u2019s a tough question to answer, but just curious how long you guys are thinking about it.","Vic Campbell","All right. Sam is up to it.","Samuel Hazen","Well, I think we do have specific data through the third quarter. It doesn\u2019t reconcile necessarily to the fourth quarter and the first quarter volume metrics that we published. We do believe that the growth in the marketplace is probably still there for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2012, but again, we need to see the market share data to verify that. But again, the marketplace for all of HCA\u2019s markets grew as I indicated, and largely it was consistent across most of our markets. We do have some markets that grew in excess of that. Austin, Texas is a market that\u2019s continued to have strong demand. And then we have markets like Las Vegas where we were down 2% during this time period. So, again, the portfolio of the company I think has positioned us to benefit from inherent demand growth.","But when you look underneath the demand growth from a geographic standpoint and look at it from a service line standpoint, the business that we\u2019ve been seeing, our medicine business, our behavioral business, and sort of that kind of activity has grown. For example, medicine grew 4.7%, HCA grew 7% on that service line. So we picked up 60 basis points of share on the medicine business. I think that\u2019s partly due to our emergency room strategy where we continue to pick up share, we believe. And a lot of the activity that comes through the emergency room is medicine related.","In surgery, our surgical growth initiative we believe is gaining some traction, and we\u2019re benefiting from increased demand in orthopedics and neural sciences there, and we have picked up share in both of those service lines.","If you look at women\u2019s services, conversely, women\u2019s services is down for two reasons. One, GYN surgery has generally migrated to outpatient because of technology. And so we\u2019ve seen a drop in demand related to that. And then from an obstetrics standpoint, our delivery volumes have been down, and HCA is essentially flat in women services. So we\u2019ve seen no growth in our market share on women\u2019s services. And we have initiatives in place to try to deal with that.","So that\u2019s some color, Adam. I don\u2019t know if that really answers your question completely. But it gives you some sense of it. And again, when you look across the geography, HCA, I think picked up share during this time in 22 or 23 markets, and we lost share in 14 markets. And so the combined share gain was 20 basis points, suggesting that in our larger markets we picked up enough share to compensate for those markets that were down.","Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays","All right. Thank you very much. That was very helpful.","Vic Campbell","All right. Thanks, Adam.","Operator","And next we move to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a question here on the commercial pricing side of things. Could you just talk a little bit about the trends that you\u2019re seeing, commercial rate increases and any discussions that you might be having on commercial narrow networks or ACO-type products? And actually any thoughts about actually taking risk going forward on the commercial side.","Milton Johnson","Well maybe just \u2013 I mean on the rate side, of course, I think I just went through that we had a rebound relative to recent couple of quarters\u2019 performance with our managed-care rate. Still not yielding our contracted rate.","Again, we would have expected it to be, say, around 5.5% and 4.1% this quarter. As far as visibility into our managed-care revenue, we\u2019ve got about roughly 90% under contract for 2012, at that \u2013 call it 5% to 6% sort of increase.","We\u2019ve got about 60% of 2013 under contract and about 30% roughly of 2014. So, a lot of visibility into our managed-care revenue, and all that priced in that kind of 5% to 6% range contracted rate at this point.","And I\u2019m looking at Juan Vallarino. We\u2019re not seeing, Juan, any sort of changes in structure right now of our contracts and the like. So \u2013 and really nothing material with respect to ACOs or any sort of tighter networks at this point in time in our managed-care book.","Juan Vallarino","That\u2019s correct.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Well, the managed care companies seem to be talking a lot about that. Are you seeing your competitors do this, and you\u2019re not participating because it\u2019s too early, or how do you reconcile those two?","Juan Vallarino","No; I think there are conversations. I think that\u2019s all they are right now, is just feeling each other out for a period of time. I think you have to let it run its course, but we\u2019re having dialogue; it\u2019s just not materializing into contracts yet.","Milton Johnson","And that was Juan Vallarino. I think, Juan, too, that would be based upon our markets that we\u2019re in. And there could be other markets in the country where there could be more activity, but we\u2019re not seeing that in our markets at this point.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks.","Richard Bracken","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you very much for all the color. Obviously topline has been strong, but so was the cost side as you mentioned in some of your prepared remarks. Could you talk about maybe the sustainability of some of what we\u2019re seeing on the cost side and going forward where the major opportunities might be to the extent anything can get even better?","Milton Johnson","Richard, do you want to lead with that?","Richard Bracken","Well, I think I sort of indicated in my remarks that we\u2019ve been pretty successful in managing the cost side of our business over the last five quarters. And I guess in terms of thinking ahead and what\u2019s still out there, I mean managing cost and reengineering how we provide healthcare services is absolutely a daily effort at the company.","We \u2013 and I\u2019ve stated in the past, we benefit \u2013 our cost structure to a certain extent benefits from the less intense service mix that we\u2019ve reported, and the lesser surgery volumes; we get an automatic ride with that. But in terms of reengineering how we provide healthcare, our agenda is very complete.","We see this as the next era of how appropriately cost can be taken out of the system, whether it\u2019s in length of stay management, efficient care algorithms and the like. And actually the company has got a huge effort underway with our medical leadership designing those programs as we speak.","To sit there and put a number on it right now would be premature. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we believe this to be where the industry needs to be, certainly where we\u2019re taking HCA, to provide highest value for the dollar spent. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity going forward.","We\u2019ll continue in the traditional avenues of expense management. We\u2019re not seeing wage rate pressure, given where the economy is. But in terms of reinventing healthcare, that\u2019s really where our attention is at this point in time.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","On the supply side, how do you expect the medical device tax to ultimately play through on your side of the coin?","Richard Bracken","Medical device tax.","Milton Johnson","Sam, you?","Samuel Hazen","We\u2019re not anticipating a pass-through to that effect. I mean we have contracts that are already established with our vendors through our HPG organization. And as those contracts get negotiated, I presume there will be discussion about that, but at this particular point in time, we\u2019re not anticipating any kind of pass-through related to the medical device tax that\u2019s embedded in the Affordable Care Act.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Milton Johnson","Thanks Tom.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from A.J. Rice with UBS.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Hello, everybody. I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask about the Parallon initiative and see if there\u2019s an update on that. And specifically maybe comment \u2013 I know Accretive Health has been in the paper lately. Does that present any opportunities for you guys?","Richard Bracken","Milton, do you want to address that?","Milton Johnson","Sure, yes. Parallon development, A. J., we continue to see progress there. We have several discussions underway for supply chain as well as revenue cycle, and we will see over time how those work out, of course. We\u2019re seeing also good traction in our workforce management section of Parallon as well. So we of course have new leadership in Parallon with Beverly\u2019s retirement and with Michael O\u2019Boyle coming in, and we are looking forward to seeing his contributions going forward as well.","With respect to the accretive situation, A.J., I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s too early to tell where that\u2019s going to play out as to whether that will present an opportunity or not.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, A.J.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Thanks.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, thanks, guys. If you look back and \u2013 at the current quarter, recognizing that you\u2019ve done a lot from your own execution. Can you see a pattern here on commercial utilization that makes sense to you relative to the timing of the recession? Did you know, do you see that trough in 2010 that the managed care companies point to?","And any sense that you have on the pickup in volumes that you are seeing to the extent \u2013 it\u2019s not just a market share thing where it might be more insured, commercially insured patients versus patients feeling a little bit more ready to use healthcare services?","Richard Bracken","Sam, do you want that one? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","Well, we are still studying our third-quarter market share data, and we do have within certain markets very good and accurate payer mix data within our market share metrics. And in those markets we have seen, if you look at sort of the sequential quarterly performance of those markets, not HCA performance, just the overall market, a reduction in the rate of decline related to commercial admission activity.","It hasn\u2019t necessarily rebounded to where there is growth in the metrics yet, that could be in place in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Again we don\u2019t have that data. But in some of the markets where we do have good commercial payer activity, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in the rate of decline, it\u2019s still not positive. Within our own metrics, we are seeing more commercial activity in our emergency services. Milton mentioned that we actually had probably the best metric on commercial admission activity this past quarter. I do sense that we are picking up some market share, but it could be that there is some lift in the marketplace as well with respect to overall commercial demand.","And so as we move through \u201811 and we did see better metrics on that front versus 2010. And we are hopeful, as I indicated on the last call, that we are going to continue to see those trends progress into 2012.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Group","Good morning, everyone. Oh, there\u2019s so many questions to pick from. Okay.","Vic Campbell","Be kind.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Group","Yes, okay. I\u2019m going to ask you this one. HealthONE clearly helped on the volume side. And \u2013 but you know as I look at the EBITDA on \u2013 excluding the high tech and excluding the Medicare settlement dollars, you\u2019re to be commended given all the headwinds on pricing that this is flat.","But I guess I\u2019ll ask the question, and is HealthONE as accretive as you and we hoped it would be, and the base business is just that much deteriorated because of the pricing? Or am I looking at this wrong? And is that linked to the performance and cash flow this quarter at all?","Vic Campbell","All right. Good question. Milt, do you want that one?","Milton Johnson","Sure. Yes, I mean, first of all, HealthONE is performing as we expected, actually, I think slightly better than we expected. And so when you look at the base business, as we say, we are being negatively impacted by the revenue changes, the reimbursement changes in Medicaid. And Sheryl, I know you recall these, but just \u2013 we are going through roughly about a $13 million per month reduction in Medicare reimbursement when you combine the impact \u2013 monthly impact of Texas and Florida.","And then in addition to that in this quarter there was a $40 million reduction in revenue from the Texas Medicaid program. Now we had about a $10 million reduction in related expenses, so about a $30 million negative impact in the quarter. So you do the math on that and that\u2019s a lot of headwinds hitting EBITDA here in the first quarter relative to just governmental reimbursement changes. And so despite that, as your analysis just went through, we\u2019re basically flat on an EBITDA basis including HealthONE.","So \u2013 and with respect to cash flow, clearly, the cash flow being down was related to less tax refunds for the first quarter versus a year ago. And then the other piece was interest payments. And its where we \u2013 with some of our refinanced debt, we changed the coupon payment dates. And so now we have more interest being due in the first quarter in 2012 than we had coupons being due in 2011.","As Richard mentioned in his notes the actual interest expense on the accounting side on an accrual basis declined $91 million year-over-year. So this is strictly a timing of payments impacting our cash flow. And we should see that normalized out later in the year of course as we pick up the favorable impact of the timing on interest payments.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Group","Okay, great. Thank you.","Vic Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Hi. Good morning, everybody. One clarification and one question, so I\u2019m going to hope the clarification doesn\u2019t count as my question.","Vic Campbell","It depends on what it is.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","The clarification is, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I guess I wasn\u2019t paying close attention early on, Milt, but on the net revenue per \u2013 the same-store net revenue per adjusted admission figure, were you saying that the Medicare settlement was in there and really that plus 0.3 was a minus 2? Is that what Ralph was clarifying? I got confused there.","Milton Johnson","No. I think the number I gave was we were down 1.4%, and that excludes the two special Medicare adjustments we had during the first quarter. It excludes the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program impact.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","So I\u2019m sorry, so 0.3 you\u2019re showing includes \u2013 that includes the Medicare settlement?","Milton Johnson","Yes. That includes the Medicare settlement; that\u2019s correct.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","So the same-store revenue growth is 3.4% in the quarter, is that right, if you exclude the Medicare settlement?","Milton Johnson","No. I think how we get there \u2013 you think about same-store, we had volume growth of, I think, it was 4.8% adjusted admissions. Then if you factor in on the same facility basis, take out the two Medicare settlements, the Texas waiver, and I\u2019m sorry, leave the Texas waiver program in, we get about the 2% reduction in net revenue per adjusted admissions same-store, which would net out to roughly 2.7%, 2.8% same facility top-line revenue growth.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Okay. That\u2019s still better than we thought given how much tougher the comp got. And now of course, I\u2019ve completely forgotten what my question was. Texas, the additional pending changes to UPL and DSH, did I miss an early comment on that as well, just kind what you guys are thinking? Obviously you must think plausible outcomes are within your range of guidance, but is there anything else that you said about it?","Samuel Hazen","We didn\u2019t say anything else about it in the discussion, Gary. But Texas just recently published some proposed rules around disproportionate share payments in the state. That has initiated the rule making process. We are actively engaged in the rule making process, and think there will be some adjustments to what is proposed. And at this particular point in time we really don\u2019t have any specificity around that. But we are actively engaged on that. As it relates to UPL program, there are still developments and discussions related to the two components of the waiver program. Those won\u2019t be resolved probably until late this year. And so we really don\u2019t have anything else to guide you on as it relates to that program either.","Vic Campbell","Thanks, Gary.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we will hear from Deepak Raja with Broad Arch Capital.","Deepak Raja \u2013 Broad Arch Capital","Thanks. First, thank you for the dividend, and I wanted to know when I\u2019m going to get the next one. But my real question is 2013, I guess we\u2019re all talking about Medicare cuts, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in Washington, but can you kind of guide me a little bit as to how much of a cut you can take on the Medicare side and still maintain your growth profile?","Vic Campbell","Let me \u2013 this is Vic, and let me just address what has been proposed. The IPPS rule and I think everyone saw it come out a week ago, and it was a positive adjustment. However, once you put the 2% sequester against it, you\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s flat to down for most folks, including us. So we are disappointed with the proposed rule, in particular the coding and outlier adjustments. And we will be working with Federation, AHA and all hospitals to provide appropriate comments and indicate why those cuts should not be there.","And as some have pointed out, many of you on the call, that history shows that the final rule often differs from the proposed rule. We hope that\u2019s the case again this year but time will tell, but we will be working on that. But net-net, if you look at what has been proposed, we have an increase in the fourth quarter of something between 1% and 2%, before the sequester; then the sequester, if it kicks in early next year, obviously, it takes that away and you\u2019re looking at something less. So, but again, it\u2019s early on. I don\u2019t know, Milt, if you want to address anything further than that, but that\u2019s what we \u2013 in fact, thank you. And thank you for the comment on the dividend.","Deepak Raja \u2013 Broad Arch Capital","I\u2019m waiting for the next one, so I am here.","Operator","Next we will go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. So my question is really around M&A and acquisition environment. You\u2019ve stuck to your knitting for the most part with M&A doing a lot of tuck-in in market type deals and things that you\u2019ve operated in the past, like in Denver. I guess the real quest question here is what are you seeing out there, do you think geographically we\u2019ll see any change in the strategy, and given the fact that after having just paid that dividend to your shareholder, like, your leverage is basically flat sequentially. Does that suggest that at this leverage level you might be comfortable doing a little bit more M&A?","Vic Campbell","Richard?","Richard Bracken","Yeah. Well, first of all, relative to acquisition strategy, and our strategy to some extent is independent of geography. When we talk about acquisitions, we \u2013 our primary filter of course is as you mentioned, existing markets, some things that are supportive and additive in existing markets. But we obviously look at new markets if we can create a substantial presence or see a way to create a substantial presence over time, and on that filter we\u2019re open.","We did it in Kansas City where we had nothing; that was the last big one. But as we think this market continues to consolidate with the revenue pressures that are out there, there might well be new geographies that are presented to us and our strategy will be the same.","Can we, for a fair price, buy assets, typically troubled? Do we have a view where we can be a major market share player in that? In that, can we bring our shared service agenda to create value? And if we can do that in a disciplined way, we will execute.","And I think it\u2019s a fair question that you asked. We\u2019ve asked ourselves that question. Do we have to commit ourselves to very, very large urban markets? Well, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at; that\u2019s our core business. But I think we look at everything in this period of change, and we apply the strategy across all opportunity.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And is the environment changing for you, just as you think about the pipeline of deals that you have right this moment?","Richard Bracken","Is the environment \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I miss the question.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is your pipeline much different today than, say, it was a year or so ago? Maybe just help us think about the M&A piece over the next 12, 24 months.","Richard Bracken","Well, I definitely think \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly sure what you define as a pipeline. There is certainly the inbounds. The opportunities in the marketplace are much greater than they have been in recent times, and we are processing all those.","I would be quick to point out, though, that we are disciplined buyers. And just because something is for sale doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re necessarily going to jump all over it. We have a formula, we feel it important in this time with a certain amount of revenue uncertainty to stick to that formula, and it served us well. I think our track record speaks for itself.","We do see acquisition opportunities increasing, as we have said. It\u2019s certainly different now than it was even three years ago. We have actually added resources to our M&A function as you know, and so we\u2019re being very thoughtful about how to be productive in this new environment.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s helpful.","Vic Campbell","All Right. Thank you, Darren. Probably time for just one more question.","Operator","With that, our final question then will come from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for slipping me in. I guess I just had a general question around the IT strategy and high tech, and Milton, I\u2019m just sort of curious where you guys are relative to your IT work plan at this point, and maybe how that\u2019s met up with expectations. And if you could comment on cost and just any general commentary for how we should think about the next step, when you guys are thinking about stage two.","Milton Johnson","Sure. Well, let me just say first of all that our IT strategy is primarily around the clinical agenda as you can imagine. Currently, we are about six months into a development of the clinical data warehouse. We\u2019re also working on the health information exchange. And of course as we\u2019ve discussed before, we have a couple of pilots going on; one with Meditech 6.0 version, and another pilot with Epic.","And so we need to see the outcome of those pilots, but \u2013 and then make some decisions about how we go forward with a new clinical system. That will be a multi-year sort of implementation. We don\u2019t have all the cost estimates on that yet. That is what the pilots will help us inform us as to how we should think about cost and again how we should formulate implementation plans. So we\u2019re a little too early to talk about that. But certainly our IT agenda is very full right now, and it is going well. And again, it\u2019s primarily around the clinical agenda.","Vic Campbell","All right. Whit, I thank \u2013 you very much. I thank everyone. Mark and I are both here, happy to take your calls. You all have a great day.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s call.

And welcome to the HCA Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Release Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Vic Campbell","Lila, thank you and good morning to everyone on today\u2019s call and to those of you who are listening on the webcast. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I\u2019m pleased to host you here this morning.","With us, our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operation. We also have several other members of the HCA senior management team here this morning to assist during the Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they\u2019re based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today, many of the factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company\u2019s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard the call is being recorded, a replay will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.","Richard Bracken","Okay. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to all. We do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. We have a lot to cover today so let me get to it. I\u2019ll start by providing some overall observations for the year, and then Milton and Sam will follow with detailed review of the fourth quarter\u2019s financial and operating results. Milton will then close this morning with our 2012 guidance and some of the key assumptions in that guidance.","Let me begin by saying that we are generally pleased with how our operating teams navigated through some pretty significant challenges the hospital industry faced in 2011. We ended the year not expecting to see significant improvement in unemployment rates and other key economic indicators, and also knowing that hospitals would not receive a Medicare payment rate increase for at least three quarters of the year.","In addition, we expect that the Medicaid payment pressures in certain states but as you now know we ended up with a greater than anticipated Medicaid rate cuts in both Florida and Texas in the second half of the year and as we have discussed at length in our call beginning with the second quarter of 2011, we have experienced a service mix shift from surgical to medical admissions.","Despite these significant challenges we produce revenue growth of nearly 6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 3.3%. During 2011 we made significant investments in technology and our clinical quality and patient service agendas, and our market based service line strategies, and we\u2019re confident these investments will continue to serve us very well in the future.","We\u2019re particularly pleased with the successful efforts of our operating teams to adjust their offering operating cost in the second half of the year to offset the greater than anticipated revenue per admission pressures.","In our third quarter, our same facility operating expense per equivalent admission was flat and in the fourth quarter we actually saw four-tenth percent decline in our same facility operating expense per equivalent admissions.","For the full year, our operating expense per equivalent admission rose only 1.4% reflecting strong management of both overhead and variable expenses, while still supporting important growth initiatives. As we\u2019ve discussed before part of our ability to manage operating costs effectively as result of our continued strong volume growth. This proved true throughout each quarter of 2011.","For the full year, our admissions grew 4.2% equivalent admissions were up 5.2% and emergency room visits were up 7.7%. On a same facility basis admissions grew 2.3% equivalent admissions 3% and ER visits up 6.2%.","We now have experienced 17 straight quarters of same facility equivalent admission growth, and Milton and Sam will provide some more color on our volume growth in a few minutes, but let me just say that we believe this growth not only confirms our favorable facility locations in areas with good population growth dynamics but also reflects an operating agenda that seeks greater efficiency and effectiveness in how we process patients through our hospital, equally important in this strategy is our commitment to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the overall patient experience.","As you might\u2019ve noticed in our release this morning, our cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.9 billion in 2011. These funds along with the proceeds from our March IPO of approximately $2.5 billion gave us significant financial flexibility in 2011.","During 2011, we made capital investments of approximately $1.7 billion in our existing facilities and markets. We invested $1.45 billion to acquire full ownership of our HealthONE partnership in Denver and on prior calls we\u2019ve talked at length about the benefits we foresee in this market in the coming years.","You\u2019ll also recall that in September this past year we successfully repurchased more than 80 million shares of our common stock which was owned by Bank of America representing approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We paid approximately $1.5 billion to purchase these shares at $18.61 a share, obviously an accretive transaction for our shareholders.","In addition, we were able to refinance and extend a significant amount of our LBO debt during 2001 at favorable rates and as a result, our near-term debt maturities had been substantially reduced and we will realize meaningful interest savings.","We have consistently said since returning to the public market that we plan to be flexible in determining the best usages of our cash flow, even with these substantial investments I just mentioned, we lowered our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio from a little over 4.8 times at the end of 2010 to just under 4.5 times at the end of 2011.","As stated in our release this morning, our Board has approved a special cash dividend of $2 per share of common stock providing liquidity to our shareholders. This payout should not affect our ability to invest in our markets or impair our acquisition strategy. It\u2019s important to note that the impact on our leverage from this dividend will be modest.","A discussion of HCA highlights for 2011 would be incomplete without recognizing the 76 HCA hospitals named among the 405 U.S. hospitals identified by the joint commission for accreditation of hospital organizations as top performers on key quality measures.","You may recall in September that the Joint Commission recognized these hospitals for evidence based care processes, closely linked to positive patient outcomes, we\u2019re proud that 20% of those hospitals recognized are HCA facilities.","And finally, I want to commend our operating quality performance and IT&S teams who are responsible for the very successful rollout of our EHR in 2011, allowing virtually all HCA hospitals to meet Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements during the first year.","We are pleased to be among the leaders in what we believe is an important foundational step in our ability to create a clinical data set to assist in the provision of more cost efficient and effective healthcare services.","And finally on February 1st we closed on an acquisition of an 82-bed hospital in Wichita, Kansas, that complements our 760-bed Wesley Medical Center and we are pleased to welcome them to our organization.","So, with that, let turn the call over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all. I hope each of you have had the opportunity to review the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings release issued this morning. We have a lot of moving parts in this quarter, while attempt to clarify major issues, as well as provide more insight into our 2012 earnings guidance provided in today\u2019s earnings release. ","As Richard mentioned, the fourth quarter results provided strong volume growth and excellent expense management. We did, however, continue to experience an unfavorable shift in service mix compared to the prior year, along with Medicaid reductions in a couple of states, which resulted in lower revenue per equivalent admission growth.","Before I begin to get into the details, let me point out that this is the first quarter that our HealthONE joint venture is now fully consolidated in our financial and operating stats. It is not included in same facility financials or operating metrics.","We are accounted for investment in HealthONE using the equity method through October of 2011. With our share of the operations all recorded in the line item equity and earnings of affiliates in our consolidated income statement. Our share of HealthONE\u2019s earnings represented approximately 90% of the total equity in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated income statements for each of the last three years.","We began consolidating HealthONE\u2019s operations in our consolidated income statement beginning November 2011 and the equity earnings of affiliate line item has been and is expected to continued to be significantly reduced compared to periods prior to November 2011.","Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $7.769 billion, primarily driven by increased patient volume and the consolidation of the HealthONE joint venture. Same facility revenues increased 2.2%.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. in the fourth quarter totaled $1.935 billion or $4.25 per diluted share. This includes a pretax gain on acquisition of controlling interest in our equity investment in HealthONE of $1.522 billion or $3.13 per diluted share, reflecting the remeasurement to estimated fair value of our investment in HealthONE following our acquisition of remaining 40% ownership from the Colorado Health Foundation.","Also, in the fourth quarter results include a pretax on sales and facilities of $145 million or $0.18 per diluted share, primarily reflecting the sale of our Palmyra Medical Center in the quarter. Tax rate in the quarter was favorably impacted due to the majority of the HealthONE gain being a non-taxable item.","During the fourth quarter, same facility admissions increased 2.5% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.2% each compared to the prior year fourth quarter.","As noted in this morning\u2019s release, excluding international facilities, patient volume growth in the quarter was primarily driven by medical admissions which increased 4.8%, while surgical admissions declined at 1.8% on a same facility basis. This is fairly consistent with the prior two quarters.","We continue to see our patient volume growth resulting primarily from governmental payers. However, we have seen some improving trends in our commercial payer volume. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 4.2% and 4.8% respectively in the quarter.","Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 8.1% on a on a same facility basis and represents 24.2% of our total Medicare admission.","Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 3.1% and same facility equivalent admissions increased 4.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter same facility managed care and other admissions decline 0.7%. However, same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.8% compared to the prior year. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have experienced growth in managed care equivalent admissions.","Same facility total surgeries declined 1.8% compared to the prior year, reflecting a decline in inpatient surgeries of 2.1% and outpatient surgeries of 1.6%.","Same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.2% or 1,399 admits in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represents 7.2% of total admits in the quarter, compared to 7% in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.","We continue to experience strong growth in the company\u2019s ER visits, a major driver of hospital inpatient volume. During the fourth quarter the same facility ER visits increased 4.4% compared to the prior year.","Same facility revenue growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by solid equivalent admissions growth. The continued shift in our medical mix during the quarter is reflected in the same facility revenue per equivalent admission decline of 1% during the fourth quarter.","Our same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. Same facility Medicare case mix index decreased 1% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. However, it increased sequentially 0.5% from the third quarter of 2011.","Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission excluding UPL declined by 10.4%, primarily reflecting reimbursement reductions in Taxes and Florida. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission including UPL reductions declined 14.2% in the quarter compared to the prior year.","Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission growth was below recent trend, increasing 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting an unfavorable shift in service mix. Managed care and other case mix index for the quarter declined 0.7%. We experienced year-over-year declines in neonatal patient volumes, as well as cardiovascular surgery and spine surgery.","Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by $269 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $680 million, an increase of $76 million from prior year, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.348 billion, an increase of $193 million in the prior year.","We were very pleased with expense management in the fourth quarter, as same facility operating expense per equivalent admission declined 0.4% compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, operating expense per equivalent admission increased 0.6%.","Salaries per equivalent admission on a same facility basis increased 0.7% in the quarter when compared to the prior year. Hospital-only productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission improved 3%, while the company improved 2.2% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year.","Wage rate growth was 1.8% for the fourth quarter on a same facility basis. Same facility personnel cost associated with our physician employment company increased $39 million to $249 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter.","Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline in surgical volumes and continued effective execution of our supply chain initiative. Same facility other operating expense increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter consistent with prior quarters.","The company recognized $120 million of EHR incentive income related to the Meaningful Use of certified EHR technology and approximately $19 million of EHR-related expenses in the fourth quarter. In response to new accounting guidance, the company revised its accounting recognition of income from EHR incentive payments.","EHR incentive income is not included in revenues but is presented as a separate line item in our consolidated income statement. For the year, EHR incentive income totaled $210 million and we incurred $77 million of EHR-related expenses. During 2011, the company received $306 million in EHR incentive cash payments.","For the fourth quarter, cash flows from operating activities increased to $1.387 billion from $534 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in working capital items of $388 million and $467 million related to income tax.","CapEx for the fourth quarter increased to $509 million from $465 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, $14 million of the increase reflects the consolidation of the HealthONE joint venture.","Based on account receivable, December 31, 2011 were 53 days compared to 50 days at the end of the third quarter and 49 days at December 31, 2010.","At December 31, 2011, the company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.46 times, compared to 4.81 times at December 31, 2010. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.137 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","We will use available cash and the company\u2019s credit facilities to fund this morning\u2019s announcement of a special dividend of $2 per share or approximately $952 million. Our leverage ratio pro forma for the dividend as of 12\/31\/11 4.63 times.","Now before going to Sam, let me go ahead and cover our 2012 guidance. We estimate that for 2012, consolidated revenues for HCA should range from $32 billion to $33 billion. Included in our estimate is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in revenue from HealthONE. Our estimate does not include any additional revenues from acquisitions that may be completed in 2012.","Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate a range from $6.2 billion to $6.45 billion for the year, while earnings per diluted share we estimate a range from $3.35 to $3.55 for 2012.","On a same facility basis, we expect overall volume growth at a slightly lower rate than 2011. HealthONE will be included in our consolidated volume stats, but will not be included in same facility stats.","On a consolidated basis, we expect equivalent admission growth to range from 7% to 8% for the year. On a same facility basis, we expect equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for the year.","With respect to net revenue per equivalent admission growth, we expect to continue to see unfavorable rate impact from changes and service mix during the first quarter of 2012. But we expect less rate impact from service mix changes for the remaining three quarters of 2012.","On a consolidated basis excluding UPL, we expect net revenue per equivalent admission growth in the range of 3% to 3.5% for 2012. On a same facility basis excluding UPL, we expect net revenue per equivalent admission growth in the range of 1.5% to 2%.","Our guidance assumes an expense growth outlook that will continue to benefit from our low inflationary environment. We will continue to invest in our clinical and EHR development strategy. Our total expense growth is modeled based upon our expected revenue growth for 2012.","Our guidance includes estimated EHR incentive income in a range of $325 million to $350 million and EHR-related expenses in a range of $140 million to $160 million. Also, capital expenditures for 2012 should range from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with the increase primarily reflecting for change and recognition of HealthONE-related capital expenditures.","So, with that, I\u2019ll pause and turn the call over to Sam.","Sam Hazen","Good morning. I\u2019m going to focus my comments on more details related to the volumes statistic this quarter. I\u2019ll begin with a look inside our portfolio to give you some perspective on the performance across the market.","Once again, the company had very good balance across our 16 divisions with respect to volume growth for the quarter as compared to the previous year. All 15 domestic divisions had year-over-year same facilities admission growth.","The range of growth was a low of 0.3% to a high of 8.2%. 13 out of 16 divisions had year-over-year growth in same facilities adjusted admissions and of the three that did not have growth, one was flat and the other two were down 1% or less.","14 out of 15 domestic divisions had growth in same facilities emergency room visits as compared to the prior year. Of this, 11 divisions had growth in excess of 3% with a high of 9.5%. The only division that did not have growth was down 0.3% year-over-year.","Surgical volumes were down again this quarter as compared to the prior year. The trend was not materially different than previous quarters this year. Within surgery, cardiovascular volume trends slightly improved in total.","Inpatient cardiovascular surgeries were down 3.6% for the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is a slight improvement over the September year-to-date trend which was a decline of around 5%. We did see a deteriorating trend in the most revenue intensive component of cardiovascular surgeries with open-heart related cardiovascular cases being down for the quarter 7.8%. Year-to-date September, we were down only 1.5%. This trend change was a significant component of the managed care revenue softness for the quarter with commercial volumes in this category down 19%, as compared to 5% through September.","The company has rolled out a comprehensive surgery growth initiative which is designed to improve our surgical volumes. We are implementing this initiative in a manner similar to our emergency room initiative, which has yielded positive results for the company over the past few years.","Included as part of this initiative are enhancements to the process of scheduling surgical cases. These enhancements which include improvement in both process and technology will make it easier and more efficient for our physicians to schedule cases, while at the same time, increasing our operating room capacity. Also, we are dedicating additional capital spending in our budget to enhance further the technology and equipment necessary to attract more surgeons.","We have increased the resources in our physician outreach and communication function to ensure that any operational scheduling or equipment issues are addressed in a timely manner, also as part of this initiative, we have established that each of our hospitals have surgical services advisory council to ensure that both certain operating standards are met and our physician to have the necessary input into our surgical operations.","We believe this additional effort, coupled with our comprehensive service line strategy will help differentiate us in the market over time and allow us to continue to grow market share and improved clinical outcome.","And one final point on volume, which we also believe to be a part of the explanation for our managed care revenue softness is on our women\u2019s and children\u2019s services. Deliveries were down this quarter 2.4% on a same facility basis. Through September, we were down 0.8%, most of the difference this quarter is explained by Medicaid volume and not managed care volume. Managed care deliveries were actually up this quarter by 1.9%. Year-to-date, they were down 1.3%.","Normally, this translates into more neonatal volume, but in the fourth quarter our managed care neonatal patient days were down 6.5% with length of stay accounting for 3.6% of this decline. Length of stay is generally a proxy for acuity in our neonatal units. Through September, the length of stay for our managed care neonatal business was down only 1.2%.","This decline in conjunction with the decline in open-heart surgical volume explains a large portion of the change in managed care revenue for the fourth quarter. We are confident in our women\u2019s and children\u2019s service line strategy and believe them to be well-crafted to compete effectively in the marketplace.","To wrap up, I want to provide you with our perspective as we head into 2012 on a broader trend across HCA\u2019s market. We have studied the macro trends in our market and in addition to the forecast that Milton provided in his comments, our revenue guidance for 2010 is built in part on the following four observations.","First, market demand for in-patient services is strengthening some and we are forecasting it to grow overall in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Second, market demand for emergency services should remain strong and continue to grow in the 2% to 3% range. Third, commercial enrollment and volume should remain stable. And fourth, the competitive landscape is anticipated to remain largely unchanged in comparison to 2011.","We have seen our market share growth some over the past year as a result of our service line strategy, capital investment strategy, position alignment strategy and quality improvement strategy. As we move into 2012, we are anticipating a continuation of this performance.","And, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Vic.","Vic Campbell","Thank you, Richard and Milton. Lila, would you like to come back on and we\u2019ll poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Our first questions comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.","Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone and great news on the dividend payment. I guess, I just want to ask on the volume side. Clearly, your volumes had been stronger than what the market growth rate has been and Sam, I appreciated the details you gave earlier. I just wanted to just get some additional thoughts in terms of, as you guys think about the markets you\u2019re in and just what maybe going on there with demographics and everything else. Just curious if, how you\u2019re thinking about, your overall market share and then just on the mix question with the volumes, I guess just, what is your sense in terms of the mix impact on other hospitals in the same markets?","Richard Bracken","All right, Adam. Thank you. Sam, do you want to start out, basically he\u2019s asking about market share and the mix shift.","Sam Hazen","Just to remind everybody once again. Our market share data is somewhat lagging and to date we are starting to get in third quarter market share data in certain markets and we have better market share data through the second quarter.","And for HCA on a 12-month running basis, our market share has grown modestly and a markets like that has been slightly flat to up maybe 0.5 point over the 12-month period. And what we have seen inside that market share is generally statistics that are reflective of what we\u2019ve been reporting.","For example, women services during this time period have been down 3.5% and HCA\u2019s market share is modestly down like 5 basis point. Our cardiology, for example, has been down about 4% in the market and HCA\u2019s picked-up market share around 9 basis points.","So within the different categories our market share trend are generally favorable, but reflective of the overall volume trends that we\u2019ve reported over the year. I will say that I think as the year has progressed, we have picked-up slightly more market share than what we\u2019ve reported through the second quarter with the volumes that we reported in the third quarter, as well as the volumes that we reported in the fourth quarter.","I haven\u2019t seen this specific service line data yet to understand whether or not we\u2019re gaining or losing market share within the different service lines, but as soon as we get that information, we study it and we work with our division President\u2019s to ensure that the information is being used to adjust our strategies and so forth. Milton, did you want to add something to it.","Milton Johnson","Just one other comment, as you know our market share data is inpatient-only, it doesn\u2019t capture the outpatient activity. And the company, has been seeing very strong emergency room, volume growth over the past year, over 6% as Richard mentioned for the year just ended 2011. I think that strategy and the growth we\u2019re seeing in our emergency rooms contributing to the overall adjusted admission growth that we were reporting especially over the last two quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks, good morning.","Richard Bracken","Good morning.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","It seems like your operating expense, you had better success controlling it in the second half of the year than maybe you did in the first half of the year. And it sounds like from your comments you expect that to generally continue into next year. Any concern as you get into the second half of 2012? If there is anything specific, did anniversaries that might make some of the operating expense benefits, a little bit more difficult to get?","Richard Bracken","Mil, can you take that?","Milton Johnson","Well, sure. I think overall, no doubt during the second half of 2012 our comps will become more difficult with the operating expense performance that we have generated in 2011. I\u2019m not aware of any particular item out there.","I do think, as I have said in the comments, a low inflationary period. We\u2019re projecting that\u2019s going to carry through the year. We have attractive supplier initiative underway that we think will also help us. If we see a stabilization and the service mix which we\u2019re calling for really in the second, third and fourth quarter of next year, that may put some year-over-year comp pressure on supply costs, but I don\u2019t consider that to be a major headwind for us.","So, I do think our costs, overall trends should be similar, but I think it would be more difficult in the second half of the year, certainly more difficult than you will see in the first quarter of 2012.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Just on the balance sheet, if you look at the other accrued expenses accrued in the fourth quarter, is there anything in particular there is that primarily just the addition of HealthONE to the balance sheet?","Milton Johnson","Yeah. Got to -- if I understand, this deferred HITECH revenue...","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Right.","Milton Johnson","Deferred income.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question comes from with Justin Lake with UBS. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake \u2013 UBS","Thanks, good morning. Just question around the EBITDA numbers for this year and just how you\u2019re thinking about the bigger picture from growth perspective? I think you have typically talked the EBITDA growth for the business being mid single digits. I\u2019m backing into about 1% ex-items this year for healthcare IT and HealtONE. It makes sense. I know there are a number of moving parts, so I\u2019m hoping you can do just two things, one, can you walk us through the moving parts that are a headwind for this? I\u2019m thinking UPL, Medicaid, just kind of level set us. Give us a quick comment in terms of, do you still think the longer term growth for EBITDA in this business is at 5%, 6%?","Milton Johnson","Of course, the range of EBITDA growth based on the $6.2 billion to $6.45 billion, of course, would be 2.3% to 6.4% EBITDA growth all-in compared to 2011. If you look at some of the major, major pieces of it and walk through it, and again there\u2019s different ways of cutting this no doubt and looking at it. We\u2019re looking at next year in our guidance probably around 80 basis points to 1% sort of tailwind from HITECH. We\u2019re also looking in the neighborhood of probably around 4% or so of tailwind from HealthONE included in that guidance.","Now, the headwinds we\u2019ve got are primarily, of course, it\u2019s going to be the UPL, which I think we\u2019ve guidance of probably $80 million to $90 million sort of hit there with respect to UPL, and then on Texas Medicaid, there should be about $60 million headwind there versus $20 million that we had this year. So a net $40 million impact on the growth rate. So, if you take all that into account, the pluses and minuses, we\u2019re showing the underlying business growing about probably in that 1.5 to 3 range, somewhere in that zone.","Justin Lake \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial.","A.J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Thanks, everybody. Just thought I might ask you to update us on anything new or different we\u2019re talking about on the Parallon initiative and then specifically, the supply cost there, you\u2019ve alluded to that a couple of times and I know last quarter you talked about our far east initiative on basic supplies any update on that as well.","Richard Bracken","Milton, you want to go again?","Milton Johnson","Yeah, I mean, Richard on Parallon, first of all here with us this morning is Michael O\u2019Boyle who just joined us in January as our new CEO of Parallon of course to replace Beverly Wallace who retired at the end of the year. We are very, very happy to have Michael on board and his guidance of Parallon over the coming years.","Really when we look at the supply agenda with respect to HPG we continue to see a good growth opportunities from HPG. We continue to see opportunities again with our contracting strategies especially as we roll out some strategies around medical devices and it\u2019s a very market by market approach. It\u2019s a very sensitive approach to our physicians but it is one that we believe we\u2019ll continue to be able to yield results.","One example is that we bring our supply chain strategies into the EHR opportunities there as well. So we have a lot of opportunity there with respect to, I think you\u2019re mentioning or referencing our outsourcing imitative in China. That continues to develop at this point that initiative is not having a material impact on the company, but one we\u2019re continuing to develop in 2012.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I wanted to just ask a little bit about managed care contracting how it\u2019s evolving in 2012 what your general pricing outlook is on Sam, you\u2019ve obviously given us commentary on mix. So thanks for that, but maybe more from the standpoint of how contracting is going and are you seeing bundled structures at this point in our networks just how you see that evolving in \u201812?","Richard Bracken","Juan, do you want to do that? Juan Vallarino, Heads up our Managed Care.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, Juan.","Juan Vallarino","Hi, how you\u2019re doing? It\u2019s really more of the same. I assume they have very different approaches yet, if talking about our network the discussion back and forth, but I think for the foreseeable or next year it\u2019s going to be much more the same range of the guidance given contracts virtually the same couple of pilots in there.","Richard Bracken","I\u2019m going to remind you that we\u2019ve got about 85% to 90% of our 2012 managed care revenue currently under contract and at 5% to 6% sort of contracted rate increased zone with structures under those contracts very similar to what we\u2019ve been operating under in recent years. We got about half of our 2013 managed care revenue under contract and at same sort of rate growth range at this point, and again with underlying structures consistent.","So, although, there would be discussions, I think it especially gets closer to 2014, and assuming healthcare reforms continues to be on track and the like. But as of now, I would say our managed care pricing and our structures are similar to what -- and largely consistent with what we have been working with in recent years.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","If you could just help me square then the managed care pricing growth, I think you told us was 1.3% in the quarter on an equivalent admission basis, but the mix was down just only about 1%. So, may be just help us think a little bit more about that number in light of the pricing growth that you\u2019re talking about here?","Richard Bracken","So, Sam, I think in his comments addressed the primary reasons that our yield is below our contracted rate and it has to do with basically our surgical volumes in a few areas.","Sam Hazen","Let me just add to that for one minute. I think when we look at managed care activity and I want to give you some stats through the end of year as well as the fourth quarter, because I think it will help understand what changed in the fourth quarter and caused our trend to move from 4% or so down to 1.5% to 2%, and it really involves the fact that the book of business that grew and moved up to where we were basically flat with managed care admissions for the quarter is in the medical admission category.","We were up almost 3% in the fourth quarter on medical admissions. Year-to-date through September we were flat. Within medical admissions, the case mix and revenue per admission is almost 1.5 of surgical admissions.","And so when you look within surgical admissions, we were down less in the fourth quarter, not a whole lot, but less, we were down about 5% in the fourth quarter and through September year-to-date are down 5.5%. In the mix, in the combination of the weighting of the differences between revenue per medical admission patient versus the revenue per surgical admission starts to bring down the composite rate.","And obviously, we do okay on medical admissions, we do better on surgical admissions, but the weighting brings the overall composite revenue per adjusted admission to a number that below our contracted number. So, said another way, we just had movement in our book of business.","Within surgery we did see a little bit of a decline in the cardiovascular -- a large decline actually like I said in my comment in the neonatal. That contributed to some of it, but I think the mix of business here is also a significant contributing factor. I think Sam too the comp we had last year was a pretty high, that contributed to piece of it as well.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, Darren.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen And Company.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen And Company","Hi there, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you\u2019re beginning to see an increase in commercial volume. Could you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing and do you think that we\u2019ll see an improvement in the pricing metrics on the commercial side next year, kind of next quarter, first quarter or full year \u201812? And then could you give us the UPL numbers for this year, just for this quarter please?","Milton Johnson","Okay. This is Milton. Let me give you the trend here on our managed care adjusted admission growth for the year and this trend is encouraging relative to the 2012 outlook. Our managed care adjusted admission we had a decline of 0.6% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010. In the second quarter we were flat. In the third quarter we actually had growth. We grew 0.5% in managed care and other adjusted admission growth, that\u2019s the first quarter we have reflected growth in years and that\u2019s that.","And now, in the fourth quarter we were up 0.8% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2010. So each quarter this year a continuing improvement in the growth rate and so we\u2019re encouraged by that as we go into 2012.","Now with respect to the rates, we\u2019re going through this service mix shift that Sam just described very well relative to the yield that we\u2019re getting on that rate. I think we\u2019re going to see probably continued pressure on yields in the first quarter, but as we get further into 2012, I think we\u2019re going to see a stable -- we\u2019re seeing a stabilization now, we\u2019ve got a difficult comp in the first quarter of 2012 and after that we should start to see that stabilization resulting in more yield pull through closer to our contracted rate rather than what we\u2019re seeing now.","With respect to UPL, for the quarter we\u2019ve reported EBITDA from the UPL program in the fourth quarter of $48 million that compares to $86 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, $231 million of EBITDA UPL program versus $304 million in 2010. So, a $73 million decline for the year, $38 million for the quarter.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen And Company","On the managed care adjusted admissions, are you expecting that to be a positive turf in 2012?","Richard Bracken","Well, we\u2019re not giving guidance on details about payer on volume, again, but we are encouraged looking at the trend going into 2012, especially with some of the recent news around unemployment, that picture looking a little bit better as well.","Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen And Company","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, Christine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Looking at your really strong free cash flow and in fact you paid this special dividend. I\u2019m just curious how will you be thinking about that in the future be it additional dividends, be it share repurchases and kind of what was the criteria that really sets you up to do that dividend this quarter. So just some color there about how you think about the world going forward, particularly going into 2013?","Milton Johnson","Thank you, Frank. Richard, do you want to do that?","Richard Bracken","Yeah, obviously, the way we think about the special dividend, it\u2019s really a method of returning some liquidity to all of our shareholders. And without requiring them to reduce their ownership position and so this is really -- this makes a lot of sense given the interest rates and the generally lower industry valuation environment. We have said repeatedly that our strong cash position allows us to be very flexible in creating value and that\u2019s going to be our go forward strategy.","A strong cash flow allows us lots of choices you saw over 2011. We not only fully sourced our capital budgets, but we repurchased the shares from Bank of America 80 million shares. We\u2019ve completed key acquisitions and all these issues are -- we will evaluate as we go forward.","Strong cash flow gives us that positive set of choices and we\u2019ll continue to play that kind of discipline to where we can create value for the shareholders and still maintain our market position. And we\u2019ll be flexible and supple about that as we go forward.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks.","Richard Bracken","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital. Please go ahead.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","Good morning, gentlemen, and very nice job to everyone pulling out of a difficult second quarter into a much stronger second half. But you\u2019ve done it before, so I guess you pulled the rule book out and adopted it and you did a good job.","But I want to look forward a little bit, and while I don\u2019t want to dump any kind of cold water on what should be a very nice party today. I do need to ask about readmissions and that little lawsuit down in Florida, so not related, but I think two important things.","First of all, if I understand all of your strategies correctly from a quality of care point of view from an accuracy and process and clinical protocol point of view, I would understand you to already be working towards reducing unnecessary or avoidable readmissions. So, there\u2019s two questions about that. One, by how much more would your volumes be growing if you weren\u2019t avoiding those readmissions?","Two, how much more do you have to go? Three, what are you including in your guidance for fourth quarter of 2012 when the rules changed for payment? And then if you could tell us what the situation is with the lawsuit down in Florida? It\u2019s great, we appreciate it.","Richard Bracken","All right, Sheryl. I\u2019m going to bump, as you would expect, to Jon Perlin the readmission discussion. John is our Chief Medical Officer as you well know, make sure everybody else knows, but on the litigation, we have pretty standard policy over the years that we do not comment on pending litigation. So, I would like to leave it at that on that particular case at this point.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","Great.","Jon Perlin","Well, thanks Rick, in the area of readmission as you probably know, the initial CMS data have come out. They\u2019re tracking readmissions for heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia. And our data look pretty comfortable to the industry and in some instances better.","Obviously, it\u2019s an area where we want to make sure that patient care is integrated. it\u2019s an area tests us in terms of continuity care models and with the large number of employed providers, especially in the area of cardiovascular services, we have the opportunity to create longitudinal relationships, as well as with our voluntary medical staff.","So, it\u2019s an area where we see a good connection between the hospital-based services and non-hospital based services. And if there is any opportunity capacity created that would be one potential benefit, but we see this really an opportunity for good patient care across to continue.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I understand that and I think I understand the nuances there of connecting with the non-hospital base continuing, which seems to be the key because you can\u2019t control what happens after they\u2019re discharged, but what I\u2019m also trying to get at is, there seems to be for those hospital companies that perhaps have not been proactive in trying to improve the process and quality of care and reduce not only unnecessary readmissions, but also length of stay, there would be a difference between your already industry leading volume growth. In other words, if you weren\u2019t avoiding those readmissions, can you give me a sense or will you be able to give us a sense at some point as to how much you are leaving on the table?","Sam Hazen","Sheryl, this is Sam Hazen. I think just to add to what John said and it\u2019s through our analysis and our programs and other efforts, at this particular point in time we\u2019re viewing readmission as an immaterial risk to sort of our volume metrics at this particular point in time.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","Okay. All right. That\u2019s great. I think I get that. Could you just explain the big tax item in the cash flow this year and how much you\u2019re looking for cash flow from operations for next year?","Richard Bracken","Sure, Milton?","Milton Johnson","Yeah, with respect to tax item, we settled a couple of tax cases closed out a couple of years and we picked up about $172 million in refunds related to those years. So, now I believe we have all of our tax years closed through 2004.","And so we\u2019re very pleased to get those settled and agreed to we think in terms of reasonable. So, we did pick up a refund. Of course, that should not reoccur. Also, this year and into fourth quarter we benefited from accelerated depreciation with some of the tax law changes as a result of the recession, so able to expense for tax faster than we are writing off or depreciating the book. That certainly helped our effective tax rate as well during the year.","Of course, that will work against us the future period. As far as the our cash flow from ops going forward, of course, another thing benefited this year, it was the HITECH incentive payment, it also was a benefit to our cash this year.","So, going forward I would say that our cash flow operations for next year would range probably around $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion framed around the same range of our EBITDA target that we\u2019ve given.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","I think I\u2019m just going to quit my job and go buy HCA\u2019s stocks and bonds because you guys keep returning lots of value to shareholders, so thank you.","Richard Bracken","Thank you, Sheryl.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good morning, good quarter. The question I just wanted to focus on was as you think about the fourth quarter of 2012, a couple moving parts, one I think I\u2019m understanding that unless the Texas Medicaid waiver has extended, there\u2019s some risk to the continuing UPL benefit and I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t clear exactly maybe what you are assuming for the year?","And then the second part of the question for the fourth quarter is obviously there\u2019s a pretty wide range of potential outcomes on the Medicare update given the MS-DRG coding add back and the potential for some other coding callback et cetera those two items almost net each other off in my mind in the dollar fashion for 4Q, but I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s your range of expectations were for those two items?","Richard Bracken","I think on the Medicare side Gary all we\u2019re doing -- we\u2019re projecting current law. Obviously there will be inpatient update you want to have you that will be a with, but at this point our expectations and estimates are based on current law. In terms of UPL, I know Mil you talked a little about the down graph that we expect and it relates, I don\u2019t know so much of fourth quarter, it relates to the full year.","Milton Johnson","It relates to the full year about probably $80 million to $90 million of additional drop in EBITDA from UPL program for 2012 versus 2011. Of course, like I said, we did have a $73 million decline in 2011 versus 2010. We\u2019ve just used our best information.","There\u2019s still some uncertainty and details we don\u2019t know about the new waiver and how it\u2019s going to play out in some of our markets, but we\u2019ve used our best information, our best estimate to come up with the guidance that we\u2019re giving on UPL for 2012, but there is certainly still some moving parts.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Am I right that that waiver would have to get extended again to preserve even that diminished level of funding? Is it a waiver for one-year? Am I right?","Milton Johnson","Its five years.","Richard Bracken","Gary, it\u2019s a five-year waiver, I mean there could be adjustments in how the waiver is implemented clearly during that five-year period. So, it\u2019s a five-year wavier.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","","Great.","Richard Bracken","Gary, Thanks.","Vic Campbell","We\u2019ve got time for one last question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard","And thank you for letting me slip into the wire there back\u2026","Richard Bracken","(Inaudible) I wouldn\u2019t have let you through.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard","So much for old friend, I guess. Any way, just really two follow-ups, One, you pointed to the neonatal trends there Sam earlier. I was curious what sort of volatility do you normally see in that business? Can you point anything that\u2019s maybe unique now or is it explainable? I think Gary, just sort of touching on the Washington environment and some of the variables, I know you\u2019re particularly active there Vic. Any color that you all can offer in terms of what you are hearing and what might out on specific initiatives that are on the table right one?","Richard Bracken","One thing that\u2019s happened within our neonatal businesses is the clinical initiatives that we put towards many years ago and I think HCA has some credit externally around 39-week policies and so forth and that has had some impact on our neonatal unit.","The other thing that we\u2019ve seen across the market is, infertility volumes through infertility clinics had been down during the recession, which makes sense to me at a certain level and that does have some implication on multiple birth and how it plays out in the neonatal setting. Outside of that, we\u2019re really not seeing anything material that we can point to with neonatal activity across the company.","So, those are just some high level observations that we think have had some impact. Again, the fourth quarter was dramatically different in the first nine months of the year, so I\u2019m not necessarily focusing in on that as any kind of significant trend change. It\u2019s just that component of the explanation for this quarter.","Vic Campbell","And, Tom, this is Vic. On Washington, you know, probably as much as I know. Right now, clearly, we have got a Doc Fix Bill that goes through at the end of February. I think the general thinking is, it gets extended for 10 months through the end of the year and the payfors that are being discussed are the same payfors that were out there at the end of last year, last year they were talking about a two-year fix versus 10-month. There are some.","However, they would like to fix this and resolve it in its entirety, and there is a good bit of discussion about the OCF funds possibly being use there, but there are lot of folks who would like to use those funds as well. So, your guess is as good as mine.","Again, looking at the Doc Fix Bill, it\u2019s not a terribly material amount of money they have to come up with if they have to deal with it on a 10-monht basis. Outside of that particularly piece, I don\u2019t think much happening in healthcare legislation this year, it\u2019s more of an election year.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard","","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Bracken","All right. With that I want to thank everybody for being on the call. Mark and I are here all day. So look forward to see and talking to many of you. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That will conclude today\u2019s presentation. We appreciate your attendance. You may now disconnect."],"10865":["HCA Holdings, Inc.

Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income of attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release.","As you heard, the call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later today.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone for joining us on the call or on the webcast. I hope each of you has had the chance to review the release issued this morning, which is fairly consistent with the company's preview for the fourth quarter issued on January 9. I'll discuss the year and few other items, and turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide additional details on the quarter, health reform and 2015 guidance.","We are extremely pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2014. The fourth quarter performance was highlighted by strong volume metrics, favorable payer mix and excellent cost management. As a result, we produced revenue growth of 9.1%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.1% and diluted EPS growth of 29.3% over the prior year's fourth quarter.","Earnings per diluted share, excluding the gains and losses on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, increased 44.6% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, revenues totaled $36.9 billion compared to $34.2 billion last year, an increase of 8% compared to $6.574 billion in 2013.","Diluted earnings per share increased to $4.16 compared to $3.37 per share last year, an increase of 23.4%. EPS per diluted share, excluding gains and losses on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims cost, increased to $4.70 compared to $3.41 per share last year, an increase of 37.8%. Our results clearly exceeded our internal expectations for 2014.","One of our key strength is our ability to create shareholder value through capital deployment. For the full year 2014, we generated $4.45 billion of cash flows from operating activities, up 20.9% over 2013. We reported approximately $2.2 billion in capital spending in our existing markets in 2014, and we acquired three hospitals and a number of non-hospital healthcare related entities for approximately $770 million.","These investments revolve in their access points and enhance our service capabilities in our markets. Additionally, we repurchased 28.6 million shares of our stock for $1.75 billion in 2014, and today we announce the authorization of a new 1 billion share repurchase program.","With respect to our commitment to quality of care and patient safety, during the fourth quarter 85% of the company hospitals reporting core measure performance data were recognized as top performance by The Joint Commission. Recognizing that we will increasingly be measured and reimbursed based on the quality and value of our services, improvement in patient outcome and patient service will be our top priority in 2015.","As a part of this emphasis, we recently hired our first Chief Patient Experience Officer, who will be responsible for servicing best practices that have been developed across 88 hospitals, as well as other healthcare providers to ensure our patients have the best hospital experience.","Our efforts to improve quality and service are not only important to our patients, but also to all of our caregivers and the employees that want to align the top quality organizations and pay our employers for receiving greater value. We believe our operating strategies are highly effective and resource appropriately for 2015.","In addition to our robust clinical agenda, we will continue to develop local market networks for convenience and access, quality and deep service capabilities and position alignment. A great example of improving convenience and access is our recently announced acquisition of CareNow, which operates 24 urgent care centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, with approximately 850,000 patient visits per year.","Now, moving to health reform. We are pleased with our 2014 growth from healthcare reform, which largely resulted from our approach to exchange contracting. For 2015, we remain disciplined with our pricing strategy and we have broadened our network participation in many of our large markets. For example, we have increased our health exchange contracts by 37% over 2014. Bill will provide additional information on health reform in just a few minutes.","And in closing, I must congratulate Sam Hazen on his appointment to HCA's Chief Operating Officer. As many of you know, Sam has served in a number of executive roles during his 32-year career at HCA, most recently as President of Operations. I have worked closely with Sam for many years, and I appreciate his commitment to achieving ever-improving operational performance that supports the best clinical outcomes for our patients.","As HCA continues to evolve its strategies in areas of clinical quality and physician engagement, a number of roles in the company have increased in significance and responsibilities. As a result, we have promoted four HCA executives to HCA's senior management team.","These promotions not only are well-deserved, but I believe they enhanced our ability to achieve ever-increasing higher clinical performance and meet the many objectives we have, as an industry-leading organization. And finally, we are excited by the inclusion of HCA in S&P 500 indices, starting from January 26. We are happy to be part of this group.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everybody. I will cover some additional information relating the fourth quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on operations, then I'll come back and discuss health reform detail and finish with the discussions surrounding our 2015 earnings guidance.","Once again, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results. Fourth quarter volume trends were some of the best we've experienced in a number of years. This coupled with good payer mix and service mix and excellent expense management, combined to drive the quarter's and the year's strong performance.","For the quarter adjusted EBITDA, as reported, increased 14.1% to $1.956 billion from $1.714 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 90 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.3%.","During the fourth quarter we recorded a $68 million increase in Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, a reverse reduction made in the third quarter. As a reminder, we made an adjustment in third quarter to reduce Medicaid revenues due to some uncertainty caused by the CMS inquiry of the Texas Medicaid Program and the payment deferral that was issued.","During the fourth quarter the company received approximately $161 million related to our outstanding receivables in CMS looking the deferral they had previously issued. So these events gave us really the long assurance regarding recognized Medicaid revenues associated with the Texas Medicaid fiscal year ending September 30, 2014. And thus, the $68 million adjustment was made in the fourth quarter.","However, we understand, CMS continues to inquire in certain aspects of the program on a go-forward basis. As a result, the company reduced its Medicaid revenues by approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter and we expect to reduce Medicaid revenues by approximately $70 million in 2015, well prepared to what we recognized during the course of 2014.","We will continue to monitor developments relating to this program and update you on any material changes. Adjusting for the impacts of these items as well as EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 14.4% over the prior year for the quarter.","In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 5% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 5.6%. Sam will provide more color on the composition of this volume in a moment.","During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11.7% on same facility basis and represent 31% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 9.1% and 12.7% respectively in the quarter, consistent with the trends we experienced in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in our five expansion states, but also have seen growth in our non-expansion states as well. I will provide additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform remarks.","Same facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 8.8% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions declined 4.6%. These represent 7.2% of our total admissions compared to 8.3% last year and has continued to turn favorable for the company. Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions increased 5.3% and equivalent admissions increased 5.6% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.","Same-facility emergency room visits increased 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility, self-pay and charity ER visits represent a 19.7% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 23.2% last year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 0.7% comparing to the prior year period. Same-facility surgical volumes increased 0.6% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 2.4% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.3% from the prior year.","Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.5% in the quarter. Same-facility managed care and other, which includes exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3% in the quarter. Consistent with our third quarter results, case mix increased 1.9% compared to the prior year.","Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $238 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $897 million, a decline of $18 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.39 billion, an increase of $256 million over the prior year.","Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of services. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter.","Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue improved by 50 basis points to 44.4% compared to 44.9% in last year's fourth quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% in the quarter on a same-facility basis leveraging our strong volume in the quarter.","Supply expense per equivalent admission was flat for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 50 basis points as a percent of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives.","Other operating expenses improved 10 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.5% of revenues. We recognized $28 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $50 million last year. Consistent with our expectations, we incurred approximately $16 million in electronic health expenses in the quarter compared to $28 million last year.","As previously mentioned our as reported adjusted EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points over the prior year. Adjusting for Texas Waiver items, high tech income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 100 basis points over prior year for the quarter.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another extremely strong quarter, with cash flow from operations increasing to $1.627 billion, 33% above last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.1 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. For full year 2014, cash flow from operations was $4.45 billion and free cash flows were just over $1.8 billion.","So that concludes my remarks on 2014. I'd like to turn the call over to Sam to give some additional detail for the quarter, and I'll come back and discuss health reform and our 2015 guidance.","Samuel Hazen","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous three quarters of the year. We believe this performance reflects a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda, our operating teams, improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets, and capital spending that has been invested both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity.","There were some additional factors that contributed to the quarter's accelerating growth. First, we had a return to normal seasonality trend. Typically, fourth quarter volumes trends are over the third quarter by approximately 1.5%. In 2013, this did not happen, which created a favorable comparison for 2014.","Secondly, admissions with the flu-related diagnosis were up 77%, which drove approximately 40 basis points of our overall growth. And finally, the anniversary of the CMS 2-Midnight Rule occurred in this quarter. These factors overlap somewhat, but I wanted to highlight them.","Growth in volume was broad-based across most of the company's market and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter, all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, both in adjusted admissions and growth in emergency room visits. All but one of our divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions and adjusted admissions.","All divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. All of our divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries and 10 had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries. Most of them had some level of surgical growth with notable growth in orthopedics, vascular and general surgery services.","Our Ambulatory Surgery Division had continued softness in the quarter. Surgeries were down 2.6%. Deliveries for the quarter were up 3.7%, with 10 divisions showing growth. Managed care and exchange deliveries were up almost 11%. All divisions had growth in these payer classes.","Other categories of our business were strong also. Neonatal admissions grew 9.5%. Behavioral health admissions were up 9%. Rehab admissions were up 9.7%. And finally, average length of stay grew about 0.9%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions.","Market share trends for the company for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2014, are generally consistent with past trends. Market share grew by 10 basis points to slightly above 24%, with approximately 60% of our markets increasing share across most of the service line categories.","Of particular note is the rebound in overall inpatient demand, which increased in the second quarter across HCA's markets by slightly over 1%. Commercial demand was even more notable, with an increase of 3.5%. Demand in the prior two quarters of this 12 month period was down.","HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving results. We continue to invest in it at appropriate levels. In 2015, we will be increasing our capital expenditures to around $2.4 billion. This increase will provide more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity and add equipment for our nurses and sergeants.","In certain markets, the capital spending will be deployed through new hospitals and new outpatient facilities. In addition to the increasing capital spending, we are making investments in other aspects of our business and will require additional operating expenses in 2015. We believe these investments are strategic and will have a positive impact for the company in the future.","The three months prominent investments are in the following areas. First, the company is implementing a new human resource model, we call it oneHR, that will leverage the company's scale and consolidate certain administrative functions, such as recruiting and training. Once implemented, we believe this effort will enhance our workforce and help our facilities deliver better care more efficiently.","The second area is related to our information systems. The company is making additional investments for information system that we believe will provide a better user experience for our physicians. Additionally, we expect these investments will create more robust clinical data that we can leverage across our business to improve quality, increase efficiencies and drive growth.","And finally, the company is making an investment to implement the new ICD-10 coding requirements, which go into effect later this year. These operational initiatives plus a few smaller ones represent approximately $100 million in additional cost in 2015.","With that, let me turn the call back to Bill.","William Rutherford","Thanks, Sam. So now, let me move into a discussion about health reform and our 2015 guidance. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we saw just over 7,700 exchange admissions and about 26,000 exchange ER visits. This is about equal to our third quarter exchange volumes and fell in line with our expectations that exchange growth will level out in the second half of the year.","Our trends in Medicaid expansion states continued into the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Medicaid admissions were up 51% and uninsured admissions were down 65% in expansion states. For full year 2014, Medicaid admissions and expansion states increased 40% and uninsured admissions were down 58%.","In non-expansion states, Medicaid admissions increased 3.3% and uninsured admissions declined 1.6% over prior-year's fourth quarter. For the year, Medicaid admissions increased 2.4% and uninsured admissions declined 3.4% in our non-expansion states. With only five states expanding Medicaid bill, the vast majority of reform benefit is still coming from the exchange activity.","The percentage of our exchange volume that was previously uninsured came down a bit in the fourth quarter. And now year-to-date, based on our look-back, we estimate about 42% of exchange volume were newly insured for 2014. When we rollup all aspects in reform, we estimate health reform contributed about 4.5% of adjusted EBITDA growth for us in 2014, and that's when you compare it to our 2013 adjusted EBITDA.","As we think about modeling, the 2015 reform benefit demonstrate there remain several variables that impact our assumptions and guidance and including final enrollment, the percentage of newly insured for the new enrolled lives, utilization trends and the impact of changing networks.","With all of these variables, we are currently estimating our reform benefit to increase approximately 60% to 70% from 2014 levels and represents 2% to 3% of incremental EBITDA growth over 2014, as reported EBITDA. As a result, we estimate about 6% to 7% of our 2015 adjusted EBITDA will be related to the benefits of health reform.","Remember, these are benefits from increased coverage of the uninsured and are not being offset for these purposes by the [indiscernible] reimbursement cuts to our annual CMS updates that we all experienced.","Our assumption on reform, in essence, starts with our current run rate and inflates for a growth factor that's principally keen on projected increases in total enrollment in exchanges, keeping our current experience for the assumption of newly insured about the same as 2014 and impact during a ramp up of utilization, similar to what we experienced this year.","There were a few other variables impacting our reform estimate, but we look at our growth principally by annualizing our current run rate and increasing for new enrollment activity. There still remain some unknown variables that may impact the reform benefit. So for now, this is our guidance going into 2015. And consistent with our practices in 2014, our plan is to continue to update you on our experience, giving material changes in our thinking in conjunction with reporting our quarterly results.","Looking ahead for this year and our 2015 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2015 consolidated revenue should range from $38.5 billion to $39.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.35 billion and $7.65 billion.","So let me walk you through how we think about our guidance. First, as a management team, we view 2014, on all accounts as an outstanding year, one of our best years ever. We were benefited not only by strong organic growth in health reform, but also a couple of non-recurring adjustments, and we highlighted these items within our release this morning.","Between the Texas waiver adjustments and RAC settlements alone, we recognized about $300 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2014 that we are not projecting to reoccur in 2015. In addition, as anticipated, at around four year vesting schedule, our non-cash share-based compensation expense is projected to increase about $60 million in 2015.","Lastly is the continued step-down of our HITECH incentive income of about $80 million. We are also indicating a decline of HITECH expenses and approximately $70 million of these costs remain in the company to continue to support electronic health vendors and other ongoing automation efforts.","Going forward, these costs are no longer being classified as HITECH expenses, but they remain in the system. So when you adjust for these items, the $300 million of non-recurring adjustments, share-based comp and HITECH income declines. The midpoint of our guidance reflects about 7.2% growth over 2014, which includes the 2% to 3% reform benefit, leading our core business growth between 4.5% and 5%.","Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 4% for 2015. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admissions to reflect the composite growth rate of about 1%, factoring in market basket changes and offer reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases.","Medicaid revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated being mostly flat year-over-year, excluding the declines of Texas Medicaid waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%.","Operating expenses are anticipated to continue to benefit from the continued low inflationary environment, and we are estimating large improvements to range between 20 basis points and 50 basis points on a normalized basis. We anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.4 billion in 2015.","We estimate depreciation and amortization to be just under $1.9 billion and interest expense to be about $1.7 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be about 38%. And lastly, our average shares are projected to be approximately 442 million share and earnings per share guidance for 2015 is between $4.55 and $4.95.","So that concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Vic for some Q&A.","Victor Campbell","Bill, thank you. So now if you could jump back on and poll for questions. And we would encourage each of you to limit your questions to just one, because we have quite a number of folks on the line today and we'll give everybody a chance.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Josh Raskin","So I appreciate you guys delineating the EBITDA growth. And I guess if I look at it now that sort of core growth, that you guys are talking about, the 4.5% to 5%, that actually screen toward the higher-end of, I guess, your 3% to 5% long-term organic growth. So is that just economic recovery? Does that include some of the outpatient growth and acquisitions that you guys are seeing? It didn't sound like the volume growth is necessarily can be way above historical. So I'm just curious, why you guys are more comfortable at that higher-end of the organic growth rate?","Milton Johnson","I'll start up with that and then Bill and Sam maybe want to add some comments. Yes, it is at the higher-end of our 3% to 5% growth that we have been stating for a number of years now, which we expect certain years to obviously do a little bit better, maybe other years a little bit less, but we think that's a reasonable zone. And we did guide to the high-end of that range this year.","Now, I think it's reflective of our marketplace, as you know, the capital that we're spending, we've increased our capital spend over the last couple of years. Again, we're seeing a macroeconomic improvement in many of our markets. We've talked about that over the last several months.","We're seeing our volume in that 2% to 3% range that we're guiding, coming off of year we were 2.9% this year for the year. So we think all those things, the acquisitions we've made and some of the tuck-in acquisitions, the acquisition of CareNow, all those things providing us to I think come in a core growth near the top or at the top of our 3% to 5% expectation.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake","So I wanted to dig in on the reform guidance for a minute. Specifically, can you walk us through the run rate coming out of the fourth quarter? And maybe also can you give us a ballpark estimate for the reform benefits in Q1 through Q3, just so we understand the run rate versus the new growth? And then I had one quick numbers question.","Victor Campbell","Bill, that's all yours.","William Rutherford","Let me try to walk you through it and do the best I can on it and I'll try to lay out some detail on the commentary. As I look at reform, we said it contributed about 4.5% of our growth in 2014. That clearly ramps in the second half of the year, leveled out to Q3 and Q4. So a little bit higher towards the backend of that number you can estimate.","As we think about watching our reform, 2014 we saw a ramp up of volume, low in Q1, ramps through our Q2, and really leveled out in Q3 and Q4. So a simple way we look at our estimate is, first, by annualizing our Q4 run rate, and that utilization makes up about half of our increase alone.","And then we're estimating the new enrollment numbers on top of that. And I know we're all keeping an eye on this. We're roughly keying off HHS total enrollment projection of around 10 million, up from 7 million or so in 2014. That's obviously nationally, so we did try to make some assumptions and distract enrollments trends in our markets. So keying off this, we potentially might see a 40% to 50% increase in total enrollment.","We don't expect to see that kind of volume increase day one, so we're back to our assumption on volume ramping through Q1 and Q2, and with this we might see an expected increase, let's say, 30% to 35% on top of our Q4 run rate. So, yes, a large portion of that growth will be weighted towards Q1 and Q2, and then you might see that 30% or so growth overall run rates for the Q3 and Q4.","So year-on-year growth is probably a little bit between the first quarter and second quarter. And half of it is coming from or half of the growth is coming from the utilization effect and the other half coming from our assumption around increased enrollment.","Victor Campbell","Justin you had one numbers question, you wanted to ask.","Justin Lake","If you could give us cash flow from operations and minority interest numbers, that will be great.","William Rutherford","I think cash flow from ops would be in a range of between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. And I don't have minority interest handy [indiscernible]. I'll get to you, Justin.","Operator","And we'll go next to A. J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice","I guess I'll just ask about Texas Medicaid waiver and your assumptions there. So you recognized, say, about $70 million in 2014, but it sound like for the last two quarters of the year you were getting about $34 million to $35 million a quarter. I guess what is the run rate that you would say if you get these approvals that you'd see it in '15? And it sounds like there is some indication that you're going to get something, you just haven't pinned down exactly what the amount is. Can you just confirm that and give us some flavor more or detail, as to what you're actually looking to see?","Milton Johnson","I know there are a lot of moving parts to this, so let me try to walk you through and simplify as best I can. In the third quarter, due to inquiry and payment deferral, we reduced the Medicaid revenues and our related expected receivables that we have previously recorded, due to that uncertainty. The Medicaid program is on a 10-month fiscal year, so our adjustments we booked in the third quarter really related to the September 30, 2014, yearend in what we have previously recorded.","As I mentioned, based on the activity we saw on the fourth quarter, the $161 million payment [indiscernible] related to the '14 fiscal year gave us confidence in restoring our estimate for that program here. So what we're really talking about is reducing our revenue recognition for the program years in 2015 and potentially even 2016, depending on how the inquiry unfolds.","And so the reduced revenue is about $35 million in the fourth quarter and the effective reduce in our revenue recognition year-over-year is about $70 million from 2015. So how I would think about it is, majority of that reduction that we're recognizing between '15 and '14 is because of some uncertainty around the inquiry on a go-forward basis.","We hope to have some insight and maybe even clarity on the extent of that inquiry going forward and will adjust that as necessary, but in essence what we're doing is reducing our revenue curve going forward in light of some of those ongoing inquiries going forward. So I think $70 million is the number used year-over-year, and if that returns favorably, then we'll re-examine revenue that we should record going through the '15 year.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Just want to follow up on the exchange benefit. I guess the math that you laid out makes some sense. Although, I think that Bill could have made it a little bit faster. It just feels conservative. Where does the 37% increase of exchange contracts fit into that analysis? I would think that should be additive. Or is there some offset on pricing or something else that we should be thinking about?","Milton Johnson","It is. And Kevin, as I tried to mentioned, there is a lot of variables that go into it. We try to simplify, just taking our run rate up by a level, and clearly we're factoring it in kind of new contracts, potentially new access. There is also other factors that we talked about in the past, some potential current yield declines or payment declines, as you participate in some of those networks to slight degree, some in fact are Medicaid expansions.","So we've factored all of those variables into our estimate. We're trying to just characterize by the run rate plus enrollment. But it is being adjusted for both, the increased network participation and offset a little bit by some yield differentials in payments for the previously insured commercial product as compared to exchange product.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker","Just following up once again on the exchange math here. I do appreciate commentary on the 40% to 50% increase in enrollment, but last couple of quarters you guys talked about your expectations to increase your yield and converting your uninsured over to exchange rates and expenses in '14. Maybe if you could just touch upon how your experience is with those populations progress? And any expectations, the uninsured may deviate in a positive way for you guys from versus maybe national expectations?","Milton Johnson","Andrew, we key off really what our current experience is and as we talked through before what we do is look back at exchange patients level we've seen this year, look back how we've previously seen them and what was their status when we saw them. And that's what we're coming up with our estimate of about 42% on a yearly basis of the patients we saw in exchanges who are newly insured.","We're clearly keeping tack of various reports that are out there about year or two. And one of the key variables will be -- is the new large in year two really be similar on a percentage newly insured, can they potentially be greater than the numbers in year one. And we know that's a variable. But our assumption right now is based on the best experience we have, which is what we're actually seeing.","As a corollary, maybe related to your question, we are making outreach efforts within our communities to help people explore gaining access to coverage. And as we did talk about I think on our last quarter's call, we stepped up our efforts this year as compared to what we were doing last year. We've partnered with several national agencies. We've made a lot of outbound efforts in terms of e-mail, letters, even personal contact, helping people register within community events, and helping people explore access to coverage and made it available to them either through expanded Medicaid or health insurance changes.","I characterize those efforts as much better than we've had in year one. We sometimes lose visibility in how much of those actually yielded in enrollment, but the patients that were new were very, very impressed that we were able to have some traction on the communities and for our previously uninsured patients that we serve.","So we probably know this is a variable keeping track of. If it turns out national enrollment is more favorable than that, then our experienced kind of yields that. Then I would hope our advantage is greater, but right now we're going on the assumption base than based on our actual experience.","Operator","And we'll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich","My question is in the context of Secretary Burwell announcing last week on HHS', obviously setting some I guess medium-term goals on alternative payment models. And I was just hoping you could update us on where HCA is in terms of time, quality to payments and if there is a way to quantify now how much your revenue is contracted and any kind of alternative payment models beyond just the street fee-for service?","Samuel Hazen","Milton, you want to take that?","Milton Johnson","Of course, Darren, we've been dealing with some paper performance elements in our Medicare reimbursement. Now, for the last few years, we do well with that. Of course, that's a small percentage of the overall Medicare revenue. In our managed care contracts, many of our managed care have paper performance and those contracts typically impacts the amount of the annual increase, it maybe a 0.5% or a certain amount of the increased subject to achieving certain performance metrics. And again, we perform well with those metrics.","When I talk about the bigger picture, the value in healthcare, and I mentioned this in my opening comments, we realize that with changes in healthcare, increasing consumers in the healthcare that we need to provide greater quality in service and value.","And so if you look at our agenda around quality, our agenda around patient service, our ability to deliver care efficiently, our facilities, the investments we're making in technology, all these things, clinical excellence, all these things I think are reflective of an organization that's focused on improving the outcomes and service to our patients and therefore providing more value for the healthcare dollar.","So I feel very comfortable that we're making the right investments to be able to operate effectively in an environment where it's, say, more value-based, based on quality outcomes and delivering value to the patients or to the payers or to the employers.","Today not a lot of our revenue quite frankly is subject to that. Again, it's implemental in certain contracts. But we are preparing the organization to be able to perform in that environment, if we see the marketplace change. Number one, it's good business, it's what we should be focused on, quality and service to the patients, as I said is our number one priority and it will continue to be in the foreseeable future.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman","I guess maybe could you talk about your view on additional states expanding Medicaid. Is any of that factored into your guidance? And I guess which states you're most optimistic about potentially participating what the benefit might be?","Milton Johnson","In terms of factoring into guidance, we are only including the states that have expanded Medicaid. So we're not making the guess on where others are. We do have a small physician in Indiana and it appears that Indiana is moving forward, so that's very good moves.","Here in Tennessee you're probably all aware that a special session of the legislature began last night. Governor Haslam is working very, very hard and many are working with him to try to help our state legislatures understand how important this is to the state of Tennessee and benefits that would accrue to many across states. So we're hopeful and reasonably optimistically hope that that can get passed here early, but we have not put any of that into our numbers. We'll obviously continue to watch other states and be supportive where we can be.","Gary Lieberman","Any view on Florida specifically of what might happen there?","Milton Johnson","Probably your view is good as mine. There are some who support it and some who don't and we don't necessarily think it happened this year, but your guess again would be as good as mine.","Operator","Now we'll go to next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe","Capital deployment back to shareholders in the form of repurchase and even dividend at times has certainly been strong. I guess the question is where do you sit with M&A? Do you see longer assets emerging, is valuation perhaps centering deals? And I guess what's the outlook and pipeline for maybe larger system consolidation?","Milton Johnson","Well, as I have said for the last several years, we're interested in the opportunity to grow through acquisitions have the right market dynamics, and recourse with the right pricing discipline. Quite frankly we haven't seen a lot of opportunities, what I call needle-moving opportunities. We've had a few, and in many cases, the seller decided not to pursue other transactions.","So we remain hopeful that we'll see some good opportunities. But as I've said many times in the past if we don't have the opportunities to grow through acquisitions, we'll continue to invest in our existing markets and see our capital spend increase for 2015, up to about $2.4 billion. We have opportunities to grow organically. We've been doing that in recent years. We'll continue to do that.","We're fortunate to have markets that are growing. We're seeing some improvement in demand for services. And again, with our growth strategies, we feel confident we can continue to have solid organic growth as expressed in our guidance for this year.","Also, with our strong cash flows, as Bill mentioned, we do have the opportunity to return cash to shareholders on a regular basis. Most recently, we've been doing that with share repurchases the $1.75 billion that we accomplished in '14, and this morning announcing another $1 billion share repurchase.","So we've had a very diverse capital deployment strategy since coming back into the public market in 2011. And we will continue to do that. We try to continue to take advantage of the opportunities that the market presents. And use our balance sheet, the good position we have on our balance sheet appropriately to increase shareholder value.","William Rutherford","If I could add one thing to that, we have been fairly active in outpatient acquisitions and other type of facility acquisitions that complement our networks within each of our markets and we'll continue to be opportunistic in that particular area, because it's very accretive to the local market and it creates better platform for our provider systems locally. And no, that opportunities are not material in and of themselves, but they do add value over time and create different relationships with patients and different relationships with physicians.","Operator","Now, we'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Most of mine have been answered, but I guess I've got one here for Bill going back to the guidance. I know there are a couple of things that I kind of picked up on, that might be upside. But from your perspective, where do you see the biggest wiggle room, the biggest drivers to either getting the high end of your range or maybe even exceeding it?","William Rutherford","I'll try not to walk into something. I think we tried to walkthrough really some of the moving parts that we have prepared for '15 and '14. And that puts us, as I think mentioned before, at high end of our traditional range of 3% to 5%, perhaps a little bit lower than what we posted in the past year or so.","So reform, clearly, I would tell you there is still remain variables on reform. It turned out better throughout 2014, and we anticipate it going into 2014, but there's so many variables that go into it. It's our operational trends, volumes and rates as well as how some of these kind of moving parts unfold on us. And I think there is more probably right now has some of the most variability to it.","Operator","Now, we'll go next to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Just a follow-up on Frank's question and to your answer to that one, Bill. At your Medicaid expansion state ER visits for the uninsured, what's the trend that you're seeing so far? Are you still seeing improvements throughout, that where we ended in Q4?","William Rutherford","Yes. So in our expansion states, it's leveled off. We saw the majority of the benefit in the third quarter in the state. The uninsured declines in our expansion states are still in that 60% level, so we're kind of leveled off at that. So I'd say they have found their level right now. I think that's contributed significantly to the company's overall uninsured trends.","And I'm not so sure what we'll see in a year two in those expansion states in terms of the year-over-year growth. I think there is probably still some more room for uninsured to gain access to coverage in year two in those expansion states. Clearly it won't be as dramatic as we experienced this year.","So I think for the most part, it probably found its level. We seem to be in the fourth quarter about where we were in third quarter. So we might see some incremental benefit going into the year with more uninsured gain couch in those expansion states, but its still 60% to 65% decline that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Now, we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Rigg","This is kind of a follow-up to the last question, but historically the industry has talked about frequent flayers and more population representing kind of a disproportionally high level of the bad debt. I guess, particularly in the Medicaid expansion states, but also among those that you presume to be newly covered or under commercial subsidiaries, have you seen any behavioral changes from the population? Have they come into the ER less or anything notable to highlight would be great.","William Rutherford","The remaining uninsured, I can't say I've seen anything different in their behavior. We have identified that cliff, and our outbound efforts this year were trying to help people, in that situation understand access and availability that walk in for coverage. But I don't think we've seen any change in their behavior.","Samuel Hazen","Let me add one thing to that. On the Medicaid side, I think that's entirely the case. We haven't really seen a significant change in Medicaid activity and behavior. So the emergency room heavily, they struggle to get access to physicians in some markets. So that dynamic still exists.","On the uninsured, who have gained access to commercial insurance products, we have seen less utilization of the emergency room and more availability to other facility opportunities or physician opportunities. And that's been slight, but significant enough for us to notice that when they do get commercial insurance, there is different ability to access care through physician office or possibly through urgent care centers and the like and not through the emergency room.","So that has been noticeable. Is it material yet? No. Could it possible develop over time? And again, that's part of the reason we are looking at other alternative facility acquisitions and development in urgent care and so forth, so that we're prepared for that dynamic, if in fact it does occur.","Operator","Now, we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte","So just could you give a little bit more color on the volumes trends and what you're assuming in your guidance for 2015? Specifically, on the HCA, with the existing enrollment that you have, what types of volume assumptions have you made with regard to the surgeries and procedures and so on depending on the health risk you've seen. Any color on the economy as far as what you're assuming on either changing trends or unemployment? And then finally on, any shifts you might have seen on Ebola and the flu that I think you 40 bps, what is the assumption being made for the '15 guidance?","William Rutherford","Let me try to address the first part. As we mentioned, our overall volume guidance is 2% to 3% of equivalent admission growth for the year. You asked specifically around health reform volume contribution to that, we alluded to kind of our health reform build to 50% to 60% year-over-year, a little bit north of that. That is reflecting equalization of the growth, principally in the Q1 and Q2 time, and then anticipating on an average basis about 30% to 35% growth in enrollment. So that has helped fueling some of our increased volume growth for the company. Sam, I'll let you comment on the economic.","Samuel Hazen","I think if you do short circuit, the volume assumptions at the company had build into its 2015 play and its 2015 guidance. It's really on the particular point. First is that we do think that the market play is going to revert back to sort of normal demand growth. In some of that is the macroeconomic picture, but some of it is normalized activity with respective flus and so forth as we've seen from one quarter to the other. So that's going to generate we think, somewhat between the half of point of growth in overall demand.","And then if you look at our market share trends, over the past 24 to 36 months, we've tended to pick up 20 basis points to 25 basis points in market share maybe as a good metric over time. So when you put that together, it puts us in the range of our volume guidance.","We have numerous initiatives that should drive growth into marketplace, and Milton touched on them, it revolves around creating sufficient access points to our networks, so that patients can find it convenient to enter into an HCA network. So we have significant investments in additional outpatient access points. In 2015, that will hit the marketplace.","Additionally, we are making sure that our networks within each of our markets have a comprehensive array of service line, so that they can take care of a patient, if needed within any particular service line somewhere within our network. Again, we're adding capability there with different kind of service line offering there both deeper income statement and broader in others.","And then the third piece is related to our physician strategy, when we're working with our physicians to add physicians to our medical staff or to create better alignment through different technologies and different relationships and so forth, and that we believe is rounding out the growth strategy. So if you underpin that with more capital going into the market, we think those are the basic elements that will continue to support market share gains and industry-leading growth.","Victor Campbell","We're closing in on the hour, so one last question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary Taylor","I didn't hear you say much about Texas and maybe I missed that earlier, but just maybe some thoughts on anything you've seen in the quarter. The Texas economy, obviously, energy dependent to some degree, and then how that factored in 2015 if you're anticipating to see some weaker results in Texas?","Samuel Hazen","In short, we have evaluated the effects of the energy economy, if you will, and what implications it presents for us in Texas. In Texas, economy we believe is significantly more diversified today than it was in years past. Having said that, the Houston market, in particular, is the market that's most susceptible we believe to the energy dynamics are up, but in the face of all of that we've done the diversification in Houston as well. And our overall believe is in 2015, we're not going to have a dramatic impact on trends in Texas.","And so we have not factored in any kind of significant trend change in any of our markets with respect to our assumptions in those particular cities. Again, Houston is the most impacted we believe and we think our strategies are very solid there, and we'll be able endure some modest change in their economy. And that has been one of the better economies across HCA, when you look market activity and economic growth and so forth. Houston, that's obviously the most significant economy by itself. And you do see that reducing, but the effect of that is not going to be material.","End of Q&A","Milton Johnson","Thank you everyone and we look forward to hearing from you. And Mark will be here all day, if you're willing to chat. Thank you and have a great week","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"10712":["HCA Holdings Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell.  Please go ahead, sir.","Victor Campbell","Jennifer, thank you, and good morning everyone.  Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome everyone on today\u2019s call, as well as those of you listening to the webcast.  With me here this morning as usual is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations.  Several other members of the senior management team are with us here as well to assist during the Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management\u2019s current expectations.  Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today.  Many of these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the Company\u2019s future results are beyond the ability of the Company to control or predict.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements.  The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.  And as you heard, the call is being recorded with replay available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Bracken","All right, thank you Vic and thanks to all for joining our call this morning.  Let me just say at the outset that we were pleased with our overall performance in the second quarter.  In general, we saw a continuation of trends that we\u2019ve been reporting on in recent quarters; that is, favorable growth in patient volumes, effective expense management, and continued pressure on revenue rate growth.  Regarding our revenue rate growth performance, patient acuity as measured by case mix index increased slightly, but we continued to see pressure from Medicaid revenue rate declines.  ","For the quarter consolidated and reported adjusted EBITDA increased 10.5% to $1.569 billion from $1.42 billion in the prior year, and same facility adjusted EBITDA increased 5.2%.  Our volumes continued to trend favorably to the prior period.  On a same facility basis, admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.5% and 3.9% respectively, and on an as-reported basis admissions increased 7.7%.  And please recall that these as-reported numbers reflect the consolidation of the Health One acquisition last year.  We believe that our comprehensive service line strategy continues to provide a very firm foundation for this composite growth.","As an example, behavioral health and inpatient rehab admissions each increased approximately 14% during the quarter.  We have now experienced 19 consecutive quarters of positive equivalent admissions growth.  Additionally, we continue to experience favorable growth trends in emergency visit volumes.  As reported, emergency visit growth was 13.4% and 8.8% on a same facility basis.  This performance is important in driving our overall admission levels since approximately 65% of our admissions come through our emergency department.  Also, Sam will update in his remarks market share information.","The Company reported favorable cash flows from operations in the second quarter totaling 1.46 billion.  For the first six months of 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $2.257 billion.  Capital expenditures totaled $449 million in the quarter and our leverage ratio, which was 4.46 times at the end of last year, has improved to 4.2 times at the end of the second quarter.","I\u2019d also like to mention Parallon\u2019s recent agreement with LifePoint Hospitals to provide full revenue cycle outsourcing and full service purchasing and accounts payable sourcing services for their hospitals.  We also extended our IT service agreement with LifePoint by four years and we are pleased with Parallon\u2019s success over this past year and believe Parallon is well positioned to deliver solutions to improve cost efficiency and cash flow to other healthcare providers.","Now before turning the call over to Milton, let me just add that we do expect a story, possibly two, to run in the New York Times as early as this week.  Based on the feedback we\u2019ve received and the questions we\u2019ve been asked, we believe the stories will include several topic areas:  first, our ownership structure; second, the quality of care including medical necessity for cardiac services at certain of our Florida hospitals and wound care; our use of the ACEP \u2013 American College of Emergency Physicians \u2013 evaluation and management guidelines in our emergency departments; and our approach to care for the uninsured.  Obviously, we do not know the precise contents of the story but to give you some context as you consider the article, we are posting some related information on our website.","Thanks again to our management teams for a solid performance for the quarter and to our clinicians and caregivers as they navigate in this period of change in America\u2019s healthcare delivery system.  And with that, let me ask Milton to say a few comments about the numbers.","Milton Johnson","Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all.  Hopefully most of you have had an opportunity to review our second quarter earnings release issued this morning.  I believe most of the numbers are fairly straightforward, but as a reminder the Health One consolidation is included in our reported results for the quarter; however, it is not included in our same facility stats.","As Richard mentioned, the second quarter results were once again driven by strong same facility volume growth and excellent expense management.  As we anticipated, our case mix stabilized in the second quarter with all payors showing increases in their case mix, with the exception of Medicaid which declined 1.1% compared to the prior year.  Same facility total case mix for the Company increased 0.4% in the second quarter and our same facility adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 20.5% as compared to the second quarter of last year.  ","Revenues in the second quarter increased 11.9% to 8.112 billion, primarily driven by the consolidation of our Health One venture and increased patient volumes.  Same facility revenues increased 3.8% in the second quarter compared to the prior year.  ","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. totaled 391 million or $0.85 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to 229 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011.  Last year\u2019s results include losses on retirement of debt of 75 million or $0.08 per diluted share.  ","For the second quarter, volume trends remain strong with same facility admissions increasing 2.5% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 3.9%.  Patient volume growth was primarily driven by increased same facility medical admissions of 4.1% while same facility surgical admissions declined 0.8% compared to the prior period.  Total admissions, which include our Health One consolidation increased 7.7% and equivalent admissions increased 9.7% during the second quarter.  ","During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.1% and 4.3% respectively.  Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare.  Managed Medicare admissions increased 15.4% on a same facility basis and now represent 26.3% of our total Medicare admissions.  Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 4% with same facility equivalent admissions increasing 6.6% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period.  Same facility managed care and other admissions declined slightly \u2013 0.7% in the second quarter; however, same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.4% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly increase.  ","Same facility uninsured admissions increased 8.9% in the second quarter compared to the prior year second quarter.  This growth in uninsured admissions accounted for 65 basis points of the 2.5% same facility admission growth during the quarter.  Same facility uninsured admissions represent 7.8% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.4% in last year\u2019s second quarter.","Total surgeries were flat year over year on a same facility basis, reflecting modest growth in our outpatient surgeries while inpatient surgeries declined slightly.  We continued to experience strong same facility emergency room visits in the second quarter, increasing 8.8% compared to the prior year.  On a reported basis, emergency room visits increased 13.4%.","Same facility revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.1% in the second quarter.  As I have stated on several occasions, several factors are influencing our revenue per equivalent admission including Medicaid rate cuts in Florida and Texas and changes in both service mix and payor mix.  In fact, if you look just at our combined same facility Medicare and managed care revenue per equivalent admission in the quarter, it increased by 2.5% compared to the prior year.","Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.7% compared to the prior year and same facility Medicare case mix increased 0.6% in the second quarter.  Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 15.5%, and that\u2019s generally consistent with recent quarters.  We expect to see less Medicaid rate pressure in the second half of 2012 as we anniversary the Florida rate cut in July of 2011.  ","Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% on a same facility basis in the quarter, which is slightly better than the 4.1% we reported in the first quarter of this year.  Managed care and other same facility case mix increased 0.5% compared to the prior year second quarter.","Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by 243 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year, and during the second quarter same facility charity care discounts totaled 706 million, an increase of 52 million from  the prior year while same facility uninsured discounts totaled 1.526 billion, an increase of 191 million from the prior year.  ","Once again, we were extremely pleased with expense management in the quarter as same facility operating expense per equivalent admission \u2013 and this again would exclude the equity and earnings of affiliates and electronic health records incentive income \u2013 increased only 0.1% compared to the prior year.  This is the fourth consecutive quarter where operating expense per equivalent admission is essentially flat with the prior year period.","Salaries per equivalent admission increased 0.8% compared to the prior year on a same facility basis.  The same facility productivity performance improved 1.6% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.  Same facility wage growth was 1.3% in the second quarter.  Also, personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by 14 million or 5.5% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter, a significant reduction from recent run rates.","Same facility supply costs per equivalent admission declined 2.2% from the prior year, reflecting minimal supply cost inflation and the Company\u2019s supply cost reduction initiatives.  Same facility other operating costs per equivalent admission increased 0.7% from the prior year.","The Company recognized 70 million in electronic health record incentive income in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations.  The Company also incurred approximately 19 million in EHR-related expense in the second quarter compared to 24 million in the second quarter of 2011.  Our monitoring mechanisms continue to report that we are achieving Stage 1 Year 2 meaningful use, and we expect to certify such at most of our hospitals during the fourth quarter of this year.","Interest expense declined 72 million from 520 million for the second quarter of 2011 to 448 million for the second quarter of 2012.  This reduction in interest expense reflects the benefits of debt refinancing transactions we completed during 2011 and has a positive impact on our cash flows.  Cash flows from operating activities in the second quarter increased to 1.46 billion compared to 748 million last year.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of 165 million and an increase in favorable changes to operating assets and liabilities in the quarter of 525 million, including our receipt of approximately 270 million in payments on the rural floor Medicare receivable that was recorded in the first quarter of 2012.","For the six months ended June 30, 2012, our free cash flow after CAPEX and distributions to non-controlling interests totaled 1.282 billion.  ","Capital spend in the second quarter totaled 449 million compared to 447 million last year.  This is consistent with our expectations and guidance for the full year.  Days in accounts receivable at June 30, 2012 were 50 days, a decline of three days from March 2012 and unchanged from June 30, 2011.  Days in AR declined partially due to the receipt of the aforementioned rural floor Medicare settlement.","At June 30, 2012, the Company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times compared to 4.43 times at March 30, 2012 and 4.46 times at December 31, 2011.  At the end of July, we had approximately 3.475 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.  And finally, as you saw in the release this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2012.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sam.","Sam Hazen","Good morning.  I\u2019ll begin my comments this morning with more detail on our volume trends for the quarter and then wrap up with a review of our market share data for year ending 2011.","The performance across the Company\u2019s 15 divisions was very balanced again this quarter, indicating broad-based execution of the Company\u2019s growth strategy.  Ten out of 15 divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admits on a year-over-year basis.  Our Denver market, which is not included in same facility admits, had year-over-year growth in inpatient admissions also.  All but two divisions had growth in same facility adjusted admits.","All divisions had growth in emergency room visits again this quarter.  Also, same facility managed care emergency room visits increased 6.1% for the quarter, reflecting improved outreach and greater access in this segment of the market.  The emergency room continues to drive strong inpatient admits for the Company.  Admissions through our emergency room were up 6.1%.","EMS drop-offs to our emergency rooms were up 6.5%.  We believe this growth in EMS volume is a function of program development such as trauma and stroke, plus more efficient turnaround capabilities for our ambulance partners.  ","Although surgical volumes were flat for the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the results of our surgical growth plan.  Seven divisions had growth in same facility surgical volumes for the quarter.  Four of the divisions that had declines were only down by less than 1%.  Orthopedic and neurosciences were the two areas that continued to show solid growth.  Cardiovascular services and general surgery were essentially flat while women\u2019s and urological services were down.  Critical care admits in both our adult and neonatal units grew 4.7% in total; length of stay, however, was down by 3%.","Now let me transition to 2011 year-end market share.  As a reminder, market share data is not available for all HCA markets.  We are able to get approximately 85% of the Company\u2019s market share in a reasonable time period, usually 120 to 180 days after the fact, so I will be sharing some highlights from the most recent time period, which is the fourth quarter of 2011.","First, the Company\u2019s overall market share for 2011 improved by 35 basis points to almost 23%.  We gained market share on a sequential basis in each of the four quarters, gaining an additional 11 basis points in the fourth quarter.  The Company increased market share in 24 out of 37 markets.  We had growth in market share in 12 out of 17 service lines that we studied.  Market share in the commercial segment grew, and finally we saw growth in the end migration segment, reflecting progress with our rural outreach efforts.  ","Overall, demand for inpatient services in HCA markets grew in 2011 by 0.7%, which is a slight improvement over the rate of growth in 2010.  Using this rate of growth as a proxy for the market growth in the first half of 2012 suggests that HCA is still gaining share with our year-to-date admission growth of 2.9%.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor Campbell","All right.  Sam, thank you, Milton, Richard.","Let me say this before I turn the call back to Jennifer.  In the interest of time, I would like to ask that everyone keep their questions this morning focused on the quarter and our business overall rather than get into any speculation about the potential article that Richard discussed.  I think between Richard\u2019s comments and also the website posting which he mentioned, that\u2019s all we really can and have to say about that matter this morning, and I appreciate your understanding.  And I might just note that that website is hcahealthcare.com, and it\u2019s on the home page; but we hope you listen to the Q&A here because I think we had an excellent quarter that you probably have some interest in.","So with that, Jennifer, you want to poll for questions?  Again, try to hold to one because I know we have a lot of people on today\u2019s call.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  Today\u2019s question and answer session will be conducted electronically.  [Operator instructions]","And we\u2019ll go first to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning.  ","Victor Campbell ","Hi Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi.  So the 8.8% ER increase was particularly strong, especially in a non-flu quarter.  Maybe just remind us your initiatives there, and maybe have there been any closures of competing hospitals or EDs that can help explain some of that increase?  And then just along those lines, bad debt was up a fair amount, so is that also a function of the increase in ED, and then just related to that, the use of ACEP that you talked about.  I think that\u2019s been in place for a while.  Maybe just some context there.  Thanks.","Sam Hazen","I\u2019ll start with the\u2014this is Sam.  I\u2019ll start with the emergency room growth.  I think the emergency room growth that we are seeing is a function of a significant effort that the Company has made over many, many years to improve our emergency room operations, and that effort, I think, if I could categorically answer it would really come down to four or five major efforts.  One is clearly improving our operations and how we take care of our patients when they enter the emergency room, and I think we\u2019ve done an incredible job at dropping our time to see a patient from maybe 45 to 50 minutes to somewhere around 22 minutes on average across the company, and that\u2019s clearly enhancing the service level and the satisfaction that we are seeing in the emergency room.","The second thing that I would add that I think is having a tremendous impact is the fact that we\u2019re adding a lot of program capability, and by program capability \u2013 I mentioned that in my comments earlier \u2013 we\u2019ve added a number of trauma programs where it adds a level of sophistication to our emergency rooms, creates a better destination point for EMS services and so forth, and on top of that trauma development.  We\u2019ve developed sophisticated stroke capabilities in a number of our emergency rooms as well as cardiac capabilities, and I think, again, the combination of those program developments are adding volume as well.","And then the third piece \u2013 and there\u2019s one more after this one \u2013 that I would point to that I think is having a positive impact is capacity.  I mean, we have clearly added capacity in our emergency rooms where we have had compression.  We monitor our utilization per bed on a routine basis, and where we start to see capacity constraints we add capital either on our campus or in some cases off our campus in locations that need emergency capabilities.","And then finally, marketing \u2013 I think we\u2019ve marketed our emergency rooms in a way that showcases the performance and the capabilities, and the combination of those four things, I think are really driving the activity in our markets.  ","We have not seen any particular closures that have yielded market share gains or anything of that nature in the emergency services, so that\u2019s really not a factor in what we\u2019re seeing in our markets.","Victor Campbell","Milt, you want to do the bad debt question?","Milton Johnson","","Yeah, I\u2019d be happy to.  The primary reason for the increase in bad debt expense relates to increase in uninsured revenues, so we basically have reserved for that.  The remaining bad debt increase is really related to co-pay and deductibles, and there we\u2019re up about\u2014bad debt is up about 10%, or roughly about $25 million, and that\u2019s related to higher managed care volumes that we\u2019ve reported.  Sam mentioned the new trauma programs in the ED.  Those trauma programs do result in some higher co-pays and so that\u2019s contributing to a piece of that, and then just the normal plan increases that we\u2019re seeing in co-pay and deductibles to our patients driving the remaining part.","So it\u2019s not any one thing, but it primarily is the uninsured revenue growth that\u2019s driving bad debt.","Victor Campbell","All right.  Ralph, thank you.  I\u2019m sorry \u2013 Sam?","Sam Hazen","","Yeah.  And I wanted to add, Ralph, one thing to the discussion.  I think, again, HCA\u2019s portfolio of markets, when you look at the demographics and you look at the population trends and some of those dynamics that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s having an impact on emergency services demand within our markets as well.  So that\u2019s another component that I think is driving growth that maybe is different than what you\u2019re seeing across the industry.","Victor Campbell ","","All right, thank you.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody.  Wanted to ask here a question about just volumes, and specifically as it relates to the growth you\u2019ve seen in psychiatric and inpatient within the units in your hospitals.  Thanks for giving us the growth of 14% from those units.  Can you maybe just update us a little bit on the strategy there and also if you could help us just put into perspective the growth that you\u2019re seeing in those services on the overall admission trend number?  How much have we seen that contribute, say, over the year-to-date and this quarter specifically?","Victor Campbell","All right, thanks Darren.  I think, Sam, you\u2019re up again.","Sam Hazen","I couldn\u2019t hear the first part, but I think you were asking, Darren, about behavioral health and rehab with the growth of 14%.  Let me just give you some sense of what we saw as an opportunity, again, a few years back.","In certain hospitals and within certain markets, we had idle capacity that we felt was not being used effectively, and in a number of those markets we did not have a full complement of services around rehabilitation capability as well as behavioral health capability.  And so we saw two opportunities at a macro level with this initiative, one being, again, using idle capacity and then secondly adding network capability to really service our overall complement of hospitals in a particular market.  And over the past number of years, we have invested a little heavier in behavioral health, and rehabilitation services is catching up as far as overall investment.  I think at this particular point in time, we have north of 50 units in both services across the Company where we have capabilities, and we\u2019ve seen growth in both of those fairly consistent this year around 15% year-to-date on psychiatric and behavioral health admissions, so the quarter is consistent with year-to-date growth.  And then on the rehabilitation side, again, we\u2019ve seen growth at 13% year-to-date, very comparable to the second quarter.","The behavioral health capability has enhanced our ability, again, in the emergency room and that has freed up capacity for us to take care of emergent patients and then network and transfer behavioral health patients that access our emergency rooms and need behavioral health services.  So it\u2019s really played a big part in an overall comprehensive market strategy, and as we look forward we still have opportunities with capacity and we are investing in those in both services lines; and again, rehabilitation is not as far along in its progression as behavioral health is.","Victor Campbell","All right.  Thanks, Darren.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s helpful.  Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to AJ Rice with UBS.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Hello everybody.  Maybe I\u2019ll just switch gears and ask you about the cash flow trends and use of cash going forward.  You look like you\u2019re now at a point where you\u2019re probably running ahead of where you thought you would be year-to-date, and maybe that means that you\u2019ll beat the cash flow guidance for the year.  Maybe comment on that, and then also give us some flavor for use of cash flow going forward, I guess particularly in the context of all the refinancings that have already been done and where the debt levels are now.  Does that give you flexibility to look at other uses for free cash flow?","Victor Campbell","All right, Milton, that one\u2019s yours.","Milton Johnson","Sure.  Yes, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the cash flow performance for the first half of the year and it is ahead of our expectations.  Of course, one reason would be the rural floor settlement of about $270 million that we didn\u2019t have in our guidance at the beginning of the year, and that certainly is a piece of it; but overall, our cash flow has been very strong.","Our cash flow guidance that we gave, I think was 3.4 to about 3.6 billion as we started the year, and I would say now that that\u2019s probably closer to 3.8 to 4 billion cash flow from operations as we look at the rest of the year.  We will see, I think, higher tax payments in the second half of the year that typically happens, so that, I think, will slow down the rate of free cash flow from operations compared to what we reported year halfway through the year.","With respect to use of cash, we continue to look for acquisition opportunities.  Our pipeline, as the other companies have mentioned as well, remains very strong.  We see some good opportunities there.  It\u2019s too early to tell how all those will play out, but we think there will be good opportunities to invest our cash in some acquisitions.  Following that, we\u2019ll continue to repay debt as we have so far this year.  As you noticed here at the second quarter, our debt levels on an absolute basis were basically flat with where we started the year.  We have covered the leverage from the dividend that we paid in February of this year.  So again\u2014also for the second half of this year, I think our CAPEX run rate will be higher than the first half of the year.  We still expect CAPEX to be somewhere around 1.8 to 1.9 billion, and so we\u2019ll have a little bit of acceleration in the second half of the year to hit that target.","Absent acquisitions and debt repayment, again from time to time as we have in the past, we would consider a special dividend opportunity depending on the market; and again, those decisions are made based on market conditions at the time that we\u2019re reviewing those decisions.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks a lot.","Victor Campbell","Thanks AJ.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.","Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners","Good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  I did want to ask just one follow-up about the American College of Emergency Physicians.  Was hoping maybe you could just give us some color on\u2014remind us why you switched to that methodology a couple years back?","Victor Campbell","Yeah, we could barely hear you, but you were just asking why we did it.  Okay, thinking going back, we changed to ACEP a number of years ago.","Sam Hazen","Yeah, in 2009 we made that change, and primarily we felt like it was a better system, a system that resulted in a higher level or higher quality coding result for our patient assignment under the emergency room evaluation and management guidelines.  So it was done to improve, again, our assignment of those patients in the ER.","Richard Bracken","Yeah, and remember as we\u2019ve described the ACEP or how this happens in emergency departments, there are different systems out there and what we had been using before was a point system, and what that meant is that people would look at the services provided in emergency services, apply certain points according to a scale, total those points up and establish the classification for the visits.  What the ACEP system does, and to understand how that works, is it looks for proxies to establish levels of care, and so it\u2019s a much more accurate system and efficient system to put in place, so that\u2019s why we went to it.","Victor Campbell","Thanks for your question and welcome to the call.","Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  We\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning.  Good quarter.  Just a question in light of the changes in the assumptions surrounding HCIT \u2013 I\u2019m just curious, are you kind of maintaining some conservatism by not raising your estimates, and maybe you can give us an update on how you see Florida and Texas playing out.  Thanks.","Victor Campbell","Milton, you want--?","Milton Johnson","Yeah.  Well, no we did not raise our guidance.  We are halfway through the year, and if you look at although we\u2014our performance has been very solid relative to our guidance.  If you look at the pieces of it, volume\u2019s been better, about 1% better than we had projected in our guidance for the first half of the year, but our revenue rate is below what we had projected for the first half of the year by about 1% as well.  We\u2019ve made it up with better expense management of about almost 1.5% better than we thought on our expense management.  So net-net, we\u2019re doing well relative to our guidance.","But at halfway through the year, again, our expectation is still within that range.  We gave a $250 million range for EBITDA for this year and we feel like that is still the range that we would like to keep at this point in time of the year.","Victor Campbell","All right.  One of you want to address Texas and Florida Medicaid?  I think that was the second half of your question, Frank?","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes.","Victor Campbell","Okay.  ","Sam Hazen","Well, in Texas\u2014let me start there.  The anniversary date of the cuts that we\u2019ve experienced this year, I think, is 9\/30, so 10\/1 we\u2019ll anniversary last year\u2019s budget cuts.  The two outstanding items that we are yet to get final rules on are the disproportionate share funding requirements in Texas as well as the Texas waiver.  Both of those components are yet to be finalized.  We still are working with the State and others on that process, and so there\u2019s uncertainty still around that particular resolution on those items.","With respect to Florida, there are some remaining cuts that we will experience in the second half of this year, although they are less than what we experienced in the previous year.  We anniversaried last year\u2019s cuts on June 30, and then next year\u2019s cuts are forecasted to be around 5%, and I think the annualized effect on those is about $25 million or something like that, that we\u2019ve estimated at this particular point in time.  So that\u2019s sort of the status of those two states.","Victor Campbell","All right.  Frank, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Markets.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Markets","Hi there.  ","Victor Campbell","Good morning, Sheryl.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Markets","It\u2019s such a simple name!  Okay.  ","Victor Campbell","We know who you are!","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Markets","Yeah, I\u2019m hard to miss.  Okay, well first of all, thank you for the very good explanation of the pricing.  That\u2019s very, very helpful.  I\u2019m going to not ask you about the investigation for the article by not asking you about it, but I\u2019m going to ask you about something else that\u2019s somewhat related because your stock is under pressure and it is of concern.  So you all have had\u2014our environment is now one that\u2019s very focused on not only controlling revenues but also controlling waste and fraudulent spending in healthcare \u2013 that\u2019s a blanket statement.  So what are you all doing in your compliance programs to beef up what presumably is already a robust program, especially now that it seems that this focus is more on the physician decision-making capabilities and outcomes as well as related to, in quotes, quality of care issues as much as it is just billing.  How are you managing through that, especially given how many physicians you employ as well as contract with or are related to or affiliated with in your markets?  So an update on compliance, if you would.","Richard Bracken","Let me take a first shot at that.  This is Richard speaking.  Well first of all\u2014and as you mentioned, we do have a robust compliance program in place and it\u2019s been out there, as you know, since the late 90\u2019s.  And as you mentioned, we have extensive policies and procedures, training protocols, ethic lines, vehicles for people to raise questions in place.  We follow it up with ambitious monitoring and reviewing and surveys, so all that\u2019s been in place.  We think it\u2019s a very important and effective program.","You bring up new issues that the industry is experiencing and how do we think about it.  I would say fundamentally the first thing we\u2019re thinking about is putting in physician leadership at various levels in our organization that have the job to sit on top of all the existing activities that are underway.  Throughout the course of the last 12 months, we\u2019ve put in addition to physician leadership that might exist in the hospitals, additional physician leadership at every one of our divisions who can sit on top and look at broad trends that might be occurring in a marketplace.  We\u2019ve added significant physician leadership in the management of our physician practices.  We have moved our physician practices into a wholly-owned organization with significant physician leadership and councils to help sort out these questions.","So we\u2014and in addition to other issues, we bring in specialty councils to help us decide issues of care that we can move across the enterprise, and I think fundamentally and foundationally probably one of the most important things in addition to all of this is that we\u2019re investing big time in the EHR.  And of course, the EHR is out there to be more accurate but it also creates a database to mine issues, to understand how care is being provided not only efficiently but compliantly, and we have been on a quest to develop a system-wide EHR for years before the stimulus, the high tech program was put in.  We think it\u2019s foundational to the Company and we are continuing to execute that as fast and as efficiently as we possibly can.","So I think it\u2019s a combination of all these areas, not only the monitoring, not only the policies and procedures, but the leadership, the organization and the infrastructure to make it happen.","Victor Campbell","Sheryl, thank you.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, hello.  I appreciate not wanting to talk about the New York Times investigation, but I\u2019d really like to see if there\u2019s any color we can get on the Florida investigation because there we have some disclosures that you could potentially respond to.  I mean, the investigation into interventional cardiology services, is that just a continuation of what we saw at the end of last year as far as some of these RAC things?  I guess the fact that you\u2019re calling it interventional cardiology is something different than the ICD scrutiny.  It implies things like stents and balloon angioplasty, so I was just wondering if there\u2019s any detail that you can flesh out there.","Victor Campbell","Okay, Kevin.  I\u2019ll do that, and I guess if you have not\u2014I mean, obviously we had disclosed in our 10-Q this morning that we did receive an inquiry from civil division in Miami U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and it came in July so it is new.  And it\u2019s requested information on any reviews that were assessing the medical necessity of interventional cardiology services at any of our facilities.  I think principally as we\u2019re looking now, we\u2019re trying to review to determine exactly which hospitals have had such reviews.  At this point, we\u2019re early in our analysis but we have identified about 10 facilities, a majority of those in Florida but there are, I think, two or three in some other states.","So we\u2019re gathering that.  Again, we\u2019ve just gotten the request, preliminary stages, and so really responding beyond that or trying to identify beyond what we\u2019ve put in our disclosure would be premature at this point.  So we\u2019ve sort of given you everything we\u2019ve got and can tell you at this point in time.","Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Hey, good morning guys.  The first is just a clarification, so I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t count as a question.  You had mentioned some new information on the website \u2013 were you saying that was already available, because I was just kind of perusing it and not seeing it.  So maybe if you could direct us where that would be?","Victor Campbell","Yeah, I\u2019m being told there is a blue bar across the top of the home website, and it\u2019s on the home page.  It was put on, I think as we started our call; so yes, it is new and should be there.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Maybe I just need to update then.  Okay, we\u2019ll look for that.  I guess the question I wanted to ask for Milt\u2014actually I refreshed and it\u2019s there now, so you\u2019re right \u2013 blue bar on the top of the home page.  ","Victor Campbell","You are a techie!  Way to go, Gary.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","A question for Milt, just going back to the pressure that the Medicaid rate has had on your consolidated same store revenue per adjusted admission.  I guess it looks like that\u2019s contributed about at least 150 basis points of year-over-year pressure on that metric.  Is there a range, I guess, you have in mind as we move into the back half of the year?  I mean, should we see at least or approximately 100 basis points of that coming back in your favor in the back half?  Is that about the magnitude of what you expect?","Milton Johnson","Well Gary, maybe let me help with it a little bit.  First of all, the impact on our Medicaid rate has been more than we thought it would be, primarily in Florida.  We had estimated that in the first half of this year, it would probably be about a $35 million impact.  I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably close to double that impact on our rate in the first half of the year, so the second half of the year\u2014you know, Sam just mentioned that we will see an additional cut in Florida starting July 1 of this year, but that cut will be, we think, substantially less.  ","So if you think about a negative run rate of, call it 60 to 70 million in the first half of this year on Florida Medicaid, in the second half of the year I\u2019d say it would be more like maybe 15 million is what we\u2019re thinking as far as drag.  So we will get some relief on the Florida impact.","With respect to Texas, the cuts we\u2019re taking there are about 7 to 8 million a month on reductions in Texas Medicaid, and that anniversaries, I believe, at the end of September.  And as of now, we don\u2019t see any additional Texas cuts and don\u2019t expect that.  So again, in the fourth quarter, a little bit of help from Texas as well in the Medicaid rate.","So that\u2019s kind of how I see the second half of the year relative to those two states.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay, thanks Milt.","Victor Campbell","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  It looks like your tax rate was down a little bit sequentially.  Milton, can you just maybe give us some guidance in terms of where you would expect it to be in the second half of the year, and maybe for the full year?","Milton Johnson","Yeah, it was down a little bit in this quarter.  We did\u2014we settled some disputes with the IRS and as a result, tax exempt interest expense, which is part of the tax rate, we had a reduction of 11 million in the quarter and that reduced the rate.","The normalized rate, I would expect would be somewhere around 37 to 38%.  I think it was about 35 or so in this quarter.  So 37 to 38 sort of zone would be a normalized rate.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great.  Thanks a lot.","Victor Campbell","Thanks Gary.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hey, thanks.  Good morning.  I guess really just a question for maybe Richard or Sam.  We\u2019ve recently seen sort of a number of deals in the physician area, medical group management, whatever you really want to call this sector.  I\u2019m just kind of curious on your perspective for what this trend may mean to you.  You\u2019ve obviously seen a lot of cycles with this in the past and have been pretty aggressive in a lot of your markets organizing docs in the last few years.  So just kind of curious on your broader thoughts.","Richard Bracken","Well in terms of the sort of transactions for large physician groups that you mentioned, and the ones that I\u2019m aware of were focused in areas where they have a concentration of physicians really were not in our markets.  And so they really don\u2019t apply to sort of our strategy.","We look at physician integration on a range of fronts and local market by local market, so again, we think about how to integrate with physicians not only in sort of an employment model that you\u2019re referencing through some of these acquisitions perhaps, but lots of other ways as well in terms of service and connectivity and ITS connectivity and the like.  And so we\u2019re careful about that.  The price on the one transaction I think you\u2019re referring to in southern California was very, very high, and that\u2019s not really sort of our model.  We look at physician integration market by market and we look at a range of options other than just full employment.","Sam Hazen","Yeah and Richard, if I could add, when we look at the active number of physicians at HCA\u2019s medical staff this year compared to where it was at the end of last year, we have grown the number of physicians who have active privileges at HCA facilities by approximately 1,000 on a base of about 34,000, so pretty significant growth.  Some of that has come through employment where we have added employment numbers to our base from last year and then clearly recruitment, and at the same time in supporting some of our service line strategies we\u2019ve added physician capability either through recruitment locally or other methods to enhance the number of physicians that practice at our facilities.  So from that standpoint, it really had to fit into the overall growth strategy within our markets, as Richard mentioned, and that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re thinking about it.  But I don\u2019t see it as necessarily slowing down.  We are getting better at making decisions on the front end, and we are getting much better at managing the practices on the back end, and the combination of that is allowing us to really execute this strategy more effectively than we were in previous years, we believe.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, thanks for the thoughts.","Victor Campbell","Thanks Whit.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning.  Just a follow-up on the Medicaid in Florida and then a question about managed care.  You mentioned that the Medicaid hit in Florida was bigger than you thought it was going to be.  Could you just give us a little bit of color how you got that wrong and why you sort of can identify the incremental cuts that are coming a little bit more accurately?  And then on managed care, not only were you seeing on sort of absolute rates as you\u2019re negotiating but are there any changes in terms of the terms, risk-taking, et cetera?  Thanks.","Victor Campbell","All right.  We\u2019re pointing the finger at Mike Marks since he\u2019s our CFO of that group.","Mike Marks","So one concept would be length of stay.  In Florida with Medicaid, you\u2019re paid a per diem.  Our length of stay is down a couple of points, so that\u2019s one reason why it was worse than we expected.  The second thing, and I think has been described previously on other calls, is there\u2019s movement between self-paying Medicaid to eligibility processes, and we\u2019ve seen that movement hurt us in the first half of this year.  That moves around as you go through timing between as self-pays come in, you try to get them converted to Medicaid through the eligibility processes.  So between those movements and a little drop in length of stay would be the primary differences between what we expected and our actual results.","Milton Johnson","Yeah, it\u2019s just not as simple as taking a prior year number and taking the haircut on it.  It\u2019s a pretty complicated, as Mike just described, calculation to try to estimate that, and some things moved on us that we didn\u2019t expect \u2013 that\u2019s the short story.","With respect to managed care, I think your question was around we\u2019re seeing any structural differences, and we\u2019re not.  We\u2019ve got virtually all of our 2012 managed care revenue under contract, like 95, 96%.  We\u2019ve got 70% of next year\u2019s managed care revenue under contract and about 40% of the following year; so again, as we typically have this time of the year, good visibility with respect to our managed care revenue and we continue to see rates similar to what we historically have been reporting in the 5 to 6% sort of zone, and at this time no real structural changes to those contracts.","Victor Campbell","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, good morning.  With respect to the Florida and Texas Medicaid programs, I know that it\u2019s not just about rate but they\u2019re also trying to manage utilization.  Have you seen any utilization changes as a result of that?","Sam Hazen","This is Sam.  Not materially.  There may be some adjustments on the fringes in those states as certain programs migrate to managed care, but our volumes in both of those states are way up.

As a follow-up, what are your latest thoughts on separate reporting and more disclosure on Parallon?  Thanks.","Victor Campbell","Sure.  Milton?","Milton Johnson","Yeah, this is Milton.  We continue to analyze that at the end of each year as we think about the coming year, so our team will go through that process at the end of this year as we think about reporting for 2013.  At this point in time, I think still from a materiality standpoint, we\u2019re not there; but as we continue to see growth in Parallon, that can change.  So it\u2019s a process we review at the end of each year.","John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thanks a lot.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, John.  Jennifer, I think we\u2019ve got time for one last question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Vicki Bryan with Gimme Credit.  ","Vicki Bryan \u2013 Gimme Credit","Along the lines of the previous question, can you tell us what percentage of the total admissions and equivalent admissions this quarter that you saw with the behavioral health and rehab?  Can you break that out for us?","Victor Campbell","This quarter behavioral health and rehab, the percent of admissions?  ","Sam Hazen","Yeah, the answer is one-third of our overall growth is related to those two services lines; and keep in mind that behavioral health and rehab represent approximately 7 or 8% of our total admissions approximately, and that was a pretty consistent metric for year-to-date as well.","Vicki Bryan \u2013 Gimme Credit","And that\u2019s for equivalent admissions as well?","","Sam Hazen","Well, it\u2019s more on the inpatient side.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Kyle. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As usual, Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call including those of you listening to the webcast. And with me here this morning, our chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO.","Before we turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause annual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release.","As you heard, the call is being recorded and a replay will become available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Milton Johnson.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning each of you joining our call this morning. I trust most of you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter results released this morning. I will make a couple of comments on the quarter, touch on a couple of other topics, then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on our third quarter results.","I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We've continued use or free cash flow to invest in our markets to support future growth and we've returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase from the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the quarter.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7% while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claim calls. Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings before gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims cost increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized reductions in its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share, and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns.","Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We've repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share and we had $390 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year.","Let me provide an update on recent hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the events without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. Yesterday, we announce an agreement with University Hospitals Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of The Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of a joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes two other hospitals to University Hospitals Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details on the quarter.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year-to-date equivalent admissions are up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more commentary on volume in a moment and I'll give you some trends by payer class.","During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 3.2% over the prior year. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4% respectively in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. These represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year.","Managed care another including exchange admissions declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed other and exchange-equivalent admissions remain slightly up. Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increase 2.7%. Managed care and other including exchange revenue per equivalent admission is treated consistent with prior periods. And adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period.","Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70 basis point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared the prior year and supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year.","Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last two calls.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 (11:18) billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86 times at September 30, 2016, compared to 3.85 times at December 31, 2015.","I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost, and gains or losses on sales of facilities increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting a new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exam settlement. These strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company.","Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter last year for a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of 2015 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters.","So that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%.","In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedic, and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness.","Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. Three of our largest behavioral hospital units had staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits in this service line would've been up 4.5%.","Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration in the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%, and finally, the company's urgent care visits in total grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers.","All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison, with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following two reasons. First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this six-month period. This rate was down from the previous five quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but it is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets.","Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continued to be challenged with Medicare Advantage health plans that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions.","Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategies, and multiple human resource programs including medical staff development. In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines and we believe our local provider systems are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Sam. Thank you very much. At this time, Kyle, if you'll come back on, we'll move to Q&A. I do encourage everyone, I know we've got a lot of folks on the call today. And as usual, please try to limit your questions to one at a time. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning. So thank you for mentioning that this was a tough comp in a tough quarter. From that perspective, I think folks have maybe forgot to put it in that perspective. But I'm curious since you're seeing this moderating in growth, one of the ways you might deal with that is by repositioning the portfolio to perhaps focus your capital spending and your capacity expansion efforts in more attractive markets. Was that behind the Oklahoma transaction that you announced at a curious time last night just before earnings or was there some other reason? If you could explore that a little bit and what the opportunities are with deploying capital, I'd appreciate it.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam, you want to take that up?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Sheryl. Oklahoma City, let me just give a little background and then I'll relate it to your question, I think, Sheryl. We had a relationship that dates back to 1998 with, I'll say it's the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998 and when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospitals.","When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint and a very innovative public-private partnership. So there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains, and so forth that have really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where it needed additional capital and unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made.","So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation. And that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us in the context of what we needed to make his investment there coupled with the type of lease that we had to look at repositioning the capital to be a source for whatever we want to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that and I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Sam, thanks. Milton, you want to add something?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Let me just add that what Sam described, the structure of this particular arrangement, was unique to OU and to Oklahoma City. Our other partnerships that we operate do not have the same structure. So it is a very unique structure how that deal was put together back in 1998. And just wanted to make it clear that our other partnerships did not have that same structure.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thank you. Thank you, Sheryl.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, great, thanks. I want to go back to your comments around volume growth moderating, the I guess demand growth in your markets moderating. And it sounds to me like you are saying it's moderating back to what you see as long-term normal numbers but I guess there's a lot of concern around surveys, and etc., around Q3 volumes and thinking about what the long-term volume is. What's your degree of visibility or confidence that 2% is the right market demand in your markets based upon where things have been trending the last several quarters?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Kevin, thank you. Sam, I think we'll pitch that back to you.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","We go through a process annually where we conduct a forecast of future demand for HCA markets based upon population trends, on macroeconomic factors, on aging and so forth. So that's always a fundamental approach of our business planning process. In addition to that, we compare historically to a longer view to see what the patterns have been in our markets on a historical basis. And we try to merge those two views into our company thinking and company view right now, and that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little more growth than that.","So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest from one quarter in this particular year that that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these two periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of markets still have reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously there's puts and takes to that, but that particular metric I think gives us some confidence as well that our markets are still relatively healthy and present a reasonable opportunity for growth for the company.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Kevin. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Was curious when you talked about the freestanding ED growth and then your growth also in urgent care centers, sounds like that was up 40% or so. You're growing both sides. How do you guys think about that as both a threat and opportunity and how do you decide within a market if you want to open up a freestanding ED versus urgent care center other than the obvious regulatory and certificate of need if necessary, etc.?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Josh, thank you. I think you're winning the lottery here, Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Well, we have evolved are freestanding emergency room strategy over the past 5 years. I think 5 years ago, we had maybe 12-15 freestanding emergency rooms, we have 56 that are operational today, and I think by the end of 2017 or early 2018 we'll be north of 70. And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those.","We see the urgent care as an additional wrap-around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain moments of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency rooms, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals and other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how do we go about building this network further.","In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost in concentric circles of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct as they feel they need to direct but keep them in the HCA system. So it's hard to give you a specific because we have to look at the individual markets, but those are some of the general approaches that we take.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Morning, Michael. You're a little faint. You may want to lean in to your phone a little bit.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Oh, great, how's that?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Much better.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Great. So, can you talk about how your exposure to health plan exchange exiting your markets and just in general if there's any change in your level of network participation in exchanges for 2017?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Michael, thank you. Bill, do you want to \u2013 or Milt...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I'll just make a couple comments about it. Obviously, a lot of movement in exchanges in our markets, as you see in most of the markets across the country. That being said, we still expect product to be available in our markets and probably multiple products in our markets. And we're really watching to see how this open enrollment period develops to see how the lines move around as a result of some of the plans pulling out. Overall, I think on a material level, HCA continues to be very well positioned in exchanges. I expect that we will see some growth, possibly, in our exchange business even into 2017. But obviously, there's some disruption in the marketplace and we're watching very closely. Bill, I don't know...","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I'll just add in. There's clearly a lot of discussion around the plan participation and premium adjustments and what that might do to enrollment. It is early for us to kind of give estimates for 2017, but we were encouraged by recent reports that they're expecting some increase in the exchange enrollment. We'll have to see where that enrollment is coming from for next year to refine our estimates.","I also believe it's important to know we've heard this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we are somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives. So again, I think we're optimistic that health reform will continue to contribute to the company.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick one first. Any prior period revenue that came through in the third quarter? And then separately, just the slowing managed care volume \u2013 just any commentary around what may be driving that? And perhaps how to reinvigorate that category? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Bill?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Ralph, I'll take the first. There was no material out-of-period revenue adjustments in the third quarter.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","And then, Sam, you want to talk about managed care volume?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I'll say this in general. Obviously competition for commercial business is the most intense in all of our markets. Everybody understands the implications of the commercial book, and so there's significant competition in that particular area.","But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about. How do we create outreach into these commercial segments through outpatient facilities, through freestanding emergency rooms, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system?","Additionally, with our physician strategies, we're very targeted in working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream business. And then finally, working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system.","So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We're focusing our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial markets or in outpatient facilities in commercial markets. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios.","But our competitors do that, too, so it's a very competitive landscape, and there's movement in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further, and we're continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic and this market as we move forward.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Ralph, thank you.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Interested if you could talk about the underlying wage inflation trends that you're seeing in the third quarter? Clearly it looks like expense management overall was quite strong, but just interested in the underlying inflation trends that you're seeing relative to earlier this year. Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Scott. You want to...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Well, let me just mention \u2013 this is Milton. I mean, we're not seeing really any substantial change in our wage rate and wage inflation. I think as we've been saying over really the last few quarters, we have pockets of wage pressure from time to time. We're always monitoring the marketplace. We make those adjustments. It's in our run rate, and nothing in particular this quarter, Sam, that I see in the wage inflation that's any different from recent trends.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","And I would add, Milton, that our cost per FTE, when we look at our SWB per FTE, which includes benefits, contract labor and wages as a whole was actually at its lowest point on a year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter. So we have seen moderation in contract labor. We have, as Milton said, made these adjustments ongoing to different markets in different situations as they've surfaced, and we're at a pretty good point we believe with wages. There are clearly some still pressure points across the company, but it's not in all 42 markets. And it's not requiring us to do something uniquely across all 42 markets.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. I know over the next month or two you guys are going to sit down with the field operating people and think about budgets, but at a high level \u2013 and obviously not asking for specific guidance but more broad thoughts about, what are the big variables? I mean, it sounds like a lot of things you sort of feel like you have pretty good trajectory, but as you think about next year, are there any broad headwinds, tailwinds, that people should think about or keep in mind? I know figuring out volumes is always one source of volatility, but I guess you're saying probably around 2% is the way to think about at least the entire company. But how about more broadly, away from volumes? Any other headwind, tailwind that you'd highlight?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. A. J., thanks. Milton, you want...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Well, obviously, A. J., as you just stated we're not prepared to give 2017 guidance this morning. We'll do that on our next call. But we've been I think pretty clear about how we think about the business. Volume is a big variable obviously in our business but, as Sam just described, we have our processes and ways that we look at the future. And we've been very clear that we think in our markets over the longer term, somewhere around 2% is the outlook. And we've been, I think, very public about that.","When you think about the pricing side of our business, we've got good visibility into our managed care portfolio and our managed care book, and a substantial portion of 2017 under contract with rates and structure similar to what we've had the last couple years. So a pretty stable outlook there.","And then wage inflation and overall inflation in our markets, the outlook is probably similar to what we've been seeing in the last couple of years. We just talked about wages, and no particular broad-based pressure there. So we feel good about where we're headed going into 2017, coming out of this year. But we've got a lot of work to do, as you said, over the next two months to put the details around all that. But our long term guidance of this 3% to 5%, 4% to 6% sort of EBITDA growth is \u2013 we've been very public about our expectations and don't see changing that this morning.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I think that's good. And I guess the other thing I would add is, I think we have good visibility on Medicare, and we don't see any material changes in the Medicare revenue outlook.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, A. J.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Vic, maybe this is one for you, but any thoughts on additional states that you're in expanding Medicaid and how the outcome or different outcomes of the election might impact that?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Gary, I think most everyone would agree, if the Republicans gain control of the White House and what have you, there will be pressures and probably less opportunities for states to expand Medicaid. If the Democrats are in place there, I do believe that there will be consideration, hopefully. Maybe see some additional incentives, maybe a little more flexibility in bringing some states to bear. And you would hope that some of the states that haven't expanded Medicaid will look at this as, ACA is not going away. There's money there that can help our states and get people insured. So I'm not about to say every state goes, but I think you'll start to see some \u2013 hopefully, you'll start to see some movement.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Any states where you're more optimistic than others?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","You know what, it's hard to point out states. I mean, I sit here in Tennessee and I'm hoping Tennessee will go there because I know at one point our governor tried and, again, you've got the issues \u2013 not only the governors don't have total control but you had a Republican governor here that would've liked to expand it and his state legislature wasn't going to let him do it. You would hope that maybe the ball can move there, and there are half a dozen other states that might be in similar positions that might consider it.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, good morning. Sam, you talked about inpatient demand up 2% in your market, and I was just curious what you would project for adjusted admission growth given that \u2013 with that number? And can you give us your view on the sustainability of your 20 or 30 basis points of market share gains target as you go into 2017, given your earlier comment here? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","As I indicated, Justin, the outpatient side of the equation we think is growing slightly faster than the inpatient died and we've estimated over time that there's maybe 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% zone as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions.","Obviously, the emergency room is a big piece of that. Outpatient surgery is the second-largest piece of that component, and then it drops off from there where it's not as segmented as those two, when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically, you're correct. We've tended to average 25-40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our business, as I indicated in my commentary, and then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated.","So we're having to up our game. And that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamics that have taken place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great ideas from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy, and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward.","It's really difficult for me to say how one year, the next year's going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do, but largely our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think that could be some incremental movement from one market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that. And I think we are. And we're doing everything we possibly can to sustain that kind of performance.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Sam, you gave some comments earlier about the different regions, butt I was \u2013 10 out of 14 with positive growth \u2013 but any other more detailed geographical color, parts of the country that are doing better or worse? And then, any parts of the country where you're seeing any pressure on these supplemental payment programs? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam, you want one? And Bill, two.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I think the statistical challenges that we've had with admissions and so forth were somewhat acute in East Florida division and the West Florida division. But that was mostly attributable to the Medicare Advantage observation issue. The number of patients in our hospitals in both of those divisions were up when I bundle the two. But when it comes to admission statistics, then it obviously looks like those two divisions had challenges. When we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue.","When you look at Texas compared the Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up, but Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets, because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plans when previously they weren't in certain health plans. So we've seen some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all-in-all, a 10 out of 14 is very good.","And just on the admission side to give some perspective, the four that were down, one of them was down 0.5%, one was down 1% \u2013 this is admissions \u2013 one was down 1.5% and one was down 3%. The one that was down 3% had the most Medicare Advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, one of them was down 0.2%, one was down 0.4%, and one was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number. So that's part of how we're looking at it, Frank, and we don't see anything unique in any one particular market that's really compromising the company in any significant way.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","And Bill, you want to take...","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, just real quick. You know our largest supplemental payment program is in Texas with the Texas Waiver program. That is scheduled to continue through December 2017. I know there's ongoing discussion between the state and HHS how that may be adjusted post December 2017. It's too early for us to call, but it looks like it's stable through next year.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Question on capital deployment. You have cash flows remain really strong. You're getting $750 million from Oklahoma. What do you see in terms of where acquisitions for next year, what areas? And then, how are you thinking about returning capital back to investors, both buybacks and the possibility of a dividend? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Bill, do you want to lead on that?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Sure, Brian. Well, we're at that time of the year when we're working on our plans and, as mentioned in my comments, we'll finish our current $3 billion dollar share repurchase authorization by the end of this year and we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations, probably be somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year. As we think about that cash and the allocation of the capital, the first thing we do is reinvested back in our existing markets. And this year, that'll probably be about $2.7 billion. I would expect next year would be a similar amount, maybe up a little bit, but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously we could use for acquisitions.","We always have a pipeline. We're looking for opportunities. Most recently, those acquisition opportunities have been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or in outpatient acquisitions like urgent care that Sam's talked about. We'll probably continue to see those opportunities into next year we'll be obviously well-positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic we'll have some good opportunities. But as you know from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen.","But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capability to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that leaves us then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think any of these are mutually exclusive. I mean, I think if you look at HCA, we've had a very diversified approach to our capital allocation. I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation and we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017.","We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. If we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue, I think, to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years since we've been public again. And it's been, I think, a great return on investment for our shareholders. So that's how we think about it, and we'll have more details on exactly what we'll do in 2017 when we have our fourth quarter call and release our 2017 guidance.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thank you. Maybe just if you can comment on the Medicare Advantage observation issue, how that's come up. Has it been specific to one payer or one or two payers or has it been across the board? What do you think has triggered that and how you're dealing with it?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Matt. I think, Sam, you want that one?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yes. The issue is more than one payer. That's the first point and it's more than one market. It's mainly in the Florida markets, like I said, but we have seen situations like this before in other markets in Texas. And I think you have to deal with it on really three ways. One, we have to work with the payers to come up with a process that doesn't put us in a situation where we're disputing each other's classification of patients. And we're doing that. We're having active dialogue with payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues seeing if we can find resolution there.","The second thing we can do where we disagree, we dispute and go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocols and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation.","The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts, but others it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it. But those are some of the approaches and we continue to work through those in this particular situation that we have, primarily in Florida.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. I don't think I've heard much of an update around the HCA's physician strategy in some time and I think you aligned with some medical schools in the past year, particularly in Florida. Just curious if there is any new strategy around physicians, G&E programs, anything new that you're developing that you can share?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam, you want that one?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","The physician strategy for the company I think has evolved significantly over the past five or six years where we have grown our active medical staff, Whit, by about 2% to 2.5% per year. We have roughly 38,000 physicians who are active participants on HCA's medical staff across all of our entities. Of those 38,000, about 4,000-plus are employed by the company, a split between primary care and specialists in that particular category. But what we have done structurally is evolved our approach to interacting with our physicians and providing them voice in our facilities, creating efficient and clinically capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that meets their objectives. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach.","We have evolved, as I indicated, over the five years, and we believe it makes sense in a lot of our markets to advance medical education training. And we have added graduate medical education programs across the company over the last year and we will continue to invest in additional graduate medical education programs. That is providing opportunity for us to respond to market needs where there are physician shortages. It's also creating opportunities for us to improve our operations within our facilities. And then finally, it's addressing potential strategic issues and allowing us to generate physicians who can support our service line development and our overall growth agenda.","So we're very excited about where we are with our graduate medical education program. We have consolidated that division into our Physician Services Group under Mike Cuffe, who has deep experiences with that. And he and his team are working to bring about best practices to create academic curriculum that can be scaled across the organization. And we think this is going to be a unique model that makes for a very competitive and responsive graduate medical education solution for many individuals who want to go down this path.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Whit. Couple more questions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So my question is on the other two components of your growth model. The volumes you say are 2% but looks like the mix shifting to lower-priced service sites is going quite aggressively, and there's price discounting with mandatory bundling. What are you thinking about on pricing growth? And then on sustainability of bad debt, which was a pretty important component of your growth for this year?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Bill, you want to start.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I'll give it a start. So our pricing, if you look at our revenue per equivalent admission, has been very stable over the past quarters and years. We anticipate 2% to 3% growth of NRAA, we saw 2.7% this quarter, and it's fairly consistent for the past several quarters.","So as Milton mentioned, we've got pretty good visibility into our contracting position for next year. Couple that with our program investments, I think that's a good stable range for HCA. Bundle payments is being initiated. We participate in that, but it's not yet really a material factor that alters kind of the revenue profile for HCA at this stage, but I think we'll continue to see more of that going forward.","And on bad debts, our uncompensated care trends have also remained very stable. You look at our uninsured volume trends for this quarter, 5% on a year-to-date basis, which is lower really where we anticipated them falling out at, in the high single digits. So I really characterize that overall environment for HCA as very stable.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Good. Thanks, Bill.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you for the color.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry, had to find the phone. Thank you. Maybe just as a little bit of a follow-on, I just wanted to ask about your view on sustainability of margins. I think you began the year, you upped your long-term EBITDA growth forecast of 4% to 7%, but now we've had a few quarters where the revenue alone is at the lower end of that. And to get into that EBITDA growth forecast, you'd have to see some margin expansion, which seems difficult with revenue at the low end. So can you just talk about your view of sustainability of the company's current margins as you move out the next couple years?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Gary. Milton?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yes, I'll make a couple comments. Bill may have some thoughts too. Gary, as you know, looking at our margins over the last several years, it's been very stable, somewhere around the high-teens level, close to 19%, or above 20%. And so right now we are near 20% and we're running at the low end of our revenue expectation, which is, say, in that 4% to 6% range.","So I'm very, very pleased with the team's execution in terms of this quarter to have EBITDA growth just under 8% off just over 4% net revenue growth is a real, I think, compliment to the execution. I want to give that compliment to the team.","I think as we go forward, that's kind of the outlook we have. We think in this sort of inflationary environment that we're in, if we can grow revenue \u2013 if we're at the low end of our expectation, our goal is to maintain margins. If we can move to the high end, we think there could be some good opportunity for margin growth.","From time to time, we're making investments for the future, we're investing in programs like trauma. We're investing in physician programs that Sam's touched on. And a lot of those investments have to run through the P&L and not just on the balance sheet. And so we'll make \u2013 we have been making those investments. They're in the run rate, and we're going to continue to make those, because really it's our future and it's going to allow us to continue to grow.","So from time to time we may move around a little bit with that, but I feel like as an objective and a long-term outlook, I think our margins are at a very good level, but I think if we can grow our revenue at the high end, there's still some opportunity, I think, for margin growth.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Milton. We have time for one last question.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi there, folks. Two quick questions on your managed care contracting trends. Was interested in how much narrow network growth you're seeing and how important that's becoming going into 2017 for you?","And then comparably, what sort of increase are you seeing in your risk taking or capitation or other sorts of arrangements with managed care?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam, you want to conclude with this one?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","The narrow networking issue is most applicable to the exchange contracting and not to the overall broader commercial book. So exchange volume builds (57:13) about 2%, 2.5%. I would say a component of that, not all of that, is connected to narrow networking and those type of structures. And that's not really gaining ground significantly on the larger commercial book.","With respect to the company taking risk and so forth, we do have some elements of risk taking, it's predominantly on a physician practice side and not on the hospital side of the business. So it's a very small piece of the company's overall revenue. But more inside of our physician component than it is inside of our hospital component. And that's where our contracts are really positioned in the next two to three years, and that seems to be what our payers are asking of us and what we think is right for the company. So.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Sam, thank you. Lance, appreciate it.","Victor L.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell","Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call, as well as those of you listening on our webcast. With me here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And then we have a number of other members of our senior management team here as well to assist during the Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.","Richard M. Bracken","Okay. Thank you, Vic, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Earlier this morning, the company reported its second quarter earnings results, which are in line with our purview of earnings release of July 16. Summary information concerning our second quarter performance was provided in today's release and will offer more detailed review of the second quarter performance in just a moment.","But first, I want to comment on the announcement we issued Monday afternoon. In it, we indicated that at the end of this year, I'll retire from the role of CEO. But more importantly, that Milton Johnson, whom you all know is our President and Chief Financial Officer, will become CEO effective at that same time. Let me just say that we are most fortunate to have Milton not only ready, willing and able to accept this responsibility, but he will also bring to the position a comprehensive understanding of the industry and investor community, a long-term appreciation of HCA and our culture and a competitive drive and ethical character to lead our organization in the futures. My congratulations in advance to Milton, and I look forward to supporting him and the entire management team to the Chairman's role.","Now a few general observations about the quarter. In short, we were pleased with the results of the second quarter. A modest increase in volumes, an increase in patient acuity and resultant revenues per visit, combined with an efficient cost structure, produced favorable results. Revenues increased 4.2% and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% compared to the same period of the prior year. Patient volumes for the second quarter, as expressed in same facility admissions, increased 1.3%, while same facility adjusted admissions increased 1.1%. Generally, if we adjusted the first quarter volumes for the leap year effect, second quarter volume growth rates are similar to the first quarter. More on volumes in just a moment.","As I mentioned, we were able to achieve favorable earnings performance through a combination of improved service mix and, importantly, a significant improvement in our expense structure. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.8% over the prior year second quarter. As we discussed on our first quarter call, volumes began to slow in the second half of the first quarter, and when this trend was established, necessary steps were taken. The benefit of these management actions continued through the second quarter and assisted in producing our favorable results.","Through the first half of 2013, our overall results are consistent with our internal plan. As Sam will discuss in a moment, our most recent data indicates that our market share trends remain favorable. We remain comfortable with our operating strategies and our significant focus on development of service line capacities and improvement of patient quality and service metrics.","Relative to our asset profile, we have had some developments worth noting. Shortly after the end of the second quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the purchase of 3 hospitals in the Tampa, St. Pete markets. This acquisition will add approximately 700 beds and approximately $225 million in annualized revenues to our Tampa market.","Furthermore, and within the last week, we have opened 2 newly constructed hospitals in the growing suburbs of existing markets, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Salt Lake City. These new facilities that we are opening are smaller in comparison to our average hospital size and investment and will operate with an emphasis on outpatient services. We have 2 additional hospitals using the same design concept now under construction in the Houston and Fort Worth markets. Both are scheduled for completion in 2014.","We believe this approach will be a capital efficient way to stay aligned with population growth centers and provide access to our more comprehensive networks.","Also in the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of The Outsource Group. This is our first major acquisition for our Parallon enterprise. We believe this acquisition will be complementary to and augment the existing revenue cycle services provided by Parallon. Parallon now will be able to offer a full spectrum of services ranging from targeted point solutions to end-to-end full service revenue outsourcing for hospitals and physician organizations. A broader array of solutions now will be available to both Parallon and The Outsource Group's significant client base. We welcome the 1,400 new employees from The Outsource Group to our Parallon organization.","And finally, regarding health care reform, there are no major developments to report since our last quarter, although we did find a few additional exchange contracts since our last call. Now, 90% of our hospitals are contracted with at least 1 exchange product, up from 85% as reported in the first quarter. We don't expect any material impact on HCA from the delay in implementation of the important mandate and as most provider organizations, we are developing our strategies to participate in the exchange enrollment process for the uninsured. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","Thank you, and good morning to all. Let me begin my comments this morning by thanking Richard for his leadership and countless contributions to HCA success. I'm looking forward to our continued relationship as you transition to Chairman next year.","I'm also grateful to our outstanding management teams across our markets and our corporate leadership team for their support. I understand the unique role HCA plays in the U.S. health care delivery system. I'm excited, as well as humbled, by the opportunity that lies ahead. As CEO, I will reinforce the mission and values of HCA, including our focus on improving patient experience and outcomes, while maintaining a culture of operational excellence and accountability for results.","Now let's move to a discussion of the second quarter. I hope most of you have had a chance to review our second quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding the second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions.","We were extremely pleased with the second quarter results, which were the product of solid volumes, better than expected revenue unit growth attributable to increase in acuity and excellent expense management by operating management teams. As Richard mentioned, after the first 6 months of 2013, we are right on plan for the year. Of course, it hasn't been achieved exactly as expected, but after a difficult first quarter, we are now back on plan.","Revenues in the second quarter increased to $8.45 billion, up 4.2% compared to the prior year second quarter driven by both volume increases and revenue per unit growth.","Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.689 billion compared to $1.569 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of 2012.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $423 million, or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $391 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter volume trends were consistent with the first quarter after adjusting for the effect of leap year in the first quarter of 2012, with same facility admissions increasing 1.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 1.1% as compared to last year second quarter. Our same facility medical admissions increased 1.8%, while same facility surgical admissions declined 0.6% compared to the prior year.","During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 10% on a same facility basis and now represent 29.1% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 1.8% from the prior year, while same facility Medicaid equivalent admissions increased 2% compared to the prior year period.","Same facility managed care and other admissions declined 1.4% in the second quarter, while same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions declined 2% compared to the prior year second quarter.","In the second quarter, uninsured admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 8.1% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.7% in last year second quarter.","Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.8% in the quarter. However, excluding the decline in pulmonary or flu-related volumes in the quarter, ER visits would have increased 2.6% over the prior year.","Same facility surgeries increased 0.1% in the quarter, reflecting a 0.2% increase in our same facility inpatient surgeries, while our same facility outpatient surgeries were flat with the prior year.","During the quarter, revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.9% on a same facility basis. This is partially due to an increase in our average length of stay in our case mix, a measure of inpatient acuity. Average length of stay increased 0.7% and the case mix index increased 1.6% compared to the prior year period. For the second quarter, higher Medicare case mix index helped to mitigate the approximately $30 million impact of the BCA sequester, resulting in a decline of 0.2% in same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 6.3%. Medicaid case mix index increased 2.8% over the prior period.","Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission reflected solid growth at 6.1% over the prior year period. Managed care and other case mix index increased 2% over last year.","Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $461 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. During the quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $796 million, an increase of $65 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.014 billion, an increase of $396 million from the prior year period.","Now moving to expenses. Expense management was excellent in the second quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased just 1.8% compared to the prior year. Excluding HITECH and the Medicaid waiver program expenses, same facility operating expense increased 2.6% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year period.","Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% on a same facility basis, and same facility productivity performance, as measured by man hours per equivalent admission, deteriorated 0.5% over the prior year period, and same facility wage rate growth was 1.5% in the second quarter.","Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased $13 million, or 4.9% from the previous year second quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter over last year second quarter.","Same facility supply expense for equivalent admission increased 2% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from our reduction in supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $37 million and contributed 260 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the second quarter. The reclassification had no impact on the adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.","Same facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.6% from the prior year period. We recognized $52 million in electronic health record and incentive income in the second quarter compared to $70 million in the second quarter of last year, and this is consistent with our expectations.","The company also incurred approximately $33 million and $20 million in EHR-related expenses in the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively.","Cash flows from operating activities totaled $814 million in the quarter compared to $1.46 billion last year. The $646 million decline was primarily due to a favorable benefit in 2012 from a decline in accounts receivable of approximately $390 million, which included the receipt of $271 million related to the 2012 first quarter rural floor Medicare settlement.","Also we paid $245 million in additional income tax payments in the current quarter compared to the prior year period.","Days and accounts receivable for second quarter increased by 1 day to 53 days compared to 52 days at the end of the first quarter.","At June 30, 2013, the company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.41x compared to 4.56x at March 31, 2013.","Our exposure to floating rate debt is approximately 10% of our total debt. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.985 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","Before turning the call to Sam, I want to mention Parallon's implementation that both supply chain and revenue cycle services for LifePoint Hospitals is proceeding well and according to plan.","Now let me turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter and then provide an update on inpatient market share.","8 out 14 domestic divisions had growth in year-over-year same facility inpatient admissions. Our international division also had growth in inpatient admissions. 9 out of 14 domestic divisions and our international division had growth in same facility adjusted admissions. Overall, the growth inside our portfolio of domestic hospitals was similar to the first quarter. In the second quarter, 60% of our domestic hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions and 57% had growth in adjusted admissions.","As Milton indicated, emergency room visits were soft in comparison to past trends. Only 6 out 14 domestic divisions had growth in emergency room visits. EMS transports to our hospitals were up almost 1%, with 8 out of 14 divisions growing. We have seen a general softness in the lower acuity emergency room business, and there has been some increased competition in a number of markets. We feel these 2 factors are part of the reasons for the slower growth rates. The company continues to invest significantly in the service line to increase accessing capacity, to improve operational efficiency and to enhance quality and service. All of this, we believe, positions us well from a competitive standpoint in today's market and into the future.","Total surgeries for the company were up slightly in the quarter, with hospital-based surgeries up 1.1% on a same facility basis, and our ambulatory surgery division down 2.3%. This is a good improvement over the first quarter.","Inside our ambulatory surgery division, overall cases, which include certain endoscopic and pain management procedures that are not counted in our surgery volumes, grew by 4% as a result of some recent acquisitions and new facility development.","As indicated, acuity this past quarter was strong. Average length of stay in our adult and neonatal intensive care units was up 2.7%. This continues at similar trend we experienced in the first quarter.","Behavioral services admissions were up 2.6%, and acute rehabilitation admissions were up 11.3% in the quarter. These metrics are generally consistent with the first quarter.","And finally, deliveries were up 1 point -- up 1%, and the first quarter deliveries were down 1%.","Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ending December 2012. Once again, this is the most current data available for the company, and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets.","First, the company's inpatient market share during 2012 increased 56 basis points to 23.7%. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets increased in 2012 by 0.4%. This is a slight weakening from 2011, which had market demand growth of 0.8%. Inpatient demand, however, in the fourth quarter of 2012, was up 1.1%, reflecting a busy flu season. Sequentially, market share increased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. This follows sequential market share gains in each of the previous 5 quarters. We gained market share in 14 out of 17 service lines. HCA had market share gains in 29 out of 37 markets, with growth in 9 of our top 10 earnings markets. Market share in both the commercial and in migration segments of our business grew, reflecting continued success with our outreach efforts in these 2 distinct markets.","Across all of these market share metrics, the company's trends are generally consistent with past reports. This pattern reflects solid execution of our growth agenda.","As you already heard, expense management in the second quarter was very strong. Our management teams executed very effectively. We will remain focused in the last half of the year on the same areas that we shared with you during our first quarter earnings call and we believe these efforts should put us in a good position to maintain our cost structure in the last 2 quarters of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell","All right, thanks, Sam. All right, now I'd like to for you to come back on, encourage everyone, as we always do, to try to hold your questions to just one at a time so that everyone has an opportunity. With that, Noah?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give us an update, there's been a ton of news on public M&A recently, 2 deals announced. But even outside that, just wanted to get your thoughts on what the M&A pipeline looks like and if you had a chance to evaluate any of these deals and your thoughts on them?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Milt, do you want to address that?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. I don't think we should address comments on the M&A activity in the public traded market right now as those transactions are still ongoing and incomplete. But overall, as Richard mentioned, we have signed some agreements to pursue acquisitions in our existing markets, we like that approach, they help round out in existing markets, improve our position in markets. We have transactions that are pending, subject to regulatory approval in both Kansas City and, as Richard mentioned this morning, in Tampa. We're looking at some other opportunities that would be similar. Too early to tell whether those will work out and lead to an agreement. But we are actively pursuing acquisitions in the markets where it makes sense to us. We think that's a strategy that we will continue and excited about the opportunities. But as you all know, those opportunities for acquisitions tend to come and go in the marketplace at a certain pace. And we certainly are tuned to the market and looking forward to participating where it makes sense to us.","Richard M. Bracken","I just add -- this is Richard. I would just add that we still think that given health care reform and over the longer view that there will be consolidation in the industry, we think our platform allows us to participate very efficiently in that process. As we've said many times in the past, we are disciplined about where we acquire, how we acquire. And so, that will be our thinking as we assess possibilities. The pipeline, specifically to your question, is unpredictable. It happens when it happens. We generally are aware of most things that are going on in the marketplace and consider them. But short of that, we are pleased with our efforts to date. We add that to a strong position where there's organic growth in markets, and we think we have a pretty good growth story going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk to the improved earnings from a geographic perspective, if any markets jumped out. And maybe, specifically, comment on Las Vegas. There's been some discussion that that\u2019s starting to sees an improvement? And I guess the last part of my first question is that in Vegas, if there's any thoughts around renewed discussions with the largest commercial payor there?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, do you want Vegas?","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes, there was more than one question there. Let me start with the geographic performance of the company. We had a very balanced performance across the organization. We had many markets that performed better than planned. So for the most part, the performance across the portfolio in general was very balanced, with most markets accomplishing what we had hoped they would accomplish in the second quarter. We had a few markets where there were some struggles. But they weren't material, and we were able to overcome those with the ones that did perform well. It's important to understand, for HCA, Las Vegas represents maybe 5% of the company's earnings. And so from that standpoint, it's an important market, yes, but it's not a market that dictates the overall performance of the company. Having said that, Las Vegas performance this year and last year has been very strong for HCA. We have seen reasonable market share gains over the time period. I think in 2012, we picked up decent market share in Las Vegas and our financial performance has been solid because of a very disciplined approach given the economic pressures that exist in that market and some of the underfunding that exist within the Medicaid program. As it relates to the largest payor, as a routine, we do have discussions with them. We haven't at this particular point in time, reached any agreement that would reestablish relationships between HCA and Sierra inside of that market, but we do have ongoing discussions given our long tenured relationship with them.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","In terms of reform, just curious if you have any updated thoughts, I know you said nothing major changed in terms of exchange contracts and whatnot, but just updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the benefits as we look out, I guess, either specifically or directionally in sort of the ramp that you're thinking at this stage of the game? And when you might think that you're going to give us any more specifics on that topic?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Thanks, Tom. I think Milton is going to address that.","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Well, as Richard said, it's really not a lot of change in our outlook since last quarter. I'll maybe describe it this way, the uncertainty of health care reform, there's 2 main drivers where we still have a great deal of uncertainty. One, and to your question, what's going to be the ramp-up or the uptake on health care reform? In other words, how many -- at what rate and how many of the uninsured will sign up for coverage in the exchanges. That's a significant uncertainty for us. And then second, of those that do come into the marketplace and go into the exchange, how many will recapture? What would be our market share in the exchange? Are the payors which we have contracts with, how successful will those contracts be in capturing share? Those are 2 main drivers, of course, of health care reform impact on HCA, and we need some more time to try to get some clarification around that impact. And once we have that, I think we will factor that in. And as far as timing, right now, we want to keep flexibility with respect to the timing. Only we plan to give guidance on the health care reform impact. But right now, I would say, it would be no later, we think, than when we give guidance for 2014, which is expected most likely to be in February of 2014.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","To be able to hit your same-store equivalent admission guidance number of 1% to 2%, you need to see a bit of a pickup in the back half of the year to offset the weaker volumes we saw in Q1. How confident are you that you're going to be able to see that pickup in the back half of the year?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, do you want to address that as well?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Good observation there. Although we're still -- we are reaffirming our guidance and, as I said, we are on plan with respect to our EBITDA guidance. With respect to the details of how we may arrive there, now that we're halfway through the year, I think that it's more likely that our adjusted admission growth for the year will be somewhere around 1% versus previously, I think, we'd guided or given details somewhere around 2%. Here it's halfway through the year, we're up 0.3%. And as I think about the overall revenue growth, I still think we'll be in that 3% to 5%, 3% to 4.5%, 3% to 5% zone as we stated before, because I expect that our net revenue per adjusted admission growth rate will also be higher than we first thought. We -- in May, we said it would be 2% to 3% on our call. Now I'm thinking more likely in the 2.5% to 3.5% sort of growth rate, making up the shortfall from the change in outlook on our volume growth. Year-to-date, we are about -- we're at 3.6% growth. That excludes, of course, the 2012 rural floor settlement out of the first quarter of last year in that growth rate. And then we still think our expenses for the year will come in, in that 3% to 3.5% sort of zone. In the first quarter, our expense growth, excluding HITECH expenses, grew 4.8%, and we're up 2.6% here in the second quarter. And that averages out to about 3.7%. So we still think our expense targets of 3% to 3.5% for the year is still reasonable targets. So our revenue, total top line revenue outlook is still the same in that 3% to 5% zone. But getting there, a little bit different mix between volume and revenue growth than we talked about in May.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just want to get a little more color on the exchange contract, I appreciate the color to 90% from 95% with 1 contract. But in the past you talked about the number of markets that have more than 1 contract, and going back to your point before about one of the unknowns being how much of that incremental coverage you will capture within your facilities, what is a good number of contracts to have in a given market as you think about it? Is one going to be sufficient? Is there a goal to get a certain number more than one in most markets?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Kevin, I'm going to ask Juan Vallarino, I don't -- we really don't have the stats down because the numbers didn't change a whole lot from the previous quarter when we sort of walked through how many markets and contracts, whatever. And we sort of looked at that and, I'd say, no material change there other than 85% of our hospitals with the contract. We are at 90%. But Juan Vallarino is not here at Nashville, but I think he's on an outside line. Juan, you just want to share anything that you can because there's not a lot of specifics.","Juan Vallarino","Sure. Kevin, good question. Honestly, more contract is better in any market. I think the first year of the exchange, you are not going to know a whole lot so premiums get published from the health plans. The plans that you do have business with where they lie in terms with premiums as opposed to their competitors. And to date, only 2 of the states where we do visits in their published premiums. And they're still both under review. So we know very little today as anybody else both on the planning side or the hospital side about the potential grab of market share in the exchange. So right now, it's really a wait and see and try to get more contracts but knowing that their premiums are set already.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to change gears a bit and find out what's the latest thinking on capital deployment. Obviously, some M&A and development going on, but just bigger picture, what you're thinking about doing with your cash over the balance of the year?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Richard and Milt, you want to handle that one?","Richard M. Bracken","I wouldn't think that our position has changed from what we have shared with you in the past. We take a look at our cash flow and obviously after our CapEx, I will say this, we do see opportunities for perhaps increasing our CapEx sum. There are a lot of opportunities for growth within our markets. And we are evaluating those as we speak. So I do think there's some opportunity for some CapEx increases as we go forward. We continue to obviously, as you mentioned, to rate strategic acquisitions as a very high priority use. And as we just mentioned, we've been doing that. And then of course the other uses of cash are to be considered after those 2. And I really don't see that lineup changing anytime soon.","Operator","We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Richard, I want to wish you the best in the future. Obviously, we have one more quarter with you, but do that, and also congratulations to Milton. Just to pick up on Milton's sort of walk-through to the back half of the year. Obviously, the 2 variables that have changed since your original guidance seemed like to me to be favorable are the cost-cutting efforts you put in place in -- at the end of Q1. I guess I'm curious whether that's fully reflected at this point in Q2 or would there be some residual benefits that will kick into Q3 that may make that walk forward seem a little conservative? And then I guess you had the DSH proposal as well come out more favorable, and I don't know what you think that will look like in the final rule, if you that any insight, I guess, will get that any day here, but that would -- those 2 would seem to suggest that analysis might have some upside to it. Is there any comment on that?","Victor L. Campbell","Let me do the DSH and then I'll let these guys talk about the cost-cutting and how it rolls, Sam, you probably want to do that. I think DSH, we know what you know. We've seen the proposed rule, and we would expect the final rule very soon within the next few days. But we know nothing more than that, and we'll wait until we see a final.","Samuel N. Hazen","AJ, it's Sam. I think the company moved really timely in the first quarter of making adjustments once we sense that volumes weren't where they were going to be. And most of those efforts around our adjustments to costs were accomplished in the first quarter and benefited the second quarter. There's -- were some residual efforts that occurred throughout the second -- part of the second quarter, if you will, that will have some incremental benefit as we move forward. Again, our cost performance depends heavily on our volume, and as we achieve where we think our volumes are going to be, as Milton indicated, we believe the cost structure is in a pretty good position. Having said that, we have a host of cost initiatives across the company that can produce some incremental value month in and month out and they're centered around supply chain initiatives, ongoing sharing of best practices through our process improvement teams, clinical excellence initiatives that yield improvements in performance across the company. So those things continue to yield value and will bleed in as those initiatives get executed. But for the most part, the substantial adjustments that we needed to make were accomplished in the first quarter. And we won't see the same kind of adjustments today that we had at that point in time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you guys mentioned in your plan to participate in enrolling patients in exchange of the Medicaid. Can you provide us maybe some more details on your strategy around that, are you going to formalize it by being an affixer or a navigator, maybe just remind us of how successful you guys are, generally, today in enrolling people in Medicaid and maybe even high risk goals?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Andrew, thank you. Eric Ward who is with Parallon. Eric, do you want to talk a little bit about that?","Eric Ward","Sure. Today, our process for enrolling patients in Medicaid is a combination of in-company resources and vendor resources. As we move forward into the future with the exchanges, we continue to think we're going to use both resources from an outsource perspective and insource perspective to enroll people in the exchanges. We're working with our vendors today and are monitoring to see where we need to go in the future.","Victor L. Campbell","If I could add. We have a pretty successful component of conversion today. I mean, we monitor our conversions on Medicaid very closely. We benchmark against our vendors. And we think those lessons will apply as we move through exchange enrollment as well. And Eric and his team have a very robust set of metrics and systems underneath all of those efforts that give us confidence that we can use those same approaches, and hopefully, get the same kind of results as we move through the exchange. The difference though is you get retroactive approvals on Medicaid. We don't think we'll be able to get retroactive approvals on the exchange.","Richard M. Bracken","And let me just add. This is Richard. As we think about enrolling folks in the exchanges, there certainly is crossover with the skill set of the employees that are enrolling people in Medicaid as we speak. And so, as we look forward, there's opportunities to be, what's that, a training organization. We're certainly interested in that, so that we can use existing employee resources when we in-source to not only do Medicaid, but to do the exchange products or to the HCA and then also outsource where we need to supplement. So we think we have a pretty good plan. This is all developed -- this is in process as we speak right now and really will unfold over the next 30 to 60 days.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Want to go back to the volume side of things. Can you share any opinion you have on just the overall environment? We've seen more pronounced volatility between, certainly, at least the publicly traded group over the last several quarters. I guess do you have any sense or take on kind of the urban versus rural characteristics, volatility between markets and just general landscape? And along those lines, it will be helpful to get your take on a long-term basis, just remind us what you -- what kind of same facility revenue growth you think you can achieve and the underlying EBITDA growth that would translate to, maybe extra form.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Ralph, that was pretty good, 1 question, became at least 3. I'm not sure we get to that last one anytime on this call, but you want to start out, we'll just talk about volume, Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes. I think one thing, and we've said this for years and we still believe that it's relevant to the discussion is that HCA has a unique portfolio of markets where it does business. And when you look at population trends and you look at the economic performance of this market, it's unique, I think, across the industry. And that's part of why we believe we have maybe different volume metrics in some respects than others. Having said that, we think our organic growth strategies are effective in yielding market share gains as we've talked about with a pretty strong market share gain performance over the past few years, and so there's execution also that we believe is yielding some inherent growth. As it relates to the urban, rural, the only point of reference I can give you is we monitor what we call the in-migration of business from the rural markets into these major metropolitan markets. And that segment of our business is the fastest-growing segment of admission activity on the inpatient side. The composite growth in 2012 was actually 2.8%. And as I indicated, for 2012, overall inpatient demand was only 0.4%. So you can see that at least in rural markets surrounding HCA's urban markets, there is a growing in-migration volume that's taking place, and that's why we're so focused on rural outreach in efforts to affiliate with rural providers to drive growth for HCA. I don't remember the other questions, Vic.","Victor L. Campbell","I think that was the primary one. And Milton, I don't know if you want to talk x reform, how we're looking at it.","R. Milton Johnson","Well, just -- let me just maybe look where we are year to date, there's some moving parts in the numbers. Let me just kind of real quickly walk-through and kind of get down to what we think is a normalized EBITDA growth, at least where we are through the first 6 months. So on a reported basis, all in, our EBITDA is down 4%. Where this year, you were at $3.257 billion for the first 6 months versus last year at $3.392 billion. But of course last year, we had the favorable rural floor settlement that was a net $170 million in EBITDA. If you back that out, then we're actually up 1.1% for the first 6 months. And then, if you consider HITECH, the impact of our HITECH income and expenses impact from EBITDA, so we've got less revenue from HITECH as you know in the first 6 months of this year and we had spent a little bit more on HITECH expenses rolling out the program this year. The net effect on EBITDA is that this time last year, we had a drag of -- I'm sorry, an impact of $88 million positive this time last year because of the HITECH revenue. And this year, we have a positive impact of $32 million into EBITDA. So if you normalize that, we're 3.3% up. And so, we're in that kind of low to mid single-digit range, which is kind of where we expected when you normalize for these moving parts, HITECH and the Medicare adjustment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to go back to the commentary around ER volumes, a little bit of softness there. Could you go back and explain a little bit about what you saw there? I think you may have said increased competition for lower acuity services, just wanted to clarify on that. And then any commentary on the geography of that trend in ER volumes and does it mirroring the rural hospital volumes?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Sam, would you like to take that from Frank?","Samuel N. Hazen","We look at our ER business inside of the different levels of acuity. And we've talked about some of the acuity levels in past calls. And when we look at our business -- and really the first half of this year, but in particular, the second quarter of 2013, we actually had a decline in the lower level, the lowest levels of acuity, and that was fairly broad-based across the company. But we did have slower rates of growth in the other levels of ER volume, except for our most acute component of the ER business where we actually had faster rates of growth there than we had in the first 6 months of the last year as a comparison. When we look at the geography for our performance, we performed better in Florida, in the East Florida and West Florida in particular, on emergency room business. We think the tourist business in Florida has been stronger this year than in the past, and that's part of the explanation, but we do have a very robust emergency room growth plan across most of our markets. And that's yielding reasonable growth in other parts of the country. For example, in California, last year we struggled with emergency room activity. This year, we're actually having a very strong level of performance in the emergency rooms in California. There are increased competitors in both the urgent care space, as well as the emergency room space in a lot of our markets, whether that's coming from hospitals or freestanding entities, and we think that is yielding some pressure on the overall demand in this particular area. Having said that, we're still very bullish on our emergency room strategy. We believe there are opportunities to continue to differentiate in the market and gain market share and be a key part of access to the HCA system. And we're investing in capacity. In certain markets, we are investing in different sites. In certain markets, we are adding program capabilities across the company with trauma and stroke capabilities, which are important to other aspects of our business. We reach out very effectively with our EMS partners and work to resolve their problems. So we've got a lot going on in this area, and we still believe it's going to be a very needed service across a lot of our markets. And we don't know if this is a trend yet. It could be. But we think the aspects of this business will continue to yield solid growth, and we don't want to take our eye off the ball off this area.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe go back on some of the questions around volumes. Is there any way to quantify the impact, if any, that new services or changes in service lines had on same-store admissions?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, do you want to?","Samuel N. Hazen","I'm not sure exactly, Gary, what specific certifications you're talking about. I think that's such an ongoing effort with our facilities to gain accreditation where we meet certain quality standards and community standards. And that does have an impact, and that's a very good process for us because it forces discipline around performance and outcomes and so forth. But given that, that's happening on such a routine, I don't think it's incrementally changing the volume trends within the company. There are certain service lines where we add capacity and we do it and add capability because we don't have that service in a particular market, I'll use Nashville as an example. Our network in Nashville is very solid with geographical positioning and general capabilities. But a few years ago, we felt we did not have the full array of services to really accomplish what we wanted to accomplish as a network. And we've added more substantial children services, as an example. We're just opening up a level 2 trauma program, and that helps to round out the overall array of services in our market here in Nashville and makes us more competitive with respect to payors. It also attracts higher capability from a specialty standpoint. It really enhances our position in the communities. So those things are going on in multiple markets across the company and are incrementally there. But I wouldn't say they substantially change the overall performance of the company's volume metrics.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask just about the hospitals that you're opening. You made the comment of just about the design with a little bit more focus on outpatient and a smaller inpatient footprint, I guess, is the implied comment there. And maybe just stepping back if you could give us a sense for what that might mean for your capital plan going forward and your existing hospital base. Obviously, you've done a lot over time to configure your hospitals. But might we see a little bit of a different shift in how you're spending and how does that play into CapEx over the next couple of years?","Samuel N. Hazen","Let me speak to the size of the hospitals and then someone else could jump in here on the capital as we need to fill. This is Sam again. These hospitals are in demographics in major metropolitan markets where there are opportunities to introduce an HCA facility and round out our network. As Richard mentioned, we usually start out with 40 to 60 beds, inpatient beds, as an example. And typically, you will see a younger population in these markets. So they're not demanding as much inpatient health care as you might in a market where there's a different kind of demographic. And so we'll start out with basic services on the outpatient areas, clearly emergency room capability, outpatient surgery, a lot of imaging, and then we'll have a lot of women services in those facilities because they're connected to a younger population and in our obstetric service line and so forth. But what's important is that they now are connected to a larger network and when there's a need for more sophisticated or tertiary service, we can work with our physicians and our other hospitals to transfer patients to more tertiary level hospitals and deliver the services that those folks need. Then over time, it grows. We add beds, we add services, we bring in new physicians, and we start to get the certifications that we just spoke about, and we put ourselves in a position where it becomes a much more substantial hospital, and they move to different levels of capability over time. And that life cycle can vary, it can be 10 years in some cases, it can be 5 in very unique cases. But it's typically a 10 to 20 years kind of cycle where these hospitals will move into a much more sophisticated level. But as it relates to these networks, they're very complementary and very helpful to rounding out those capabilities. And in addition to the 2 that Richard mentioned that are under construction, we're evaluating 2 to 3 other ones that we think make sense for us, and we will weave those into our capital plan as appropriate once we get through the due diligence on those analysis.","Richard M. Bracken","And I would just add that I wouldn't expect this to change the overall sort of distribution of how we spend our capital. We have had large projects come through the system in the past. They take different forms as they work their way through. But for the most part, I wouldn't see this as dramatically shifting the distribution of how we spend money within the company. We generally think of it sort of a facility percentage, a technology percentage. And with the one exception, I would think that perhaps, and as we mentioned on the Parallon acquisition, no, not particularly a CapEx comment, but we do see more opportunities around that space and cap investment in that space where we haven't, historically. So I just think maybe that's where it might shift some but not overall distribution.","R. Milton Johnson","I'll make this one last comment to wrap up. We have a very good process and discipline around our capital allocation process. Sam and Jon Foster and Chuck Hall operating teams are, of course, heavily involved in that. And one thing I think that we have done very well over recent years is being able to match our capital spending with capacity and growth opportunities. And I think our process is very good around that. It's flexible maybe to your point, depending on market dynamics. And going forward, I expect we'll continue to be very flexible and take advantage of the market opportunities.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Everyone, I thank everyone on the call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead.","Victor L. Campbell","Casey, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are President and CEO, Milton Johnson; our CFO, Executive VP, Bill Rutherford, his maiden voyage for the call, and welcome, Bill; Sam Hazen, our President of Operations; and several other members of HCA's senior management team are here as well.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded. As you heard, a replay will be available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","Thanks, Vic. And good morning to everyone joining us on our call this morning. Let me start by welcoming Bill Rutherford to the earnings call. As most of you know, Bill was named Chief Financial Officer effective January 1 and you'll hear from Bill later this morning.","I will start today by providing a few general thoughts on our fourth quarter performance, as well as some observations for the entire year. And then, following this, I have a few comments on health care reform, as well as 2014 guidance.","First, the fourth quarter. We were very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter. Due to the exceptional volume we experienced in last year's fourth quarter and the implementation of the 2-Midnight Rule in the fourth quarter of this year, we expected softer volume growth rates in the quarter. We were able to deliver EBITDA growth in excess of our internal expectations due to better than expected service mix that resulted in higher revenue rate per equivalent admission. This, along with solid performance in managing expenses in the quarter, resulted in adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.7%.","Much of my commentary for the quarter can be said for the year. The year 2013 was a year that we experienced softer volume growth trends compared to recent years for HCA. Softer volume trends were offset by higher acuity patients and focused expense management. Our operating team has done an excellent job of making appropriate adjustments to our cost structure to reflect the change in volume trends.","Adjusted EBITDA for 2013 of $6.574 billion increased 0.7% over 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $6.531 billion on a reported basis. However, adjusting for the $170 million net favorable Medicare settlement and recorded in the first quarter of 2012 and $120 million last HITECH incentive income in 2013 and an increase in noncash share-based compensation expense in 2013 of $57 million, adjusted EBITDA growth in 2013 would have increased by an additional 570 basis points.","In addition to our financial success in 2013, I want to highlight our continuing clinical quality improvement as well. HCA's aggregate performance on CMS core measures is above the 90th percentile. 110 HCA hospitals or 80% were recognized in 2013 by Joint Commission as top performers versus 33% of U.S. hospitals. And in 2014, we will continue to build our programs in patient safety, infection prevention and the use of electronic health records and clinical data for the highest quality and most efficient health care.","Before moving to 2014 guidance, I have a few general thoughts to share. I believe we are well positioned in our key markets as we start 2014. Our operating agendas are structured appropriately. They are focused and they are effective. Operationally, we are focused on patient volume growth, quality outcomes, improving patient service and efficiency in service delivery. We believe these are the key ingredients for success. In a moment, Bill will provide details on our 2014 guidance, including health care reform. But first, I will provide a few thoughts.","In this morning's earnings release, we provided guidance estimates for certain financial metrics, including the expected financial impact from the Affordable Care Act. Our adjusted EBITDA range is $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion for 2014. Included in our adjusted EBITDA guidance is a benefit from the Affordable Care Act in the range of 1% to 2% of adjusted EBITDA.","Let me make a few comments about our guidance for health care reform. Number one, many of us at HCA have worked diligently over many months in an attempt to model the adjusted EBITDA impact of health care reform for 2014 and beyond. Number two, which should come as no surprise, there continues to be many uncertainties for the key variables which will drive the financial impact of reform. Number three, the Medicare rate reductions we have been incurring since 2010 and that we will continue to incur as reform pay-fors are built into our core business run rate and are not included in the calculation of our 1% to 2% benefit range. And finally, let me just say that while I'd always hoped we could provide annual reform guidance for multiple years, there remained too many uncertainties for many of the key variables to do so. However, we remain optimistic that reform should contribute to additional growth rate for HCA over the longer term. And as we reflect upon all this, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the health care reform environment.","Before turning the call over to Bill, as you may know, yesterday, we announced the appointment of 3 new independent directors to our board. Also, as a result of the company's transition from a controlled company, 2 directors from each of our private equity sponsors stepped down from the board, leaving one director from each firm on the board. This transition is the result of the reduction in share ownership by our sponsors that occurred in 2013. I am looking forward to working with our new independent directors, as well as existing board members in the years ahead.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional details regarding the fourth quarter and 2013.","William B. Rutherford","Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everybody. I will cover some additional detail around the fourth quarter results, then I'll turn it over to Sam and he will provide commentary on our growth agenda and some market share information. I'll then come back and conclude with some remarks on our approach to health reform modeling and some additional detail on our 2014 guidance.","As Milton mentioned, we were very pleased with the quarter's results, especially given the strength of last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter results were driven by solid revenue growth, resulting from relatively stable volume trends and increased intensity of service, as well as excellent expense management by our operators.","Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to $8.836 billion, driven primarily by revenue per equivalent admission growth of 4.6%. Case mix, or the level of acuity of patients served in our facilities, increased 3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. We saw solid surgical volume in the quarter, while also seeing a reduction in lower acuity cases, such as pulmonary. And Sam will share some additional details on this.","In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.714 billion, an increase of 6.7% from the prior year. EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points to 19.4%. Volume trends in the quarter were below our recent trends. However, this was not surprising given the strength of last year's fourth quarter where same facility admissions grew 4.3% and equivalent admissions grew 5%. So this quarter did provide a difficult comp.","In the fourth quarter of this year, our same facility total admissions declined 1.8% over prior year and equivalent admissions declined 1%. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions declined 2.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 4.4% on a same facility basis and now represent 29.5% of our total Medicare admissions.","Let me take a moment here to comment on the 2-Midnight Rule. As you would expect, we have spent a considerable amount of time and effort on the implementation of this new rule, which became effective October 1, 2013. In addition to a significant amount of training, education and process redesign, we've implemented a new Medicare order form, worked diligently with our physicians and implemented tracking and monitoring processes. This new rule did have an impact on our reported Medicare and total admissions for the quarter.","Our decline in Medicare 1-day stays accounted for about 50 basis points of our total admission decline for the quarter. We'll continue to implement and monitor the impact of this new rule. And while it did and will likely continue to have an impact on our reported admission metrics, we do not believe it will have a material financial impact, as we were also able to eliminate some operating expenses associated with outside reviewer costs that have previously been incurred related to reviewing our short stay Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.6% in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year. Managed care admissions and equivalent admissions declined 3.8% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter on a same facility basis. And same facility emergency room visits declined 2.4% in the quarter. This was also against a difficult comp, as emergency room visits increased 12.7% in last year's fourth quarter.","Our softer volume was mostly in our lower acuity business. And this, coupled with continued surgical growth, helped drive stronger revenue intensity. Same facility revenue per equivalent admissions in the quarter increased a solid 4.8% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.3% in the fourth quarter, while Medicare case mix increased 3.3%. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.6%, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, while case mix increased 3.1% over the prior year. And same facility managed and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 7.7 -- 7.1%, a slight increase from our year-to-date trends.","Case mix increased 3.6% in the quarter. And same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $498 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Of this, same facility charity care discounts totaled $916 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $165 million from the prior year. While same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.139 billion, an increase of $333 million from the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter remained strong, consistent with our previous quarters in 2013. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.5%, reflecting increased acuity and surgical volume in our patient population.","As you see on a reported basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved to 44.9% from 45.8% in the fourth quarter of last year. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.5% on a same facility basis in the quarter.","Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.5% in the quarter when compared to last year. This primarily reflects the service intensity and increased surgical volume we saw in the quarter.","We recognized $50 million in electronic health record income in the fourth quarter compared to $80 million last year. The company also incurred approximately $28 million in EHR-related expenses in the quarter compared to $19 million in last year's fourth quarter and both of these are consistent with our expectations.","Cash flows from operating activities totaled $1.226 billion compared to $1.263 billion in last year's fourth quarter. We spent $596 million in capital expenditures in the quarter, bringing our full year CapEx spend to $1.943 billion. Days and AR increased slightly to 54 days at the end of the quarter.","At December 31, the company's ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.32x compared to 4.39x at September 30. And at the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $2 billion of availability under its revolving credit facilities.","That concludes my remarks in 2013. Now I'll turn it over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen","Good morning. I want to provide some detail on both fourth quarter volumes and market share performance for the company. Same facility inpatient admissions in the fourth quarter were down approximately 8,000. Three factors explain this decline. First, pulmonary admissions were down 9%, almost 3,500 admissions. We believe the lighter flu season is the reason. Second, Medicare short stay inpatient admissions, though staying less than 2 midnights, were down 12%, almost 2,500 admissions. And third, we believe the implementation of the CMS 2-Midnight Rule spilled over into other payors as short stay inpatient admissions and other payor categories declined by another 2,100 admissions, or 4%.","Outpatient observation visits, the alternative category for many short stay inpatient admissions, increased by almost 11,000, or 8.5%.","Pulmonary-related emergency room visits were down in the quarter by over 9%, or approximately 23,000 visits. This decline represents approximately 53% of the overall reduction in emergency room visits.","The positive story inside our volume analysis is the increased acuity. As you heard, our case mix index for the quarter was strong. This increase was driven by a number of factors. First, inpatient surgery volume grew by 1%. And as a result, surgical admissions were a larger percentage of total admissions in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year.","Secondly, across our surgical business, service lines with higher acuity, such as orthopedics, neurosciences and cardiovascular, grew at a faster rate.","And third, within our medical and surgical service lines, the overall acuity was higher within many individual service lines this quarter. We believe declines in short stay admissions explain some of this change.","Average length of stay increased by 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting the increased acuity of our inpatient visits.","Other inpatient statistics for the company are as follows: obstetric admissions grew by 1%, behavioral services admissions grew by 1.6%, rehabilitation admissions grew by 9%, and census levels inside our intensive care units were slightly up.","Same-facility outpatient surgical cases grew 1.6% in the quarter. We saw growth in both our hospital outpatient surgical departments and our ambulatory surgery division. We believe our program to become the O.R. of choice for our physicians and patients is driving this growth and our inpatient surgical growth.","In the quarter, 8 out of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgical volume and 10 out of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgical volumes. Our international division also had solid growth in total surgical volumes.","Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended June 2013. Once again, this data is the most current data available for the company and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets.","The company's inpatient market share for this period increased by 44 basis points to 23.8%. Inpatient demand in these markets during the 12-month period was essentially flat. For the 3 months ended June 2013, however, inpatient demand increased by 0.3%, which is a rebound from the decline in demand experienced in the first quarter of 2013.","We gained share in 13 out of 17 service lines. We gained share in 27 of 37 markets. Our market share in both the commercial and in migration segments of our business continue to grow in this period. Across all these metrics, the company's market share trends are generally consistent with past reports.","HCA continues to invest in its growth agenda. As you saw in our press release, we are going to increase capital spending in 2014 to around $2.2 billion, which is approximately $200 million greater than 2013. This increase will go to expanding our operating capacity in existing facilities and to expanding the number of facilities, both inpatient and outpatient, in our existing markets.","As part of our capital spending for 2013 and 2014, the company will add approximately 770 new inpatient beds and 270 emergency room beds. Included in these additions are 5 new hospitals, 2 of which have already begun operations; 15 new emergency rooms in outreach markets; and 3 replacement surgery centers.","Additionally, we are investing in more technology and organizational resources to improve our quality and service offering, which should make our facilities more competitive and responsive to the needs of our patients and physicians.","And with that, let me turn the call back to Bill.","William B. Rutherford","Thank you, Sam. So now let me conclude with the discussion about health reform and some additional commentary on 2014 guidance.","As Milton mentioned and I think we all know, much uncertainty remains around health reform. So we want to walk you through the approach we used in developing our guidance range. We remain optimistic on the long-term benefits of health reform. But given the slower-than-expected rollout, discussion around the percentage of enrollment that are newly insured, the reported disruption in the individual and small group marketplace and lack of specific market level enrollment data, our outlook and evaluation of health reform will remain fluid during the year. As mentioned in our release, we are currently estimating a positive impact of health reform on our adjusted EBITDA between 1% and 2%.","While there are multiple assumptions around health reform, there are really 4 key variables that drive the majority of our estimated impact. First, are the assumptions around the final enrollment and exchanges and newly covered Medicaid lives due to expansion. We operate in 4 states that elected to expand Medicaid as of this time: California, Nevada, Colorado and Kentucky. So Medicaid expansion has only a moderate impact within our estimate versus the exchange enrollment.","On the exchange enrollment, your information is as current as ours. Knowing that there are roughly 2 million people enrolled in exchanges at the end of 2013 and that was updated last week to now just under 3 million enrolled. And our model builds from this base.","The second variable to the model is the estimate for the percentage of enrollment that was previously uninsured versus previously insured. I believe we've all read a variety of ranges on this issue over the past couple of weeks and our model makes some broad estimates for this variable.","The third variable is our participation in exchange networks, the related revenue clearance of this exchange network volume and assumptions around metal tier selection. Currently, 97% of our facilities participate in exchange product. 64% of our facilities have access to the lowest-priced bronze and 54% have an access to the lowest-priced silver.","The last variable relates to assumptions around out-of-network treatment and reimbursement.","Over the past several months, our team, with the assistance of outside resources, have performed exhaustive market evaluation, data analysis and updated our market-by-market assumptions on each of these and other variables. It is the product of this work and our updated assumptions that have led to the guidance we're sharing with you today.","In summary, our estimate is the net effect of the upside remodel for our share of newly insured individuals, offset by lower revenue clearance for the migration of previously insured moving into an exchange or exchange-like product. The summation of our work can be characterized that we're estimating 7% to 9% of our uninsured business will gain some new coverage. And this will provide a positive benefit in new reimbursement. However, this will be partially offset with some revenue clearance decline from previously insured exchange enrollment. The net effect being an increase in our adjusted EBITDA between 1% and 2%.","So to conclude my health reform comments, we know all of this is still unfolding and there remain many unknowns. Clearly, it is important to share with you some insight into how we're thinking about reform.","All right. So let's move on to 2014 guidance. As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2014 consolidated revenues should range from $35.5 billion to $36.5 billion. This does not include the impact from any acquisitions not yet completed.","We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $6.6 billion and $6.85 billion. Within our revenue estimate, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range from 1% to 2% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for 2014.","Medicare revenues in 2014 reflect the composite growth rate of approximately 1%, factoring the market basket changes, OCA [ph] reduction and the annualizing effect to sequestration.","Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission is estimated to be flat year-over-year. And for 2014, we have virtually all of our managed care revenue under contract, with rates averaging between 4.5% and 5.5%.","Operating expenses are anticipated to continue to benefit from a continued low inflationary environment in 2014. And our operating expense guidance is built on maintaining margins, while we continued to invest into our clinical and EHR development initiatives.","HITECH revenues for 2014 are estimated to range from $110 million to $130 million, a reduction of approximately $100 million from 2013. HITECH expenses should also range from $110 million to $130 million for the year, comparable to last year.","2014 guidance also incorporates the third year of our post-IPO share-based awards and noncash share-based compensation expense, which is expected to increase to approximately $168 million for the year, or an increase of $55 million from 2013. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion.","Interest expense is projected to be about $1.8 billion as well. And our effective tax rates will be approximately 38.5%. We're estimating our outstanding share count would average just over 461 million shares. And lastly, our earnings per diluted share guidance for 2014 is $3.45 to $3.75.","So with that, I conclude my remarks, turn it over to Vic for some Q&A.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Bill, thank you. Sam and Milton, as well. All right. Casey, you want to come back on? We're going to poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] All yours, Casey.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Obviously, reform is a huge task to model into the business. But I was wondering if you could help us further -- the explanation was great, Bill -- I was wondering if you can help us further. There's still some lingering focus on the provisions for doubtful accounts and either using that as a proxy for how much reform might add, or I think more materially, trying to understand how it's going to change with at least some of your uninsured volumes being covered. Could you walk through your thoughts on that, please, with us? And also any timing that you might be able to help us out with in terms of understanding when you think you might have enough data to update us again on reform?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Who wants that? Bill?","William B. Rutherford","I'll take the first stab and then Milton or Sam add in as necessary. Sheryl, thank you for the question. So we believe by laying out our expectation of 7% to 9% of uninsured gaining some coverage give some insight in how we're thinking about that. We know that will leave 92%, 94% of our current uninsured business that will still flow through on to bad debt. And we know that book has been growing 6% to 8% a year. So maybe hard to see the impact to that on our provision at least on our reported statements. As part of our deduct that we say partially offsets the upside of the uninsured is the conversion of insured into an exchange product. A subset of that population will move into a product that is comparable revenue clearance. There's a subset of that population that will move into exchange product, with perhaps some reduced revenue clearance, either through a discount for participating on exchange product or higher bad debt because of deductible and coinsurance. So that offsets some of that movement on the previously uninsured. And some of that may move into a restricted network. And we'll either see that in an out-of-network position or it be directed around us. So I think it's hard for us to kind of see that exactly show up on our provision of uninsured. There will be some relief with the uninsured gaining coverage. But we'll see some continued growth with the business that remains. And there'll be some offset to that with increased bad debts with the higher deductible and co-pays for exchange-like products. That's my best answer...","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, do you want to add?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. Allow me to maybe help frame a little bit. If you think about this year, 2013, when you look at our self-pay or uninsured revenue, increased by roughly $100 million over '12. When you look at our provision for doubtful accounts, roughly about 70% of that amount in 2013 was used to reserve for self-pay revenue or uninsured revenue, leaving about 30% for co-pay and deductibles for insured patients. So that kind of maybe helps frame how it's growing most recently coming into reform. When I think about reform as well into 2014, I think it's going to be, the benefits will probably be more back-end loaded. There would be probably some small benefit we'll see in the first quarter, growing maybe into the second. But really, we see it as more a third and fourth quarter opportunity for us, quite frankly. So as you think about modeling that 1% to 2%, I see it more of a back-end loaded number for us rather than early here in 2014. And as far as when we think we'll have more clarity about some of these variables, at the very earliest, and this again is the earliest that I would expect and I'm not sure we'll have it then, is midyear. So when we give our -- into the -- in the third quarter of '14, where we're giving second quarter earnings analysis, we might have some more clarity around some of these variables as we see the first 6 months of reform. But again, because I think it's going to be largely back-end loaded, it may be even later into the year. But I'd say, midyear would be the earliest. I don't think we'll have much color based on the first quarter results, frankly.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate your description on the pending acquisitions not being included in the guidance, but I was hoping you could give us a little color surrounding those pending deals, when you think those might close and how much those might contribute? And then also, just the development activity in the CapEx that you've outlined, how much of that is implied in the guidance that actually comes online in 2014?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, Frank. As far as acquisition impact, based on the pipeline today, I don't think it would be material impact in 2014. You may have read yesterday, or may have been released late last week, that our hospital transaction with Ascension in Kansas City for a 2-hospital transaction, is not going to happen, could not get the FTC clearance. So that deal is off. Of course, we are integrating our 3 hospitals in the Tampa market that we acquired from IASIS in 2013. I don't expect those -- those are built in to our guidance since we did have those -- acquired those by the end of the year. Those are built in. So right now, I don't expect -- hopefully, something will come up here in 2014 that will be attractive for us. But nothing in the pipeline that I think will be material as of today.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And on the development?","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes. And Frank, this is Sam. Let me add to the answer Milton just gave you around the capital. A couple of things. One, for any large capital expenditures that we do inside of HCA, we have a very specific process that we hold to, to ensure that the expectations around those capital projects are included in our budgets and plans as laid out in those approvals. So there's a natural flow of those expectations in our guidance. The second thing is, on new capital, there is a natural ramp-up. These are long-lived assets and we have a natural ramp-up that occurs on new capital that goes into the market. And some of that is fed into the guidance for 2014, but it's not that material as it relates to the overall performance of the company.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify 2 things, I think it was Bill that was talking. The first is, when you went through some of the detailed metrics behind the 2014 guidance, did you give same-store admissions or just admissions outlook? Did I miss that?","William B. Rutherford","Yes, Gary. So we said, admissions -- equivalent admissions would range 1% to 2% and revenue per equivalent admissions would run 2% to 3%.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Sorry I missed that. And then, just my second clarification. When you said for 2014 you expect 7% to 9% of uninsured to gain coverage, you're saying 7% to 9% of your uninsured adjusted admissions volume, right, not 7% to 9% of the uninsured population in your market. I'm just trying to...","William B. Rutherford","Correct. That would be 7 -- as we step down enrollment, enrollment in our markets, our share kind of equates to 7% to 9% of our current uninsured volume.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Are you assuming a pro rata, so 9% get covered, that's a 9% impact -- I'm just trying to understand if you've baked in this concept of some of those folks are disproportionate utilizers or you just kind of pro rata the enrollment to your uninsured volume.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. Gary, this is Milton. I mean, so the stat that Bill gave you is just the coverage statistic and we have other assumptions in the model around utilization from the population that gains coverage. So that's an independent variable from the overall coverage variable.","Operator","We'll go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sam, I just wanted to go back to the comment around outpatient observation. I think you said in your prepared remarks that they were up 8%, maybe 11,000 cases in the quarter. Was that all traditional Medicare? Was it across other payors? Just any color would be helpful.","Samuel N. Hazen","I don't have the exact payor mix of all of our observation visits in front of me. I'll say that the short stay admission decline was fairly broad-based across all of our payors. So I would infer from that, that as a result of our increase in observation visits, we saw natural growth in all the different payor classes for observations. I've got it in my office, I just didn't bring it in here with me. And I can get that information to Mark and he can get it back to you. But I think it's reasonable to assume that.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one other one. Just, Bill, can you remind us on the restricted basket and where you are now?","William B. Rutherford","Yes. We're -- about $750 million we anticipate by the end of the year.","Operator","We'll go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I want to ask about your surgery trends. When we look at the ratio of your inpatient surgeries to that of your inpatient admissions, it's really moved up. And I recall it being much higher. Before the downturn, probably 32% to 33%, we're now back up to 29%, 30%. So I guess, I'm just wondering if you can comment a little bit more about what you guys are seeing, whether this is some kind of comeback? Have you based out in CRM and some of the other things that cause the pressure on surgery and just broader thoughts on how surgeries play into your outlook for 2014?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Sam, do you want that one?","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes. When I think about surgery as a percent of our total business, I think there's 2 components that affect it as you look at that ratio. First, I mean, we are intentionally investing heavily in our surgical growth across the company. We've been doing that now for over 2 years and I think it's having an impact. It's all embedded in what we call our O.R. of choice initiative where we are intentionally detailing each of our surgical departments to ensure that they have the necessary equipment to meet our physician needs and patient needs, that they have the right process, improvement efforts in place to ensure efficiency. And then, we are very specific with our physician liaisons to respond to the individual physician's needs as it relates to scheduling and so forth. And I think, in addition to the capital that we've committed to that, those elements are driving improved performance for the company. And we continue to believe that there is capacity in that effort and opportunities for continued improvement in growth along the lines of what we've seen over the last couple of years. The second thing that affects the ratio that you're referring to is the fact that our emergency room volume has slowed a little bit and we haven't seen the emergency room admissions that we had seen in previous years. And a lot of the emergency room admission activity is medicine-oriented business. And when you put that into the mix, it affects that ratio that you were referring to as well. But when you look inside our market share and look specifically inside a surgical service line, we're seeing solid growth in orthopedics. We're seeing solid growth in neurosciences. We're gaining ground in general surgery categories. And so, I feel very good about that metric bumping up against the effort that I just mentioned to you. And again, I think 2014 is a year where we're still pretty optimistic around what we're doing on the surgical front.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the guidance, I'm trying to back into what you're implying for kind of core EBITDA growth. And I think we've talked previously and you mentioned 3% to 5% as kind of your core target. I'm getting closer to 2% to 4% within that guidance after making the adjustments for the stock comp and the health care IP. Just wondering if I'm missing anything, or if there's some reason for maybe some increased conservatism?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, you want that one?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Justin, if you walk down the low end and the high end of our guidance, adjusting for the 3 items that we've identified, HITECH revenue, if you back out $120 million out of both sides of our guidance there for 2014, you back out the share -- or add back the share-based comp expense of $168 million to each side. And then, if you use the 1% to 2% of EBITDA, you'll get a range of $65 million to $130 million for health care reform. And so, if you adjust the high and the low for that, what I get -- we do that math and compare it to the adjusted number for '13, is at the low end we've got a growth rate implied of 1.75%; and on the high end, a growth rate implied, about 4.6%. So our -- that would be -- and that would be our core range there. So this year, we've guided ranging from our guidance from 1.75% to 4.6%. Clearly, when you think about the point estimate in that range, it would be in the 3% to 5% zone.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just ask, what are you assuming for the percentage of people that are newly covered within that guidance assumption? You mentioned that as one of the core -- percentage of enrollment previously uninsured, is one of the 4 key issues. Just to make sure what you're assuming there.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, Justin. We're not going to disclose the detailed assumptions. What we wanted to do this morning was to give you, obviously, the projected impact on 2014 EBITDA. Bill walked through the 4 main variables of reform, one of which being the percentage in the exchange enrollment that's newly insured. But we're not going to disclose that level of our model. And we want some experience to see how it plays out over time, of course. But we're not going to disclose the detailed assumptions of those key variables at this point in time.","Victor L. Campbell","And obviously, as we build our model, we put ranges in for that and other items to get some comfort with it. But we start dwelling on single points and it lead you to the next one and the next one. So as the year goes, we'll provide a little more color on that. Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to go back to the offset of the previously insured, getting coverage and moving to the exchanges. Is there an assumption that you'll just flat-out loose volume versus the added network, I would assume if you capture, would actually be sort of incrementally beneficial to you. So I guess, one is, what that assumption is, just straight-up loss volume. Or does it largely just reflect lower pricing on the exchange and collection? And maybe just remind us of your pricing on the exchange relative to your commercial book.","William B. Rutherford","Ralph, Bill. So I'll walk you through and kind of do it before answering [indiscernible]. There's kind of 4 subsets of those previously uninsured. I think as Milton said, we're going to resist giving you our exact assumptions under each one of those, knowing that it's fluid and there's offsets and there's different points. But we know there's a subset of that population that is moving into a comparable product with really comparable revenues, so set that aside. There's a subset of that population that's moving into an exchange product. And there's a discount associated with that relative to participation. And there's likely some higher bad debts associated with that, salary deductibles and co-pays. There's a subset of that population to your question that moves into a restricted network. And a portion of those we may see in and out of network basis, given our footprint in the marketplace. And yes, there's an assumption for a portion of those that we lose because they get directed away from our network. But again, I think we're going to resist giving you the exact assumptions as we break that out, knowing that it becomes fluid. And it's part and parcel of a multiple other assumptions we're using in our estimate.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. I think, too, one thing to think about here as health care reform is being implemented across the nation and, of course, we all read about and saw the disruption in the individual market. And so we have factored that in, into our guidance. The question I would have is, is that disruption a onetime event? So it may be an event that may have more impact here in 2014 than in later years. But again, you have to see that play out.","Operator","We'll go to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question also on the impact of reform. I think you said that the 1% to 2% positive is obviously exclusive of the Medicare cuts that you've seen now for a couple of years. So is it safe to assume net, net the ACA is still a negative for you guys in '14? And then, I'm also curious, the 1% to 2%, how does that vary by state? I know you've got 4 states you're spending Medicaid. So I'm just curious, is it a much bigger positive impact in those states and, obviously -- or and is it actually not positive in the other states?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Josh, this is Vic. If you go back and look at -- and these are percentage points cuts to market basket of productivity, we started seeing hits in 2011. There was a 0.25 reduction. Then in '12, it was 1.1. In '13, it was 80 basis points. In '14, it's another 80 basis points. So you can kind of run those numbers through and you can see that they're bigger than the upside range we just gave you for '14. So obviously, we've been incurring these cuts to get there. And so, it'll take a little while for that to offset it. The second piece of it, I think, we're not going to go into state-by-state. So obviously, there's still not a lot of data. We've obviously made assumptions. There are not many of our states with Medicaid expansion, but we do get some benefits a little bit in California and Colorado. We're really small in Kentucky. And in Nevada, we would pick up some as well through Medicaid. We're also continuing to be hopeful that we'll see some states step up and expand their Medicaid in out years. But at this point, we're going to kind of hold back in terms of any specific state information.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess not necessarily quantifying the states, but I'm thinking about what if Florida does go, et cetera, this year, just what's the incremental delta in your average state that has expanded Medicaid versus the average delta...","Victor L. Campbell","Yes. We're not going to that detail at this point. We'll see as we get later in the year. If we learn and have some real-time data that's worth sharing, we'll go there. But right now, those are the assumptions we're willing to put out on the table.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about what your experience has been like with the use of Certified Application Counselors in hospitals? Has that gone smoothly? Has it improved as the technology on the exchanges has gotten better? And then also, if you can maybe talk about any benefit from presumptive eligibility that you're seeing?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Bill, do you want those...","William B. Rutherford","Yes. Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for the question. So we have about 400 Certified Application Counselors throughout our system that continue to screen and counsel patients in our facilities. We definitely have seen that activity ramp up compared to October and November when there were issues with the website. And that continues to be an active part of our reform effort. We continue to evaluate some other outreach efforts for -- within our marketplace for uninsured as well. But the Certified Application Counselor activity continues to counsel a lot of people. And we have seen the assistance in the application increase here in December and January and hoped to see that continue to grow in February and March. It did have a slow start, just given the website piece of that. On presumptive eligibility, we're still working with our states on there. You know some of our states already have presumptive eligibility. There is a certification process and application process that you go through. We think that, ultimately, will just allow us to accelerate some Medicaid applications versus necessarily increase our net-net yield. And so, we're still optimistic on the presumptive eligibility piece.","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Gallucci with FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","First, I just wanted to clarify. Did you have -- outline the margin expectation for EBITDA for 2014? And then, from a bigger picture standpoint, we're sort of seeing the impact of the exchanges and deductibles rising there in the private sector traditionally. How are you sort of thinking about the seasonality of the business these days? Is it materially different as you think to the future compared to the past?","R. Milton Johnson","With respect to margin, I think in the comments, we said margin maintenance, so we're trying to manage our cost to match our revenue and would be margin maintenance would be the target for 2014. Sam, do you want to respond to the seasonality?","Samuel N. Hazen","I think if you look back over the past few years, we started to see more outpatient demand occur in the last half of the year, especially in surgical areas and some other outpatient service lines. That has been a shift. We've heard it from our physicians and we've seen it in our data and so forth. And I think it's natural to assume that, that's coming from hard deductibles and co-pay requirements that get exhausted as the year progresses and people decide to go ahead and get their procedures done in the latter part of the year. So on the outpatient side, I do see more seasonality toward the end of the year than what we've seen in the past. And actually, in this fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, on a sequential basis, our outpatient surgical activity, I think, grew somewhere around 6.5% to 7%. Last year, it grew about 6%. So it really wasn't changed materially from the previous year as far as the sequential performance on that particular metric. Obviously, the first quarter has variation from 1 year to the next as it relates to flu season activity, I think, primarily. But that would be the only thing that drives uniqueness from 1 year to the next. But clearly, on the outpatient side, we have seen a seasonality shift that is more in the back half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Joanna Gajuk, filling in for Kevin today. I would just -- I'd like to ask a little bit more about the reform assumptions there and also what you are doing around that. First, as a follow-up to the comment you made about what you include in terms of utilization assumption for the people getting insurance, we are thinking that it's probably sicker people that are buying insurance. So if you can comment how you feel about that. And also around the outreach for '14, your markets around reform and if you can maybe shed some light in terms of are you having more success signing up people for Medicaid for those in the Medicaid expansion stage and how that compared to your success rates in signing up people for core Medicaid, so to speak?","Victor L. Campbell","Bill, you want to...","William B. Rutherford","Yes. So on utilization, I think as Milton mentioned before, we do have a utilization factor built into our model for the newly insured. That's just one of many variables that's in our model, so I'm hesitant to really kind of talk about what that actual utilization factor is. I think we've all read reports about some increased activity. And so we do have a utilization factor in on that piece as we look at that 7% to 9%. But it's one of many variables that's included in our model. Regarding the outreach, principally, our efforts have been around our CACs, our Certified Application Counselors, as people visit our facilities. We have an effort underway in several -- in a couple of markets to do outreach for uninsured patients that have visited our facilities over the past 12 to 18 months. And that includes both outbound calls and other outreach efforts. So I think it's too early to kind of report on the net effect of that. You also may know that we have fairly robust Medicaid eligibility processes already in place at our facilities. So if an individual shows up, we assist them with evaluating coverage options. And if they turn out to be eligible for Medicaid within our states already, we go through a Medicaid eligibility process to assist them to gain coverage. So all of that is part of not only our ongoing operations effort, but some increased activity relative to reform adoption.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm going to have a 2-part here. First of all, you didn't really provide much update on Parallon. Is there anything to say there? And then second, on the exchange area itself, thanks for the comments about where you're at with respect to the bronze and silver. When you think about your market share in the markets where you're at and how you're positioned on the exchanges, do you think you're sort of in a position to maintain your current share? I know there were some discussions about out-of-network strategies and so forth. Give us some flavor for a little bit more how you're positioned with the payors on the exchanges if possible?","Victor L. Campbell","All right...","R. Milton Johnson","Let me make couple of comments on Parallon. Bill, I'll ask you to maybe comment, as well, before we go to the exchange positioning. First of all, I think that Parallon, actually, is moving very well, going very well. We think about 2014, we've got The Outsource Group, our acquisition to complete the integration into Parallon and we see some upside there of course with that. With respect to LifePoint implementation, it continues to move on schedule and we should be fully implemented with LifePoint in 2014. And then of course, we are starting to build out of our service center for CHP in Cincinnati and that is on schedule and underway. And looking forward to starting that transition into the consolidated environment for CHP. So things at Parallon are moving very well and on track with our expectations.","William B. Rutherford","Yes. We're still bullish on Parallon. We're seeing our opportunities in our pipeline continue to be out there and the team is really performing well.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Do you want to talk about the metal position on the exchange?","R. Milton Johnson","I think, again, we've -- we've added, I think, again, the number of hospitals we have in each level at the lowest or second lowest tier. But Juan, any other comments you have about or knowledge you have about...","Juan Vallarino","Sure. AJ, it's still evolving. It's a relatively small part of the business. [indiscernible] There are some markets, very few, where we're not positioned correctly. There are lot more markets, the major markets where we are very well positioned. And until we get enrollment data, I think, it's too early to tell how poorly positioned or how well positioned we really are.","Victor L. Campbell","And Milton?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. Let me just add with respect to reform. Obviously, over the coming year, we're going to continue to monitor the actual exchange volume, understand utilization, the bad debt, the capture of the other network share. And also with respect to Parallon, monitoring our revenue cycle capabilities to make sure that we can be effective in collecting the patient portions of any out-of-pocket that is due from this newly insured group. And again, we'll continue to look at opportunities to be in more networks in the exchange as we go through 2014. And then, as we see how our strategy is playing out, we'll be evaluating our strategy market-by-market and could make changes if we feel like that we would be better positioned in the network. So there's a number of moving parts with respect to our reform strategy as we enter in 2014. And I'm sure those strategies will be considered and be constantly reviewed, as well, throughout the year.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Thank you, team.

Just a reminder that today's call is being recorded and for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor Campbell","All right, Laurie. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call including those of you on the webcast. Here this morning as usual, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, CFO and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause annual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and included in our various SEC filings.

A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the fourth quarter earnings release.","This morning\u2019s call is being recorded as you know and a replay is available later today.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning each of you joining us on the call and the webcast this morning. Now this morning we issued our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release. The release is consistent with the preview we issued on the 9th of January. I\u2019ll make a few comments on the quarter and the year and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter and 2017 guidance.","We finished the year on a solid note with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totalling $2.206 [ph] billion a record quarter for adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our industry as adjusted EBITDA by 3.6%. For the year, we reported adjusted EBITDA about $8.216 billion up 3.8% over 2015.","For the full year 2016 diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses of sale facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and legal claim calls, benefit cost increased 23.6% over full year 2015.","2016 was the year in which we performed well and light of just for comparisons to prior year growth performance. We executed our growth agenda effectively in 2016 as we continued our focus on adding access points to our network, broadening service line capabilities and expanding debt in clinical service offerings.","Our growth agenda has delivered consistent performance. In fact, to illustrate the company has reported same facility admission and adjusted admissions growth for nine consecutive years, ER visit growth for 10 consecutive years and surgical growth for three consecutive years.","We believe our strategies will continue to be effective and position us well for the future. WE believe investing capital in our existing markets is the key component of our growth strategy. In 2016, we invested $2.76 billion in capital expenditures for expansion of services and capacity in our large fast growing urban markets.","And as you may have noted in our guidance issued this morning we expect to invest approximately $2.9 billion in 2017.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $5.65 billion of cash flow from operating activities in 2016, up 19.4% over 2015. In 2016, as Bruce will mention we invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, we distributed $434 million to non-controlling parties producing free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion.","We returned $2.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases which resulted in HCA repurchasing about 36.3 million shares of our stock or approximately 9% of our outstanding shares since the beginning of 2016.","On this subject of capital allocation, the company has not paid a regular dividend since its IPO here in 2011. And we have decided to maintain our current policy on dividend payouts.","Although we remained confident in our long term growth prospects, we believe its\u2019 prudent to take conservative approach and maintain maximum financial flexibility until we gain greater clarity of health and tax policies at the federal levels.","Today, we believe share repurchase is the appropriate means to return free cash flow to shareholders, but we will continue to evaluate our policy overtime. I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on our recent settlement with the Healthcare foundation of Kansas City.","The Missouri Court of Appeals recently reversed key parts of an earlier court's decision and confirmed that we spent in excess of $450 million during the five year term following our acquisition of the health Midwest Health system in 2030.","While we disagree with the remainder of the Court ruling, we felt it was best to end this long standing dispute and we have entered into a final resolution agreement with the healthcare foundation of Kansas City.","In the 14 year since our acquisition at Kansas City, we have invested over $1 billion in the market to expand and upgrade our facilities and add new services, and I\u2019m very proud of the work we have done in Kansas City. I\u2019m proud of the settlements and based on earlier court\u2019s decision, the company had reported liability of $478 million. This settlement of $188 million brings a final resolution to this dispute and allows us to continue our focus on caring for the Kansas City community.","I\u2019ll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2017 guidance included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yield was approximately 2.5% to 6% growth for 2017. Our guidance reflects continued volume growth, reasonable pricing and well managed expense growth. I am looking forward to 2017 and I believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for the year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2017 guidance and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sam for some comments on our operations.","As Milton commented we are pleased with the quarter\u2019s results. Fourth quarter was a difficult comp for us with a strong result we had in Q4 of 2015. However, our extensive management helped to deliver another good quarter and solid performance for the year.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 3.6% to $2.206 billion to $2.131 billion last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 20.7% versus 20.8% last year. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.5%.","During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare Admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.7% and 3% respectively. This equates both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 5.3% on a same facility basis and represents 33.6% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.1% and 3% respectively in the quarter, consistent with recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter, representing 7.6% of our total admissions, compared with a 7.7% last year.","Managed care another which included exchange admissions declined 0.4% and equivalent admissions were essentially flat on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented19.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter slightly lower than the prior year.","Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 3.3% compared to the prior year period. Same facility in patient surgeries increased 1.4% and outpatient surgeries declined 0.6% from the prior years.","Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increase 1.9% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.5% in the quarter which is treated consistent with our recent trends.","Same facility managed care and other case mix increased 3.4% compared to last year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $660 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.047 billion in the quarter, an increase of $82 million from the prior year period while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.469 billion, an increase of $578 million over the prior year.","Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were down slightly to 44.8% compared to the 44.9% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 5.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, this increase was primarily driven by growth in medical device expanded increased volume and some higher acuity services such as [Indiscernible] procedures, neurological cases and orthopaedics. Other operating expenses include 30 basis points in the last year\u2019s fourth quarter a 17.7% of revenue mix.","Let me touch briefly on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we saw approximately 12,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared to 11,300 in the fourth quarter of last year. For full year of 2016 our health exchange admissions increased approximately 15% over 2015 levels and represented about 2.7% of total admissions.","We saw about 43,900 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 38,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.For full year 2016 health exchange ER visits increased 23% and represented 2.4% of total ER visits.","All-in-all health reform activity was generally in line with our expectations. As reported earnings per share for full year 2016 was $7.30 as compared to $4.99 in the prior year. 2016 earnings per share includes positive benefits of $0.39 to the Kansas City legal settlement, $0.41 to the effect of the adoption of new accounting standard related to the tax benefits for equity awards and $0.13 to the completion of federal tax audits for 2011 and 2012.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. The strength of our cash flow and the disappointment of balanced approach to capital allocation remains an important advantage for the company. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.699 billion compared to $1.558 billion last year.","For the full year 2016 cash flow from operations was $5.65 billion up over $900 million from the $4.73 billion last year. As we mentioned throughout the year cash flow from operations includes approximately $160 million for the full year of 2016 from our adoption of the accounting standard on reporting the tax benefits related to equity awards.","After adjusting for this accounting change, cash from operations increased approximately $740 million or just over 15%. In addition, cash flow from operations included an improvement in net AR day\u2019s decrease of 53 last year to 50 at December 31st 2016.","Capital spending for the year increased to $2.76 billion from $2.375 billion in 2015 as we continue to invest in long term growth opportunities for the company. Free cash flow for 2016 was $2.459 billion a $595 million increase or 32% over $1.864 billion in 2015 and as a note of mention we completed $2.75 billion of share repurchases during the year.","We had approximately $1.85 billion remaining on our $2 billion authorisation as of December 31, 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.1 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.8 times.","Also it is important to highlight this activity through our capital market transactions. Over the past couple of years we\u2019ve reduced our weighted average interest cost to approximately 5.3% at December 31. Our return on invested capital was approximately 16.6% as of the end of the year. These cash flow and balance sheet metrics highlight an important key string for the company and allows us to continue to invest for long term growth, distributing value to our share repurchase program, maintain ample liquidity and maintain our leverage ratio towards a lower end of our stated range, all of this positions us very well going into 2017.","So with that, I\u2019ll move into a discussion about our 2017 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2017 consolidated revenues should range from $43 billion to $44 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.4 billion and $8.7 billion.","Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year, and the revenue for equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for 2017. We anticipate our Medicare revenues for equivalent admissions to reflect a composite growth rate were approximately 1% to 2%, factoring a market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues for accrual mission are estimated flat year-over-year and manage and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%.","We also anticipate grow and share based compensation of approximately $40 million and the anticipate operating expenses per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.","Relative to health reform, we do expect some modest growth in health exchange volumes, but isolating the net EBITDA impact to health reform from core operations that are becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult.","We will continue to report on exchange volume which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has a lot of increase in this fourth year of reform. As an overall summary, we believe reform contribution in 2017 will be materially equivalent to what the contribution we experienced was in 2016.","Relative to other aspects of our guidance we anticipate capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2017 as we see continued opportunities to invest in our markets and support a key strategic initiative.","We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.05 billion and interest expense to be approximately 1.7 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 34%.","And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 376.5 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted guidance for 2017 is between $7.20 to $7.60.","Earnings per diluted share guidance includes an estimated 150 million income tax benefit, or $0.40 per diluted share, related to the accounting standard on recording excess tax benefits related to equity award, but does that not include losses or gains on sale facilities, losses on retirement of debt, a legal claim costs.","So, that concludes my remarks and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sam for some additional.","Samuel Hazen","Good morning. Let me began by giving you some of the volume stats that are normally provide on these calls. Once again in both the quarter and the year the company had broad-based volume growth across our market and across most of the facilities in service lines that make up our business.","For domestic operations on a same facility basis, eleven of 14 divisions had growth in admissions in both the quarter and in the year. Non-division had growth in adjusted admissions in the quarter and 13 divisions had growth in the year.","10 divisions had emergency room visits growth in the quarter. Free standing emergency room visits grew 11% and accounted for approximately 60% of our overall ER growth in the quarter.","Hospital based emergency room visits grew 0.7% in the quarter. In the year 13 divisions had emergency room visits growth. Inpatients surgeries grew 1.7% in the quarter, surgical admissions were 28.1% of total admissions in the quarter.","Inpatient surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular orthopaedics and neurosurgery categories. For the year surgical admissions were 28.3% of total which is an increase over the prior year.","10 divisions had inpatient surgeries growth in the year. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter about 0.6%, hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes decline 0.5% and volumes decline 0.7% in our free standing ambulatory surgery division.","Seven of our divisions in a quarter had growth in outpatient surgery volume. In the divisions that were down multiple service lines accounted for the decline. For the year, outpatient surgeries grew 1.2% with a 11 divisions showing growth.","Behavioral health admissions grew 0.8% in the quarter and 2.2% in the year. Rehab admissions grew 5% in the quarter and 3.3% in the year. Deliveries were down 1.8% in the quarter and down 1% in the year. Again most of these declines were in Medicaid payers.","Neonatal admissions increased 0.5% in the both the quarter and the year. Cardiology procedures grew 4.7% which is generally consistent with the growth rate for the year.","Trauma volumes grew 18% in both the quarter and the year, observations visits were up 2.7% in the quarter and it grew 7% in the year. All-in-all the fourth quarter in 2016 were solid periods of growth for the company and they continue to show as Milton said a consistent pattern of growth over many years.","We believe our strong portfolio of markets and favorable trends within them should yield overall demand growth in the range of 2% to 2.5% per year over the next few years.","Our approach to these markets remains the same as we strive to be the provider system of choice for patients and physicians, the improvements we have made in clinical and operational metrics coupled with our increasing capital spending position the company well from a competitive position and should provides the solid growth prospect in the future.","The company has over $4.5 billion of capital in-flight that is just to hit our markets. This in-flight capital which is approved project that are not yet in service and should be completed over the next three years will add urgent care centers and free standing emergency links to our provider systems allowing us to improve patient access and experience with more conveniently located facilities.","Additionally, it will increase capacity in existing hospitals by adding more inpatient beds, emergency room beds and operating suites thus relieving constraints in many situations.","And lastly, it will enhance service line offerings with new equipment in clinical technology which will provide a better environment for nurses and physicians in delivering care to our patients.","In addition to capital spending our growth agenda includes coordinated marketing strategy, patient care coordination systems and multiple human resource programs that are particularly focused on physician developments and nursing operations.","This agenda is supported by strong execution systems and resource by the unique scale and operational capabilities of HCA. In sum, we believe we continue to have solid growth opportunities across our diversified portfolio of market and services lines and we believe our local provider systems are well-positioned to capitalized on these opportunities in the future.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, Simone, Samuel and Milton. Lori, if you come back on and poll for questions, and as we always do I\u2019m encourage each of you that limit yourself for one question and if you got a second jump back in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Whit Mayo of Robert W. Baird.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Maybe just to start with that last point, Sam, if you could perhaps elaborate a bit more on some of the certain, the capital priorities for 2017 or maybe just broadly the $4.5 billion of in-flight capital that you referenced. Is there anything that's for unique or different this year versus the prior-year or third any specific larger project that we should be aware of and then maybe if you could just comment quickly on just the cash flow expectations for 2017? Thanks.","A \u2013 William Rutherford -","With respect to the capital spending plan for the company with, for the most part, there aren't any significant changes in our approach to capital spending. We believe the company has growth prospects in many of our markets. We've been investing to take advantage of those growth prospects by expanding like I said our networks where we're adding facilities and so forth. And then at the same time, we have a number of facilities that are operating at unusually high occupancy levels, forcing us to address certain capacity constraints.","When you look at our capital spending, that we report in our cash flow statement, some of that capital is being spent but it takes a while for these projects to come online and that's why wanted to give you a sense of what's in the pipeline for the company because we have been accelerating our capital spending. And as this capital starts to come unwind more in 2017 and 2018, then it is coming online in 2016 and 2015 we're expected to at roughly 1% to 1.5% to our bed capacity on the inpatient side, roughly 4% to 4.5% on our emergency room side.","And we think those are important component of our overall growth strategy. We spent about $250 million a year on our key capital. We spent about $1.5 billion on routine related capital and in the balance tends to be more strategic addressing these growth prospects and addressing some of these capacity constraints. No bolus is unusually going to one market or the other, so it\u2019s diversified from the standpoint of market. It's further diversified from the standpoint of facilities within those markets and then from a service line standpoint, I would submit that it's quite diversified as well, and we think this is a very conservative deployment approach. It's very effective in resourcing our growth agenda is across the company. And we're optimistic that it's going to yields value for the company over time.","And then at the same time we have a number of facilities that are operating at unusually high occupancy levels forcing us to address certain capacity constraints.

Milton Johnson","Yeah. We\u2019re on cash flow. We anticipating cash flow from operations to range somewhere between 5.3 and 5.5 billion, will be down slightly from this year due to the some anticipated increase in cash taxes.","Whit Mayo","Got you.","Victor Campbell -","What Sam said about increase just to frame it, I'm looking here, it's a two-year period in 2012 and 2013. We added about 800 inpatient beds during that two-year window and 2014, 2015 to your window we added about 900 new beds inpatient beds and for 2016, 2017 two-year period, there be almost 1000. So as Sam was saying is increasing the amount capital coming on my way expect that to grow, we\u2019ll make about 2017, 2018 as well.","Whit Mayo","All right. Thank you, Vic.","Operator","And moving next to A. J. Rice at UBS.","A. J. Rice","Thanks, hi, everybody. I'm going to try to squeeze in two here real quick, if I could. One, obviously there's been a lot of focus on the repeal-and-replace discussion. But there's other things that are in the works, too, one of which is the repatriation potentially. You guys have been overseas, in London in particular, for a long period of time. Do you have any significant cash that you might consider bringing back if there is a holiday?","And then my strategic question was, in the last couple of years we've seen payers get involved in purchasing physicians, then they moved to urgent care centers, and now very recently there's been this move to ASC markets. Any thoughts about that? Has that changed the competitive landscape? Has it changed anything that you want to do or just business as usual? Any response to that new competitive evolution?","Victor Campbell -","All right. Hey, A.J, let me let Bill to take the first piece on the repatriation, maybe Sam add some comments on\/","William Rutherford","A.J. real quick on the cash overseas. We have had London international operations. We have approximately $400 million cash overseas that if there's an opportunity that would give us some opportunity to repatriate that, so we\u2019ll just wait to see how certain tax policies may unfold to see how we deal with that progress","A. J. Rice","Okay.","Victor Campbell -","A.J. what\u2019s your second question about payers\u2026.","A. J. Rice","Payers getting into the providers base.","Samuel Hazen","Well, there\u2019s has been significant movement across our markets where payers entering the provider space. Optum and United have made a couple of strategic acquisitions, but they\u2019re sprinkled from one market to the other and they don\u2019t really have what I call it concentrated influence on any one particular market. Obviously, we see opportunities for us to work with the payers as they try to build out providers assistance because what we\u2019re doing as an organization and we\u2019re having discussions with the payers around using our network and our footprint in these areas to accommodate their objectives and we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities there for HCA and other payers to accomplish that.","But we\u2019re not seeing any significant competitive dynamics to-date nor we see it in the foreseeable future coming from those strategic move across the markets, again, within a particular market there could be a bit of concentration around that, but we had some of those situations in the past in markets already and we seem to be able to work with the payers or around the payers in those emphasis to accomplish what we need to get down in those individual market.","A. J. Rice","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Just wanted to understand the comments around capital deployment, you mentioned, both wanting to understand the impacts to the healthcare regulatory environment as well as the tax policy. Which one is more of a driver, in your view? And when you think about the impacts on healthcare, is there an expectation that there may be an acceleration in deals going forward if things do change for the worse? Would you expect the M&A to be a bigger part of this or would you still expect, for the most part, your share purchase to be the biggest use of excess free cash flow","William Rutherford","Kevin, thank you. Milton, do you want to\u2026","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. And Kevin, it\u2019s Milton. You\u2019re asking which one I guess its most important for emphasis health policy changes or tax changes and with respect to our decision around dividend payment, I\u2019d say its equally driven, right now we need to understand how our dividends be tax in the future versus share repurchase opportunities and so you know, we\u2019ll like to have some more clarity around that before we make the decision on a dividend and have a fixed charge on the company.","Obviously health policy is something we\u2019re concern about is well, and we\u2019re following very closely in Washington. So, I can\u2019t really, necessarily rank them because they\u2019re both important into the decision around the dividend. I think with respect to opportunities for acquisitions in this environment, we do have a pipeline today, I\u2019ll comment. I will comment that I think, I will also say as usual, its very difficult to know how some of the opportunities and discussions we\u2019re having will actually turn out, but I will say that the pipeline today is little more robust than it has been in recent years and the transactions feel like they could be more realizeable and that\u2019s just my kind of feel for the market right now.","So, that\u2019s a piece of it, but with our strong cash flow that we have and strong balance sheet, I feel like we\u2019ve got the ability to remain active with the share repurchase program and to be acquisitive. So I don\u2019t see a trade off there, but we would like as I said in my comments, we want to remain at this point conservative with our approach. We won\u2019t maximum financial flexibility for the company to be able to take advantage with opportunities that could come in the coming few months or few years.","So, we will as I said in my comments consider to evaluate our policy around dividends going forward is just in the current environment. We\u2019d like to have more clarity before make any decision, that\u2019s really a permanent decision with respect to the company\u2019s use of cash.","Victor Campbell -","Kevin, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Matthew Borsch at Goldman Sachs. ","Matthew Borsch","Yes, just a question, as you think about potential tax reform in particular, are you trying to get EPS to be the primary earnings metric that investors look at? And is that something that you've found investors are more receptive to as compared to a few years ago?","R. Milton Johnson","Matthew, this is Milton and Bill maybe jump in, but we definitely believe that investor should be looking at EPS. We have been a consistent repurchaser of our stock. We believe we\u2019ve create lot of value for our shareholders since the IPO. I don\u2019t have number top of head, but billions of dollar maybe approaching not to $10 billion of share repurchase since the IPO. So we think that\u2019s a very effective way also very tax effective way to return cash to shareholders and of course this does results in higher growth in EPS. So it is something we will like to investors to focus on with our current strategy.","We think it\u2019s a low risk, late to return cash and create value for our shareholders and so we definitely think that it should be metric that our investors should be paying more attention to.","Victor Campbell -","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","And moving next to Justin Lake at Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to ask one clarification and jump off my question. Sam you said 1.5% growth in patient beds and 4% growth in capacity. Is that annual number and over what period of the day. Just want to confirm.","William Rutherford","It is an annual number. That\u2019s on average, I mean, we have about 38,000 impatient beds that are operational, so the 400 or so that Milton counted, it\u2019s a 1% increase in capacity and then our ER beds we have about 5,000 ER beds so if we\u2019re adding 200 \u2013 150 to 200 then next we\u2019d get to the 4%. Its important to understand that our impatient bed occupancy for the company is at record highs, we\u2019re operating over 70% in patient occupancy utilization on our operating beds. Our emergency room room that utilization is running almost 90% utilization. Again those constraints create some challenge for us in many facilities until our capital can get there. So that's where the numbers come from, Justin. Those are some of the metrics underneath that, and that's how we are thinking about the roll forward there. ","Victor Campbell -","All right. Now we will get to your [ph] questions. ","Operator","And moving next to Josh Raskin at Barclays.","Joshua Raskin","Hi, thanks. Just a question around the outpatient services trend, there maybe specifically ASC volumes with outpatient surgery actually take negative. I am curious if there is something going on, I mean anything that you can point to that would be a change, you think there is now saturation of facilities as there is too much competition, or is it just a one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend and we will see later? ","Samuel Hazen","In general I think it's more of the later than anything else. There hasn\u2019t been a significant amount of new supply Ambulatory Surgery Centres across our markets. We do have some under this movement our physicians from centre to the other that sort of typical we've had pretty good growth of trend and are able to towards surgery centre division, as well as our hospital based outpatient units over the past few years, but the last two quarters has been a little softer than we anticipated.","We do have had company's division showing growth in an half that are down with a variety of reasons driving some of the declines in some of the markets. I was still bullish on both components of our outpatient surgical initiatives. We are investing in capacity in those areas in some markets, we are adding technology and others, and we continue to work with physician to create the environment that they want for their patients. And I anticipate that we will be a back to our normal growth period, our growth trend over the coming periods.","William Rutherford","I just agree with what Sam telling and I am looking here at our freestanding outpatient surgery growth each quarters. This is the first quarter we had negative growth in the line of 8 [ph] to Sam's. So we have been very consistent growth around, one just under 3% and first quarter of 2016 the manufacturing growth was 5%. So it's been a consistent grower for us. This is the first quarter that we had we reported negative growth in freestanding outpatient surgery next quarter. ","Victor Campbell -","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","And we will go next to Jefferies with Brian Tanquilut.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning, guys. Milton, as we think about the ACA obviously a lot of unknowns there, but where guys were sitting right after the election? What's the view or what was the decision internally in terms of like the Plan D [ph] as we think about the potential [Inaudible] appealed in terms of dedication and driving growth going forward? ","R. Milton Johnson","I don\u2019t know think that as we go -- of course lot of uncertainty with respect to our customers that I think what we feel replacement [ph]. I do believe when I think the management team here believe that there will be -- if there is a retail there will be a replacement. What that replacement will look like and how many lives it'll cover, it's been a -- we can't, we don\u2019t know. But I'll say I don\u2019t see it's going back up to the 2024 sort of uninsured volume lies and percentage is population uninsured that we had in 2014. So we had a long history of Brian of being able to react to the market place and to deal with changes in healthcare policy and this is one of the work through I am confident of that. And so I don\u2019t see today any sort of changes and I think we have articulated that in our call this morning changes in our operations and our strategy around operations.","We are moving forward. We are investing capital. We continue to see demand up in our markets. The exchange business is important to us, but it yet it only as about 2.5% of extra little volume. So we watched the market place very, very closely and to be able react to it when we see change coming. And this is one of the situations we are going to continue to do that. This next year we will be watching the market very closely as we get more clarity around how we think health policy changes if any in the next two, three years it will impact ACA. We will be very clear and articulating that to our investors and trying to quantify any potential impact.","But today we remain very optimistic with our guidance for 2017 and then we will have to see how things work out later in the year. ","Victor Campbell -","All right. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we will move on to Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the commercial mix decline, it's been negative for first quarters now and Sam I know you usually cite market share stats and given update to that. I know it's a difficult like [ph] six months but any visibility there will be helpful? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","The market share data that we have, which is most current is through the second quarter of 2016. Our overall market share is flat. So we have seen some pressures on our overall market share where we are flat at around 25% for that 12 months, period ending second quarter of 2016. I think there are two issues for overall market share being flat. One, we have seen increased competition as I have mentioned in the past in the form of new facilities in a lot of our markets both on the in patient side and the outpatient side and we can point to that as a fairly significant contributor to some of the pressure.","And then the second point which cause right back into our capital discussion as we do have significant capacity constraints in a number of our facilities that are poised for growth. I understand we get this capital along, we think that will open up some market share opportunities for the company. On a commercial side, we have seen a little bit of drop in our market share, it's isolated to a handful of markets, but they happened to be big commercial markets for ACA where we've seen an accelerated level of competition in some of these suburban markets where there is density of commercial lot. We have what we think our responsible strategies for dealing with that that\u2019s where urgent care outreach, some of physician imitative and markeing strategies, we think are going to help in that particular funds, but it is quite competitive on the commercial side in many of our markets.","Victor Campbell -","Thank you, Ralph.","Operator","And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick at Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thank you so much. So it was top comp and not an easy business ever, so good job. And thank you for the guidance and the explanation. I want to put it -- dig in a little bit more into your thought process so about the 2017 and then preparing perhaps for changes in the ACA. So for 2017 you help me think about how if you are positioning the company vis-\u00e0-vis what we seem to see in the rest of the industry which is declining inpatient utilization coupled with what sounds like some changes in the dynamic with managed care in some of your markets, when do you start seeing that pressure reverse, is it a second half 2017, where do you start to get that the list of the investment you are making versus the competition and maybe gaining back some of that commercial market share, or are we likely to see some increasing pressure of managed care trying to outpatient at the hospital and balancing that out we kind of look the way we do it beginning of the year, because I think that volume assumption is really key to the guidance. And then also what preparations then you are making this year to the potential for having more uninsured next year?","R. Milton Johnson","So let me -- well first of all we don\u2019t believe that inpatient utilization is declining we think ACA market is growing because of population trends, because the aging of the baby boomers the kind of clinical technologies, all those things that have been driving demand historically are going to drop demand in the future at least in the intermediate run we believe that clearly we had a five and six quarters cycle that was accelerated demand that we experienced tremendous volume growth that part of the comparison challenges that we had in the past year.","But we have seen a sort of normalized where we believe the markets are going to yield inpatient demand growth of roughly 2% across our market. As far as any managed care activities I don\u2019t think that there is any unique managed care utilization management initiatives or care model initiatives that are impacting the market in any significant way. Possibly on the fringes [ph] here they are not anything at its core and how it's impacting overall demand, nor we see that in the short run to intermediate run either. So those two dynamics aren\u2019t really evident across ACA's market.","With respect to our capital and some of our initiatives that amount of money is travelling in throughout the year. It feathers in in 2016, a lot of our projects come in online at different points of 2017, 2018, and so forth. So is difficult to say that there's a bolus that's going to hit in the last half of the year for the first half of the year that's going to change our volume prospects. It tends to feather itself into our overall capacity and opportunities over sort of a consistent kind of timeline where just happening from month to month to month. And so we're not anticipating anything unique. As far as changing our model and approach to the prospects for growing uninsured, this past year our uninsured activity was flat to down. I think Bill, in total...","William Rutherford","4% growth. We were down in the fourth quarter.","Sheryl Skolnick","Yeah in the fourth quarter. And we've gone through cycles where payer mix have shifted a bit, clearly for us it\u2019s the variable cost that we would incur in taking care of those patient's. As the incremental impact obviously be -- if the Affordable Care Act strips away a 100% of the insurance like Milton was saying, that's a different dynamic for us, but I don't think it significantly changes our core strategy maybe some things on the fringes around how we pace initiatives or how we do certain decision making around that. But we still have opportunities we believe on the core operations of HCA and that they can continue to yield value for the company.","Samuel Hazen","All right, thanks, Sheryl.","Operator","And moving next to Gary Lieberman at Wells Fargo. Sir?","Gary Lieberman","Good morning, thanks. You did a good job of controlling labor expense in the quarter. Can you talk about the more broad pressures you're seeing on labor supply and how much of that is a risk to your numbers in 2017 and then maybe just comment on the robust, taller growth that you saw this year?","Samuel Hazen","Okay, this is Sam again. On labor expenses I\u2019m really pleased with how the company was able to manage it for labor expenses this year. We saw the modest productivity improvement which I think is somewhat of a reflection of the operating leverage that we have from the volume growth. We were able to moderate our contract labor growth for the year. It was only up 6% for the quarter, it was up 4% nursing continues to be a challenge for the company but we are making progress with a number of our initiatives around on boarding nursing, around training nurses, around recruitment in those areas and we still continue to manage that particular component of our expense structure effectively. The trends going forward are modestly under pressure compared to this past year we are expecting wages to be up a little bit, maybe 50 basis points over where they were but that\u2019s embedded in the guidance that Bill gave.","From the supply and other expense standpoint no significant inflationary pressures that we see at this particular point in those categories that will create any unusual risk in our expense structure for 2016. So we feel pretty good about where the company is. From that standpoint we have a host of initiatives underneath our expense structure that are driving toward efficiencies and we continue to evolve those, they center around better labor management approaches with one HR platform, our performance improvement change which we\u2019ve talked about in the past continue to find opportunity to enhance processes in our facilities and efficiencies and in our clinical agenda it\u2019s continuing to identify opportunities to improve supply cost utilization, blood utilization, better patient length of stay and those kind of thing. So the combination of those are still a positive opportunity for HCA and one in which we believe we can execute on and mitigate some of these pressures. Thank you Gary.","Operator","And our next question is from John Ransom at Raymond James.","John Ransom","Hi, my question has been answered. Thanks.","Operator","Great. Thank you.","Samuel Hazen","John, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll move next to Michael Newshel at Evercore ISI.","Michael Newshel","Thanks, good morning. With the caveat as you said earlier is getting harder to estimate, but could you just confirm what you think ACA contributed to EBITDA in 2016 and whether that's in line with what you're expecting?","William Rutherford","Yes it did in discover [ph] it in line with our expectations. We said this is contributing 5% to 6% of adjusted EBITDA and that\u2019s a double [Indiscernible] 2016.","Michael Newshel","Okay. Thanks.","William Rutherford","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel at Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel","Thanks, if you can give us an update on the Florida Medicaid outpatient rate cuts and what you are assuming in guidance and I know that you and some of your peers have been protesting those so just interested if there\u2019s an update on that process there.","R. Milton Johnson","No there are several offers to try to adjust that, but it does not have a material impact on HCA or inside our guidance for 2017.","Scott Fidel","All right.","R. Milton Johnson","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gary Taylor at JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Hi good morning. I have a kind of a two part on CapEx just because it's such a big part of the strategy. It's more than doubled since the IPO. It's running almost 7% of revenues in the 2017 guidance, which I think is around the highest in the decade. So the two part question is, is there a point where you see absolute CapEx dollars coming down? Are we kind of rolling on a kind of a bolus CapEx cycle and that could slow?","And just the reason I ask is, I know you're trying to point investors towards earnings, but in 2016 there were $2.7 billion in CapEx and only $1.9 billion of depreciation so there's certainly some EPS benefit that isn\u2019t reflected in free cash flow program and just wondering when those two numbers might narrow?","Samuel Hazen","Gary, let me take a shot at it but this is Sam and then Bill also may also have some comments on it. So our capital spending is really a direct reflection of the opportunities we see in the marketplace and demand that we see. Sam was talking about in certain markets if we don't invest and expand to add more capacity than our growth will be limited by lack of capacity. So we're trying to stay up to speed of that or ahead of that. And so we have been increasing our capital spend upto record levels. Quite frankly at the same time, as Bill mentioned in his comments we have been reporting and seeing a record levels of return on invested capitals as we\u2019ve been spinning more capitals.","So I think those investments have turned out to be very solid and good investments and value creating opportunities for our shareholders. Now if the marketplace changes, we certainly have the ability to ratchet down capital spending. And so we've been through different cycles before. When we went through the recession back in 2009, it takes a little while to ratchet down, because the project is in process, but we didn\u2019t have the ability, and we demonstrated the ability to slow it down based on market needs, and the like.","So and so I don't see today as being any different. So right now, we're seeing demand in our markets and we're investing too meet the requirements of that demand and again, I've been quite pleased with the return overall on the investments that we've been making.","Victor Campbell","Gary, I think we got time for maybe one more question.","Operator","We will go next to Paula Torch at Avondale Partners.","Paula Torch","Hey thanks for fitting me in. I was just curious about on patient access and maybe going back to the growth in the ER beds. Wondering where that's coming from in particular, is it mostly growth in the freestanding ED space or is it hospital ER beds? And just given the competition that's increasing in the freestanding ED space, are you spreading that growth to other markets that you have where this just less competition? Or are you still seeing growth in some of your more concentrated areas?","Samuel Hazen","Let me give you some facility numbers. First Paula, this is Sam again. On the urgent care side, we operate 72 urgent care centers today. And we believe to be somewhere around 120 urgent care centers by the end of the year. The freestanding emergency rooms we operate roughly 62, I think today. One of them just got converted to a hospital yesterday actually, it opened in Orlando, Florida so we're down to 61 I think as a result of that conversion. But we should be somewhere around 80 freestanding emergency rooms in operation by the first part of 2018.","But when you look at the bed top of emergency rooms beds growth, it's a blend of between probably 50-50, thereabouts. I don't have the exact number of the top of my head but it's pretty close to that, between hospital ER bed expansion as well as freestanding emergency room expansion. I do think some of the market dynamics for freestanding emergency rooms has slowed a bit. We're not anticipating the growth in competitor units in 2017 that we've seen in the past 24 months. And so we see opportunities for HCA to deploy these facilities strategically across various markets to put our network in the best position they can possibly be. All right, Paula, is that helpful?","Paula Torch","Thank you. That was helpful.","Samuel Hazen","You are very welcome. I want to thank everyone for being on today\u2019s call. We look forward to talking to you and seeing you soon.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, once again that does conclude today\u2019s conference. And again I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today."],"11019":["HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) Q1 2018 Earnings Call May  1, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Victor L.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Lynette, thank you, and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call; also welcome those of you who are listening to our webcast. With me here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before I turn the call over to Milt, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today.","Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.

In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. excluding losses, gains on sales of facility, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. This morning we issued our first quarter 2018 earnings release, and overall, we are pleased with the results from the first quarter. Revenue growth supported by growth in volume and rate along with good expense management resulted in solid adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter of 2018. We were pleased that we're able to close the divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities and the acquisition of Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia, during the quarter.","First quarter results were solid with revenues totaling $11.423 billion, up 7.5% from the previous year's first quarter, and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $1.144 billion or $3.18 per diluted share, which compares to $659 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 quarterly results included gains on sales of facilities of $405 million or $0.85 per diluted share, related primarily to the sale of our Oklahoma facilities. We also recognized a benefit to our tax revision of $92 million or $0.26 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements, which compares to $67 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the previous year's first quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.118 billion, up 5.6% from the prior year's $2.005 billion. Adjusted EBITDA growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 310 basis points, related to the sale of the OU assets, and our recent acquisitions.","Volume trends were solid in first quarter with our reported admissions and equivalent admissions, each increasing 4.6% over the prior year. Same facility admissions increased 2.2%, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.8% in the quarter, compared to the prior year period. While the first quarter 2018 same facility ER visits increased 3.5% compared to the prior year.","Cash flows from operations remain strong at $1.3 billion in the quarter. We continued a balanced approach to investing and capital expenditures in our existing markets and repurchasing our shares while also completing select acquisitions. We invested $694 million in capital projects during the first quarter of 2018, repurchased 4.37 million shares at a cost of $423 million and paid a dividend of $123 million during the quarter.","Also, during the first quarter, as previously mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia. We're excited to enter this new market in Georgia and believe it will complement our existing operations along the southern Atlantic Coast. We also completed the divestiture of Oklahoma facilities on February 1, 2018 for proceeds of $758 million.","As reported, we have signed a non-binding letter of intent to purchase Mission Health based in Asheville, North Carolina. Mission is a system of six hospitals combined with several other sites of care in western North Carolina. We are excited to move forward with our due diligence and exclusive discussions with this outstanding organization. I believe we are well-positioned for growth as we continue to invest capital in large growing markets, execute our growth agenda, and deliver high quality care for our patients.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter. As we reported in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 10.2% over the prior year and same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.8%. Our same facility admissions for our United States domestic operations increased by 2.4% over the prior year and adjusted admissions increased by 2%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some results by payer class.","During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 9.5% on a same facility basis and represent 36.3% for total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions were flat, while equivalent admissions declined 0.8% in the quarter. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.1% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 7.3%. These represent 7.4% of our total admissions compared to 6.8% last year. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions.","Managed care, other, and exchange admissions increased 1%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.1% of our total ER visits in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 18.4% in the prior year.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.4% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries declined 0.2% in the quarter, the same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 0.3% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.5% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter.","Our same facility managed care, other, and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.8% in the quarter, relatively consistent with recent trends. With the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, we no longer report a provision for doubtful accounts or bad debts as a separate line item. Our previously reported bad debts are now referred to as implicit price concessions.","Our total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care, and uninsured discounts was $6.252 billion in the quarter, as compared to $5.327 billion as reported in the prior year. This reflects growth from uninsured volume, pricing trends, as well as our recent acquisitions. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had no material impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition.","Now, turning to expenses and operating margins. Our as reported EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points from 18.9% in the first quarter last year to 18.5% on an as reported basis. Our recent acquisition had an 80 basis points unfavorable impact on EBITDA margins. Our same facility EBITDA margins increased approximately 40 basis points over the prior year.","Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.5% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues were 46.3% compared to 46.1% in the last year's first quarter. On a same facility basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 43.1% versus 43.2% last year, and same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable.","Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.8% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in the last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.7% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. Other operating expenses increased 30 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.5% of revenues. On a same store basis, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat compared to prior year.","Let me just discuss briefly the impact of the acquisitions and divestitures. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.6% was negatively impacted by our acquisitions and divestitures. We closed on the divestiture of OU operations on February 1 of this year. This negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the impact of our recent acquisitions negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 160 basis points in the quarter.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.3 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year's Q1. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion less capital expenditures of $694 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of $92 million, and dividends paid to shareholders of $123 million, was $391 million in the quarter compared to the $564 million in the first quarter of 2017.","At the end of the quarter, we had $1.77 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.99 times at March 31, 2018 compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%, as we benefited from the lower tax rate resulting from tax reform and $92 million or $0.26 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements.","Let me speak for a moment on our earnings per share of $3.18 this quarter compared to the $1.74 per share we recorded in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 results include the $405 million, or $0.85 per share gain on sale of facilities. Excluding this gain, earnings per share grew approximately 34% as compared to the prior year. We attribute approximately $0.20 to the tax reform benefit and an incremental $0.08 due to equity award benefit based on $0.26 this year versus $0.18 in the prior year. Lastly, we estimate our divestiture of our OU operations, coupled with the impact of recent acquisitions, had approximately $0.13 negative impact on EPS in the quarter as compared to the prior year.","Let me talk briefly about health insurance exchange. In the first quarter, our same facility health exchange admissions increased 4.4% over prior year and represent approximately 2.5% of our total admissions. Same facility health exchange ER visits increased 6.6% over prior year and represent 2.4% of our total ER visits.","So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, good morning. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year. My comments will focus on our same facilities domestic operation. In general, we had broad-based growth across most of our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in six divisions: North Texas, North Florida, Capital, San Antonio, Central Texas, and Tennessee divisions. Conversely, our East Florida, Far West and Mountain divisions were down. 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 23% while hospital-based emergency room visits increased 1.2%. Once again, growth was stronger in high-acuity visits, but we did see growth in lower-acuity visits also.","Admissions through the emergency room grew by 3.5%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 1%. Surgical admissions were 26% of total admissions in the quarter, generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were mostly flat in both our hospital-based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries.","Behavioral Health admissions grew 4.2%. Rehab admissions grew 4.8%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 1.3%. Births were up 0.3%, which is the first quarter we have seen growth in two years. Neonatal admissions were down slightly at 0.6%, however, neonatal patient days were up 3.2%, an indication of a higher level of acuity in these units. Urgent care visits for the company were up 14% on a same facility basis and 34% in total.","The flu season in the quarter had a positive impact on our admissions and emergency room visits. Approximately 29% of our admission growth was flu related and approximately 50% of our emergency room visits growth was flu related.","HCA has now grown same facilities admissions and emergency room visits in 16 consecutive quarters. We believe this consistent pattern of growth is a result of positive macro factors in our markets and a comprehensive growth agenda that is both well-resourced and well executed.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thank you, Sam. All right, with that, we're ready to take calls, Lynette, or take questions. And please limit yourself to one as we have several on here that probably would like to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take the first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, this is Steve Baxter on for Justin. I was hoping that you could explain sort of the progression of some of the newly acquired facilities that you mentioned as being an EBITDA drag. I guess, could you size for us how much revenue fits in that bucket and how quickly those margins will progress over time and whether getting to company average margins is kind of realistic, given the starting point there?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Steve, thank you. Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I'll start and you can add in. So, our new acquisitions contributed about $320 million of revenue in the quarter and principally comprised of our acquisitions in Houston towards the last year and then, as Milt mentioned in his comments, Memorial Savannah is a recent acquisition closed on February 1. Going to Savannah, we knew that was going to take a longer term to bring that up to reasonable margin expectations. I think, in our previous acquisitions in Houston, it's on the chassis of an existing division, so we are optimistic there's going to be continued improvements occurring through the balance of the year and they'll contribute to the long-term growth of the company.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","All right.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","We'll move to the next caller in the queue, Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was hoping that you could talk to the impact you think you might get and perhaps the probability that you see of a Medicaid expansion in Virginia.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Matt, I'll go ahead and take that. This is Vic. Touched base with our Virginia folks this morning. I think, they are reasonably optimistic that Medicaid may expand. It likely will have some employment qualifications with it, so it's hard to know the full impact. But we won't know for sure until probably sometime in May as to whether or not it does expand or not.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on 14% urgent care growth. I think you said that was actually same-store basis. And so, I'm curious if there's targeted approaches, you guys doing something differently in the market around your urgent cares, or maybe some of that just flu this quarter?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, I think it's a combination of both. There were clearly flu activity in our urgent care centers. I don't have the specific metric on that. We have continued to add to our overall portfolio of urgent care centers. We're up to a roughly 125, I think, compared to maybe 80 or so last year at this particular point in time, so quite a bit of growth in our overall urgent care center development, which is a very important component of our overall provider system offerings. And so, the company had been very intentional about adding urgent care centers, which is a low-cost capital entry into certain markets. It's a very efficient price point for our payers and our patients, and it starts a relationship in many instances with new patients that allow us to introduce the HCA system to them.","I think, we will continue to see growth. We have moderated the development somewhat in 2018 in order to absorb and assimilate the number of centers that we've added over the last 18 months, but we anticipate picking up the pace again in 2019 and 2020 as we continue to evolve this particular component.","In addition to that, we have our freestanding emergency room center development, which is complementary to that. We have roughly 75 freestanding emergency room centers across the company, with another 45 to 50 that are in development. Again, complementing our inpatient offerings and then also complementing our urgent care center strategy as well. So, the combination of both of those are very important to our provider system development.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Josh, thank you.","Operator","A. J. Rice from Credit Suisse, your line is open.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe, I'll just ask about some payer dynamics. I know, you have a Medicare proposed rule on the table that has some interesting provisions on it. And then also just an update on where you stand with your managed care contracting and are you seeing any change in terms or change in approach to the business?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, A. J., this is Vic. I'll take the Medicare piece of it and then I think, Bill Rutherford will talk about managed care contracting. As you saw last week, we did see the IPPS proposed rule. Still it's proposed, we're still running numbers and looking at it. On balance, it looks better than what we have seen in recent years. I think, as you all know Medicare inpatient rates, they've ranged anywhere from up to 0.5 point to maybe 1.5 in recent years. This looks a little better for next year. We'll wait and see how it plays out when we see the final rule in August. But net-net, it does look a little better. Bill or Sam, you want to talk about managed care?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","A. J., on the managed care side of the equation and we've been saying this consistently now for multiple years, there are very few structural changes in how we have contracted and our trends on pricing on the commercial side of the equation. Our company has been very productive, I think, in building out competitive, relevant provider systems across our 42 domestic markets. And that's allowed us to have, I think, productive discussions with the payers on how to add value on their side, how to add value for their members and ultimately how to add value for HCA.","So those discussions continue. We're largely contracted for 2018. We have roughly half of our 2019 and 30% of our 2020 portfolio contracted. I anticipate that accelerating over the next 90 to 120 days in both of those two years. But for the most part, our terms, our conditions, our network configurations and the value-based components of those contracts are relatively consistent with the past and aren't going through any material changes.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Sam. Thank you, A. J.","Operator","Moving next to Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just parsing through a lot of different metrics, it maybe seems like outpatient surgeries may have been just a touch softer than you guys thought. But there's obviously a lot going on. And I'm wondering just broadly if you think what you're seeing may be consistent with sort of an increased seasonality this year, maybe in part due to a bigger increase in deductibles or that sort of thing?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Anybody want to take a run at that?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Sam again. I don't think that we can point to any unusual seasonality driving outpatient activity. I've heard people talk about, well, the heavy flu season resulted in people choosing not to have surgery. I can't really find that in any explanation from our teams. We actually grew our hospital-based outpatient surgeries very modestly, and we're down very modestly in our ambulatory surgery center divisions. A lot of that was because of the soft start that we had in the first week-and-a-half of the quarter. And again, I can't point to that. We actually accelerated outpatient surgical activity as we moved through the quarter, but for whatever reason the first week-and-a-half or two weeks were very soft, and it compromised the overall quarter's performance.","We continue to remain focused on building out our outpatient surgery capabilities across the company. We're adding ambulatory surgery centers to our overall portfolio of offerings within each of our markets. We're continuing to add physicians as investors in many of these centers. And within our hospitals, we're able to create a very efficient outpatient environment for our surgeons who want to also operate on inpatients at the same time. And we think the combination of those offerings is very competitive and very responsive to our different constituents. But we're not seeing anything unusual in any particular market that would suggest any macro trend changes or seasonality or anything of that nature.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Milt, did you want to add?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","No. I mean I just think that, I mean obviously just to add this one point. We have been seeing in the last several years, many years, more surgical volume in the fourth quarter. And so what Sam I think's referring to, we don't think that that's accelerated or changed. It's been a consistent trend for a number of years, and we continue, I think, to see that for the fourth quarter being a really strong surgical quarter for us and typically over the last several years, the first quarter has been a lower surgical quarter for us. So, that trend hasn't changed this year in any material sense.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Good, thank you. Thank you, Steve.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Can you talk about the Florida Medicaid rebid results for managed care? You saw a number of shifts in providers. Do you think that's going to help you guys in terms of picking up more business from in the Florida Medicaid, as we move to those new contracts?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Bill or Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","We have not seen across HCA's markets any significant Medicaid participation changes. So, we've been pretty stable on that environment. The issue for us is the recapture of outpatient reimbursement that was inappropriately implemented inside of the Florida state administrative process. So, we're hopeful that issue gets resolved and we recover the reimbursement that has been not applied properly. But from a managed care standpoint, we don't have any significant changes in our overall participation within the different networks. And we feel pretty good about where we are in total.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. I'm talking about going forward.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Peter?","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","In 2019, because the rebid just happened, and we've just seen the results, and you've seen Humana, in particular, is one of the bigger winners. I know they're one of the bigger contractors for you. And so, I'm curious if that's going to result in more business coming your way in 2019.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I don't have any visibility into that at this particular point in time, changing in any significant way our volume trends in the state.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Pete.","Operator","Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Obviously, you're reaffirming your guidance today, but as I go back through and look at some of the underlying assumptions around your guidance, both from a volume and pricing standpoint, it looks like you're clearly ahead of schedule from the pricing side. So I'm just curious, how sustainable do you think the level of pricing growth that you have seen will be throughout the year? And certainly, from the volume side, it seems like some things are ramping back up there as well. So just wanted commentary on those two main drivers to your guidance.","And then finally, I think Bill mentioned the growth in the uninsured volumes here. I'm just curious, how much of growth of uninsured volumes did you actually build into your guidance for 2018? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Frank. Thank you. Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. Let me try to make it. Yes, we are reaffirming our broad-brush guidance with our earnings kind of slightly above what our expectations were and others. I think we feel pretty good about that. Earnings per share was strong in the quarter, obviously. And I think that may push us on the higher end of that. All of our other major guidance after first quarter, we feel comfortable with and continue to affirm, and we'll obviously revisit that after the second quarter.","As you know, our broad-brush guidance was 2% to 3% volume expectations, and 2% to 3% pricing expectations. We're within the volume for the first quarter. As you mentioned, pricing was favorable, driven by continued strong case-mix index that we started to see in the fourth quarter. So again, we'll keep our eye on that, but again, very displeased with the performance that we have off to the start of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate our guidance as we go through Q2.","Regarding uninsured volumes, yes, we did report 10%. We had been seeing 5% and 6% towards the last half of 2017 growth. We've said before, based on our market complexion, I anticipate really a high single digit and that's kind of built into what our expectations are. As you've heard us talk about, and as you know, Florida and Texas represent about 70% of our uninsured volume and they contributed about 50% of the uninsured volume growth.","That number can fluctuate from time to time as you have different kind of processes going on with Medicaid applications and so forth, so there are some timing issues that affect uninsured and when they may become Medicaid eligible. But in essence, this high single digit is built into kind of reasonable expectations for us. And obviously, I'll just remind everyone that the real impact of the growing uninsured is just that the incremental cost that we have to treat these patients, and I think with what we have built into our expectations, we can manage that and absorb that through the overall context of the core operations.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Let me add to that. This is Sam, Frank. I think when I look at our revenue growth in the fourth quarter and our revenue growth in the first quarter, both of them are pushing 6% on the domestic side of the equation as far as overall revenue growth. And part of that has been solid volume. And then obviously, we've had very good revenue per adjusted admission. Not all of that is coming from pricing. A piece of that is pricing. Part of it is coming from mix in the type of patients that we're getting, number one, and then the payer mix improving, number two.","So, the combination of those two things has yielded revenue growth on the upper side of where we thought we might be, and so, those are positive metrics, we believe, and they really relate to significantly better revenue growth than what we had seen over the past six or eight quarters. And so, that's on a same facilities basis, so we're pretty pleased with how that's played itself out. And we think as we indicated throughout last year that the market would start to move more toward a normal growth rate in overall demand. Now, we don't have the fourth quarter market share data yet. We have the third quarter, and we're starting to see, we believe, some transition back to that normal growth rate that we were expecting on overall demand, and that's what's playing out.","The other thing, I would say, is that in the quarter, we had tremendous inpatient revenue growth. Our revenue growth was about 7.3% on the inpatient side and roughly 4% on the outpatient side. That confuses some of the adjusted admission statistics, but it's a reflection of the acuity that we had inside of our inpatient business in the face of flu admissions in the quarter. So, very significant acuity across our inpatient book. And again, that's part of our strategy in trying to create more complex, deeper capabilities within our service lines so that we can take care of patients when they need really acute care inpatient needs. So, all of that sort of plays into how we're evaluating this quarter, and really the fourth quarter, as well.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Right. Frank, thank you.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Sarah James from Piper Jaffray, your line is open.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to get your thoughts on some of the trends that are impacting payer mix, sort of more over the intermediate term. So first, the insurers are starting to talk about employers shifting their retirees over to straight Medicare as opposed to being part of their commercial coverage books. Is that impactful for you at all if that trend continues? And then second, we're seeing consumers that are kind of in the pre-Medicare age group like 63 to 64 starting to more frequently delay their surgeries in order to wait until they get Medicare-eligible because their cost share is lower. So, how are those two factors factoring into how you think about your Medicare payer mix going forward? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Somebody want to take a wing at that?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Milt. Maybe I'll start by saying, I don't think we have any measurable data to drill down on those questions. I'm not aware of in our markets hearing any noise about shifting the benefits for retirees of corporate America, and that's not bubbled up as an issue for us. And certainly, whether there's deferrals of surgery for people approaching Medicare eligibility, I don't know that would be a new trend if it's out there. So again, really can't, I think, respond to that with any credible sort of data.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. And I think if you \u2013 again, if you just look at our numbers on the quarter, you look at the Medicare, growth was 2.5% to 3%. And really the number that sort of materially changed in my mind was the managed care exchange number, which was up 1% to 1.2% on admission and adjusted admission, when that was substantially better than what we've seen in recent quarters. So those are good mix shifts and good volumes.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. And this is Milt. As Sam mentioned, the payer mix in this particular quarter is actually quite favorable with managed care admission growth up 1%. And in the quarter \u2013 and that's the highest growth that we've had in probably going back into the first quarter of 2016. So again, the payer mix trends here in the quarter actually are pretty positive for us. Yeah.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you were making earlier about the positive surprise in the acuity and the revenue per admission. And it feels like \u2013 I don't want to make any kind of trend assumptions, but a couple of your peers had pretty high acuity, as well. Was wondering if \u2013 when you look at this, is this because of specific service line improvements and you picking up share of higher acuity procedures and services from your competition or are you beginning to see kind of a floor, if you will, on how much mix is shifting from inpatient to other sites of service? And is that in any way correlated with payer mix and capacity utilization if you look at those things? And do you think this is a sustainable trend of 3 to 4-plus percent pricing growth?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Ana. Sam or...","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, we've had a \u2013 I think now \u2013 Bill, help me if I'm wrong, but five or six straight quarters of fairly significant case mix.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Index growth across HCA, more in the mid 3s or so in the first part of 2017, and then trending up above 4% in the latter half of 2017 and the first part of 2018. I think it's a combination of things, as you just indicated. It's difficult for me to point to them specifically, but we've had growth in a surgical activity in higher acuity surgical service lines like cardiovascular and orthopedic. On the medicine side of the equation, in both our neonatal units, as well as our adult critical care units, we've seen a more acute medical patient. That's part of it.","We've clearly added service lines across HCA, whether it's trauma, burn, neurosciences and stroke capabilities in our facilities that results in a much more acute care offering when a patient requires that type of service. So, all of those converge \u2013 and this is not anything new. We've been talking about this being a core element of our strategy for the last 4 or 5 years. We think some of this is a yield from that. It's a yield from our capital spending. It's a yield from service line development. It's a yield from network integration. All of these pieces and parts add up. And this is a slow-moving business.","And so, we think from that standpoint, it yields over time very positive metrics, and is central, like I said, to the strategic approach that we're taking within each of our markets. So, I can't really say that outpatient \u2013 transition from inpatient to outpatient is changing materially. If I had to pick, I would pick more toward our strategic approach, our development of service lines, our integration of our networks, yielding more of the growth than the slowdown in transition from inpatient to outpatient.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you and have a good quarter.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Ana, thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Matthew Gillmor from Baird.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. I want to ask about the geographic discussion. Sam mentioned East Florida and the Far West as being weaker from an admissions perspective. I think you've called those markets out before. So, can you just give us a sense for the dynamics in those markets?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yes. East Florida continues to struggle with the issue that we've mentioned in the past, which is the observation statusing by many of our Medicare advantage payers and that's driven their inpatient volume metric down somewhat. Now, the growth in that issue was a little slower in the first quarter than what it was in 2017, but it continues to be a metric issue. We did have solid financial growth in the East Florida. Far West division is more of a California dynamic and our California hospitals struggled with their volume. Vegas was decent, that's also in the Far West division.","And then in the Mountain division, which is primarily Utah and Idaho, we had some softness in our Idaho operations from a volume standpoint that brought the division down, but they were modestly down, and they weren't down as much as East Florida and Far West, but they were one of the divisions that were down. So, nothing strategic there of any significance. The Far West division and our California hospitals, I think, have some opportunities and we're making what I think to be some appropriate adjustments to deal with some of the dynamics there, and hopefully put us back on a growth platform in those markets.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thanks, Matthew.","Operator","We'll hear next from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Sam, just a follow-up to your answers to the last two questions. So as I think about the capital spending for the last three years and all the bed adds that you've done and seeing inpatient growth finally reaccelerate, how are you thinking about the ramp in terms of the productivity of the new beds that you're adding? And any quantification you can give us in terms of new capacity that has been added over the last two years just for us to be able to gauge kind of like the outlook in terms of being able to fill those beds and what kind of growth we should be looking at for that?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I don't have all of those metrics in front of me, but I mean that's a piece of our \u2013 it's been a piece of our strategy, so it's in elements of our growth in the past. Having said that, we do have more capital coming online in 2018, 2019, and 2020 than we've had in recent years, so we're anticipating some acceleration in growth in those facilities as those capital items come online.","It's important to understand, these capital projects are long-lived projects. They're very important to our long-term positioning in the market and very important to our strategy of being able to transition patients from outpatient centers to inpatient centers when they need more acute care. So, we have to have that inpatient capacity.","Obviously, our outpatient capital starts to yield much more quickly as we get freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers, imaging centers, or ambulatory surgery centers online. Those tend to produce more timely than a longer lived inpatient asset capacity growth will. But we need to get \u2013 we'll get back to you on some color around how we're thinking about that. I just don't have that particular metric in front of me, and I don't want to guess at it at this particular point.","But obviously, the company is operating, as we said before, at a high watermark on inpatient utilization. We're operating at almost 72%, on average inpatient occupancy, and in many instances, we have hospitals that are operating much higher than that. And so, it's important for us to have the inpatient capacity in order to receive the full benefit of our network development.","On the outpatient side, in our emergency rooms in particular, as I've indicated in the past, we're running almost 90% utilization of our emergency room bed capacity, which is a very good metric of productivity, and such. And again, very important to our overall network strategy that we have ample capacity available when patients need our emergency room services. So, those are pushes as well on why we're spending money, but it also complements some of the service line development, physician strategies, and so forth that we have already mentioned on today's call.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Anything else, anybody? Okay. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks, good morning. I know you said labor costs are relatively stable, but going forward, do you expect to see any pressure there from inflation or increased competition for hiring or retention, given the tight labor market for nursing?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Sam again. We're really pleased with how our facilities have responded. I guess it's been almost two years ago that we had some struggles with contract labor utilization, especially in our nursing areas. And at that particular point in time, our turnover for nurses was somewhere around 21% or 22%. We've actually dropped that particular metric to around 17%. That improvement, along with our comprehensive nursing agenda that the company has, and our human resource agenda, the combination of those is yielding, we believe, very positive results.","Our contract labor on nursing was down almost 15% in the quarter, and we've seen overall contract labor drop for HCA. That has yielded a cost for FTE of around 2.8% I think or so in the quarter, which is a pretty good metric and in line with our expectations. Clearly, from one market to the other, we will have dynamics in the nursing community that we have to respond to with compensation programs and other type of programs, but the company's workforce development, the company's nursing agenda, and our ongoing connection to the marketplace and adjustments associated with that, we believe allow us to manage through these dynamics in a way that's not putting any undue pressure on the labor line at this point.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America, your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Want to get a little more color on the uninsured volume. It's up pretty significantly, I guess, at a time when the economy is doing about as well as you could expect. Do you know what it is that's driving that type of volume? Is it the service lines that you're expanding that are bringing that in?","And then to your point about how you view this as a good payer mix quarter, even with a 10% increase in uninsured volume. At what point does it become, I guess, a drag to earnings or is it really more about commercial? If commercial is up 1%, then it's kind of hard to come up with a bad payer mix on the rest of the business.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Bill. Let me give a try on there. So, we did report 10%, and I think as I said earlier, if you look towards the latter half of 2017, we were in that 5% to 6%. So, it is slightly up from where we were running. Honestly, I'm not sure I can give you a whole lot of detail on why. We continue to hear from time to time in certain states slowdown of processing Medicaid applications that has a potential, potentially impacting the uninsured volume in any one quarter. Not really sure. But imagine flu may have had an impact on this, as we saw increased traffic in the emergency room.","I think we go back to \u2013 really we don't see anything structural here, nor do I judge this increase to be a material factor for HCA, as we know. The impact is the incremental variable cost. So, we can accommodate that within the context of our overall guidance. So, we'll have to wait for a few more quarters. As I said earlier, I think our anticipation is we settle in that kind of high single-digit year-over-year trends and at those levels, I think we can manage through that. And we'll have to see how that plays out through the balance of the year.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Milt, did you want to add something?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I was going to add \u2013 I think this quarter, too \u2013 first quarter of last year was a low watermark for uninsured activity. I'm looking at \u2013 this is not the same stores consolidated numbers, a little bit higher than same stores, but we had 34,000 uninsured admissions in the first quarter of 2017. We had just over 38,000. So about 4,000 increase roughly. But when you look at the fourth quarter of 2017, we had almost 40,000.","So, actually, we're down on a sequential basis first quarter to fourth quarter in terms of uninsured admissions. So, I think part of this percentage increase here in the first quarter is attributable to a comp last year where we were pretty low volume for uninsureds. And I would think, as we go throughout the year, I still think our assumption around high single digits is going to be a good assumption for us.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Good, thank you. Thank you, Kevin. About one or two more questions. We're running out of time here.","Operator","Next is Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the first question and make sure I got the impact of Oklahoma and the deal. Sounds like that was about a 310 basis point drag on EBITDA. So, is the way to think about that, normalized EBITDA growth closer to 8.5%, is that right? And then the Oklahoma pressure is going to remain, but again, can you help with sort of the ramp of the new deals and when you'd expect more incremental contribution as we think about sort of the balance of the year?","And if I could sneak in one more, same facility EBITDA growth, can you actually give us what that is because you said margins expanded and same store revenue was up 5.7%, so EBITDA growth on a same store basis is going to be even higher than that? Just trying to get the magnitude there. Thanks.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, let me take this. First of all, you're right, it would have been about 8.5% sort of growth in EBITDA for the first quarter over last year, absent the impact of Oklahoma and the newly acquired assets. So that is correct, about 310 basis points drag on EBITDA growth from those. Obviously, we've got OU in our model for the rest of the year, and we do expect the acquisition drag that we have here in the first quarter to show improvement as we go throughout the rest of the year.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. And this is Bill. Obviously, I'd add on to it, we have management plans being implemented, and we fully anticipate improved performance for the balance of the year. We believe in our Houston acquisitions, we'll be materially close to what our run rate is by the end of the year. As we integrate Memorial Savannah, I think that's a little bit longer ramp for us going throughout. We have confidence that we continue to hit kind of our overall expectations. We can offset any shortfall from our acquisitions due to the continued performance in the core business. And again, I think we remain confident at least in the long-term contribution of these acquisitions for the company.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you. Just time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question will come from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Wait a minute, Gary, I don't think so. We just ran out of time. Just kidding. Go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I figured. I was a little surprised myself. I appreciate it. Actually, I just wanted to clarify a little something Ralph was touching on, maybe with just a touch more. I just want to make sure, it looked like Memorial closed about a couple days after you'd given previous guidance. I wasn't sure if that was in the prior guidance before or not. And then on this some-$30-million-odd of acquisition drag, you're saying it gets better through the year, which makes sense. Is it actually a little bit bigger drag in the 2Q because you have the full quarter of Memorial? And then finally, when do you think that net acquisition drag becomes a neutral number? Do we get into first quarter of 2019 before we escape that drag?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Hey, Gary. This is Bill. Let me \u2013 first of all, Savannah was not in our original guidance going through, you're correct. We closed on February 1, so it was not part of the original guidance going forward. Relative to Q2 and Q1, Q1 we are burdened with some transactional costs in that number. That won't reoccur in Q2, and we anticipate continued improvement, I think, throughout the year. And so, we'll have to wait and see what the Q2 performance looks like, but I think internally, we're expecting continued performance improvement. In terms of when they get to net neutral, I think we hope by the end of the year, we're on that kind of run rate.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Victor L.

The third quarter results were generally comparable to our performance in the first six months of the year, the results were driven by strong revenue growth and good expense management.","Revenue increased more than $1.2 billion or 11% in the quarter, this increase was driven by combination of the strongest same facilities growth in volume, we have seen in over the past 17 quarters and the revenue from our recent acquisitions.","On a same facilities basis, revenue grew by approximately $700 million or 6.3%. We had broad based volume growth across most service categories and it was balanced across our markets with growth in 13 or 14 domestic divisions.","On a same facilities basis, in patient admissions grew 3.2%, we have now grown our same facilities in patient admissions in 22 consecutive quarters. Equivalent admissions grew 4.2%, emergency room visits grew by 4.1%, in patient surgeries grew 2.2% and outpatient surgeries grew by 2.6%.","The growth in revenue converted into solid earnings in the quarter with diluted earnings per share of $2.23 which excludes gains on sales of facilities and the losses on retirement of debt. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9% to approximately $2.3 billion, the strategic investments we are making in our business to expand our networks and improve our clinical capabilities are creating greater accessibility for patients to receive high quality convenient patient care in an HCA Healthcare facility.","The most recently available in patient market share data again showed good growth for the company.

As Sam mentioned, virtually all of our operating statistics for the quarter were solid and I will provide some additional information.","During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions increased 3.1% and equivalent admissions increased 4.5%. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same-facility medicate admissions increased 4.5% and equivalent admissions increased 4.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year.","Our same-facility managed care admission increased 3.4% and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 2.1% and equivalent admissions increased 3.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year.","Same-facility emergency room visits increased 4.1% in the quarter, our level 1 to 3 visits increased 2%, while our higher acuity level 4 and 5 visits increased 5.8% over the prior year. In addition, admissions to the emergency room increased 3.4% over the prior year. Same-facility net revenue per equivalent admission for a domestic operation grew 2.2% over the prior year in the quarter and year-to-date is growing 2.7% in line with our guidance range for the year.","Same-facility in patient surgeries grew 2.2% and our outpatient surgeries grew 2.6% in the quarter over the prior year.","Now, let me move on to operating expenses. We had another solid quarter of expense management. Our same-store margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter and our same-facility operating expenses per equivalent admissions grew 1.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year.","Our same-facility labor cost per adjusted admission grew 1.9% in the quarter, same-facility average hourly rate grew 2.7 in the quarter versus the prior year and we continue to see labor productivity improvements.","Same-facility supply cost per equivalent admission grew 0.9% over the prior year period. Same-facility other operating expenses per adjusted admission increased 0.7% compared to the prior year.","During the third quarter, the company recognized a favorable professional liability reserve adjustment of 50 million based on our updated actuarial assessment. This compares to the 70 million favorable adjustment recognized in last year's third quarter. Also, during the quarter, the company recorded an additional 30 million share based compensation expense.","Our recent acquisitions also had another solid quarter outperforming our expectations. The acquisitions had an approximately 80 basis points unfavorable impact on consolidated margins in the quarter.","So, let me take a moment to talk about cash flow. Cash flow from operations continues to be strong. Cash flow from operations totaled 2.13 billion versus 1.72 billion in the third quarter of last year. Capital spending for the quarter was 1.14 billion in line with our expectations.","During the quarter, we redeemed 4.95 billion aggregate principle amount of senior secured notes. Pre-tax losses on retirement of debt totaling 211 million for these redemptions were recorded during the quarter.","During the quarter, we paid 239 million to repurchase 1.846 million shares and we have 1.5 billion of repurchase authorization remaining as of September 30, 2019. Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share.","At the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 billion available on our revolving credit facilities and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.56x. Earnings per shares including gains on sales of facilities on losses on retirement of debt was $2.23 in the third quarter of this year versus $2.16 in the third quarter of last year.","The adjustment to the professional liability reserve accounted for $0.11 of EPS this year versus $0.15 last year. Share based compensation expense equated to $0.23 this year and $0.15 last year. And we also recorded $0.08 of EPS in 2018 due to some hurricane tax credits.","And finally, the excess tax benefit per share based compensation was $0.01 this year versus $0.07 last year.","As noted in our release, we updated our full year 2019 guidance with projected adjusted EBITDA to range between 9.65 billion and 9.85 billion. And projected earnings per share ranged between $10.30 to $10.65 and we anticipate capital spending to approximate 3.8 billion.","So, that concludes my remarks and let me turn the call back over to Sam.","Sam Hazen","Before we go to questions, I want to give you some preliminary thoughts around 2020. It's always difficult to predict with certainty, the various components of our business. We believe the overall fundamentals in our markets and primary drivers of growth remain strong. We also believe, we are well positioned to capitalize on this favorable environment as we continue to execute our operational initiatives, improve the competitive positioning of our networks with capital spending and integrate our acquired hospitals.","As a result, in 2020, subject to our usual assumptions, we believe core operation should grow organically near the mid to upper part of our long-term growth expectations and we believe the acquisitions we have completed should push our growth rate slightly above the top of our long-term growth expectations. We will be wrapping up our budgeting process over the next few months and we look forward to sharing our detailed guidance with you in January.","Now, let me turn the call over to Mark for questions.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thank you, Sam. Anna, you might now give instructions to those who like to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And will now take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question.","Just I guess want to jump off of Sam's comments there. So, core growth toward the high-end, I want to just verify that the core growth target is roughly 4% to 6%. And I think this year, you are talking about acquisitions contributing to that, I'm pretty sure you guys have been saying that the acquisition have been contributing about 3% to 4% to growth, I'm assuming that would moderate next year. But, can you just comment on the trajectory of how those bigger acquisitions will continue to contribute as we look at the next year to grow because I assume there'll be incremental permission in Savannah for a couple of years.","Sam Hazen","Thanks A.J. Bill?","Bill Rutherford","Hey A.J. This is Bill. Let me take this. Yes. Let me confirm, we said some time our long-term adjusted EBITDA growth range is between 4% to 6%. We think we have a pretty solid track record of performing within that range and at least recently we've been at the mid to high-end of that range. We're also in a period where acquisitions been contributing to our growth profile. As you mentioned, we anticipated 3% to 4% this year. We expect them to continue to the growth of the company. But as you alluded to likely not at the same rate as this year as we had first year permission and continue to turnaround some of the performance for few others.","So I think as Sam mentioned, we haven't completed our budget process, but our commentary was trying to give you some direction on where we see operating with our long-term range. We'll provide obviously a lot more detail and specifics on our year-end call. But I think with a solid performance of the company this year we want to provide a little -- some general comments related to early thoughts for 2020.","A.J. Rice","All right.","Sam Hazen","A.J. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with UBS.","Whit Mayo","Hey thanks. Bill, you've got the final 2020 in patient rates and dish -- Medicare dish set. We've got the pending outpatient rule. Just sort of curious how the improved pricing environment is sort of shaping your views as you comment on growth at the high-end of your long-term guide, any help around just how internally you guys are thinking about Medicare rates next year would be helpful.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. This is Bill. So, we are anticipating variable Medicare rate update again this year pretty comparable to what we're seeing this year likely in a 2.5% to 3% rate update. So, we factor that in not only to our guidance, and will continue to factor into our 2020. But we do see it being a generally favorable environment relative to the combined Medicare pricing force next year.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Thanks.","Sam Hazen","Thanks Whit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question around sort of the CapEx and sort of impact that you guys are getting, it feels like we're kind of in years three of this recent acceleration in CapEx obviously this year are going to be running even higher than you have in recent years. And I know you've spoken in the past about sort of that 15% to 16% return on CapEx. So, I'm curious is that one of the drivers of sort of this improved growth rate that we're seeing in recent years and is there a way to kind of line up growth in specific markets where you've really put some serious dollars in terms of projects and how you guys track it. So, just sort of generally around the CapEx and how that's working?","Sam Hazen","This is Sam. I think capital expenditures and our capital spending plan that's geared toward increasing capacity, adding clinical technology for our physicians, and really building out our ambulatory network is clearly a key component of our growth agenda. It's difficult to pinpoint specifically the value of that in the total performance of the company. Clearly, we can look at an individual hospital and score whether or not we achieved our expectations on our capital.","But, keep in mind a lot of our capital is for long run purposes. It's not just for a short run. And so some of our projects because of the complexity of building the project, it's really geared toward a much longer run. So it takes us a while to get a full payoff on that. And so, we monitor our performance against our expectations. Generally speaking, we have outperformed our modeled financial returns on most of our projects. We've had a few obviously that we don't accomplish what we had hoped. But, when you sort of aggregate all that we believe it's contributing to the performance of the company and putting the company globally in a much better competitive position.","We are running the company today at occupancy levels of approximately 73% on the inpatient and that's in spite of a lot of capital that's hit this year. I think over the course of this year we're adding more beds than we did in the previous year. And I think in 2020, we're anticipating a similar amount coming online as we had in 2019. So, it's hard for me to point to just that. I mean have a robust physician relationship agenda that's adding value as we continue to add physicians to our network.","I think our clinical excellence agenda is yielding value as we continue to improve our quality performance. And then ultimately our outpatient network continues to grow. We will be up to roughly 145 ambulatory surgery centers over 100 freestanding emergency rooms almost 150 urgent care centers and roughly 1300 physician clinics that are connected to our 185 hospitals and all of that is connected to I think the overall volume performance of the company.","Bill alluded to this. We had the broadest based volume performance as far as positive metrics that I've seen in almost three years. The only two areas that were flat were behavioral health was flat from an admissions standpoint and our outpatient surgery centers were modestly up. Our hospital based outpatient surgeries was very strong and that's what drove our overall outpatient volumes. So, we had really broad based comprehensive volume growth that I think speaks to the overall growth agenda that the company has had for years. And we think is appropriate as we look forward.","Josh Raskin","Perfect. Thanks.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks Josh.","Operator","Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Good morning guys. Nice quarter. Just a follow-up actually on that topic of inpatient and outpatient surgeries. Third quarter was quite strong versus sort of the first half of the year, strong and sort of very challenging comps. And so I guess could you talk a bit more about what caused the strength of both inpatient, outpatient which was it expansion [indiscernible], expansion of ORs, hiring docs or what led to that strengthen and gives conviction around that continuing over the next year and a half.","Sam Hazen","Well, Pito. This is Sam. That's obviously a solid question for us given some of the trends. And we indicated that we expected our procedure volume in the third quarter to be a little bit stronger because we did have a slight calendar tailwind. And when you score that tailwind it did contribute some modestly we think to the overall performance. But I think our surgical growth initiative has been one that we've spoken to over the past number of years as we continue to improve our operating room processes as we continue to respond to what our physicians need. And then, as we continue to invest in technology within our surgical suite. Robotics is an example of that adding deeper capabilities in cardiovascular care and so forth is driving surgical performance for the company.","Our cardiovascular surgery on the inpatient was very strong almost 7.5% up. Our orthopedic volume in total, our total joints were up 7%. We had strong robotics performance. Our vascular surgery was performance. So, some of this is clearly supply and that we're adding more Ors, but it's also our physician strategy. It's our program strategy. It's our performance improvement strategy, our clinical initiatives. All of this is really sort of the foundation as I mentioned previously for us as we think about our growth prospects. And we detail our surgical performance very carefully. We detail our physicians in the marketplace very carefully, so we understand what their needs are and then we monitor best performances and best practices across the company to share those broadly. And we think that's a very successful formula and one that's yielding success not just in this quarter but over time. And we believe it will continue to pay dividends for the company as we move into the future.","Mark Kimbrough","Right. Thanks Pito.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. I think I'll settle on this one. Could you give us a little update on how you're approaching physician recruiting, physician employment, acquisition of physicians or seems to be sort of a renewed pace of activity private equity, others making acquisitions are rolling up some of the physician space and just wanted to see if your strategy is going to have to change to any degree in terms of outright employment and acquisitions.","Sam Hazen","I don't see a change. This is Sam again. Gary, thank you. I don't see a change in our strategy per se. We have been about recruiting we have been about employment. We have been about other methods of alignment with a clinical relationship and leadership and program development and those continue to yield success for us. We are growing our medical staffs at about 1.5% to 2% per year. It's coming through all of those channels, I just spoke to. We believe that across the company's portfolio of facilities that are physician development initiatives are gaining momentum in the face of some of these issues that you alluded to. And it's because folks are seeing the investments that we're making, the improvements in overall quality and nursing that we're making. And it's attracting physicians.","We have 45,000 physicians who practice at HCA facilities. We employ about 7,000 of those. We are growing our employment ranks at probably 8% to 12% per year. So, it is a more common tactic within our physician ranks, but it's not a sole strategy for us as we look to the future.","Gary Taylor","Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the commentary on 2020 guys. A question here on the balance sheet. Came out of the -- it looks like you're going to come out of the year, I should say with debt to EBITDA at low end of your range at about 3.5%. If I kind of just do some math on the implied guide, you'd be at more like 3.25%. So yes, I know your long-term target is 3.5% to 4.5%. It looks like you'd have $7 billion, $8 billion of room just to get back to the mid point. So, just curious as to how you're thinking about that opportunity kind of going into 2020, would think the M&A pipeline share repurchase opportunity, et cetera. Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Justin, thanks for the question. This is Bill. You're right, our leverage ratios at the low end of our range and we are obviously very pleased with that. We think this continues to give the company a lot of flexibility and optionality into the future. As far as the longer term range. Obviously, some will give a lot of thought to and we'll continue to evaluate it. Not making any changes to our range at this time, but as you know, we're going into our planning cycle. We continue to evaluate our capital policies. We do have a couple of smaller acquisitions that hopefully we'll close towards the end of the year. We'll likely fund through that. We've stated for some time we think the strength of our cash flow and physician, the balance sheet is obviously an important attribute for the company. We think we've got a pretty balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation from our capital investments to share repurchase to dividends as well as managing the balance sheet.","So, again, I think we're very pleased with the result. I think the level where we are right now continues to give us a lot of flexibility as we continue to see potentially high value acquisitions come into the fold. We've got the capability to execute on those.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks Justin.","Justin Lake","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. I just want to follow up. I guess Q2 was a little bit surprising to people and it seemed like it was -- I guess you guys called it a revenue issue and I guess in particular kind of commercial volumes being weak. This quarter looks better, but I wonder if you could maybe say it's still kind of towards the lower end of your long-term view on pricing. So, just want to see where we are on that and if there's any post-mortem on what happened in Q2 and why it seems to be getting better now.","Sam Hazen","Bill.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Kevin, thanks. This is Bill. So yes, Q2 was a little soft. We attributed some case mix, some isolated issues and a few markets. We were pleased to see it bounce back up. Obviously, we had very good payer mix with the commercial volume growth. Year-to-date as we mentioned, we're at that 2.7, 2.5 range if you will, which is right in the midpoint of our range. So again, I think with our visibility and our contracts, we will continue to have great visibility into our commercial contracts. We continue, as Sam mentioned, invest in some of our higher acuity services that I think second quarter just post some softness for us and pleased with where we are in a year-to-date. And rebounded here in the third quarter as well.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.","Ann Hynes","Hi, good morning. I know you gave some color on the acquisitions, but I love some more color just on the margin profile. Late 2017, early 2018 you acquired 2 billion of revenue. Can you let us know what the merger and profile of those acquisitions are right now and mission as well? Thanks.","Sam Hazen","As a portfolio if you will, I'd say the margin of those acquisitions are running high single digit right now. And that's where we anticipated, we knew each of them have a little bit different story to them. We knew Memorial and Savannah would take us some time to recover, very pleased with the performance of where that stands. Mission, obviously, we're in the first year. So, I think I characterize the margin performance of those acquisitions is high single digit. The contributing to the growth this year as we've mentioned, we think they'll continue to contribute to growth next year and we knew those would be multi-year process for us. So that's how I would characterize the margins, high single digits right now.","Ann Hynes","Thanks.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.","Steve Tanal","Thanks guys. Good morning. I guess one quick question. Hey, Mark. Just the managed care adjusted admissions growth was really strong and compare a year ago looked particularly tough. So kind of just thinking through that, I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on the macro environment. Obviously, Medicaid adjusted admins are still growing a bit faster than commercial, but commercial's really solid and absolutes. And so how are you all thinking about payer mix? Are these dynamics pretty good? I mean, is that a headwind in your mind or any commentary there. And if you have the acuity mix number that would be great to the index. Thanks guys.","Sam Hazen","Well, I think the environment we still read is very positive. We continue to see solid economic indicators in our markets. Good employment numbers. We had anticipated commercial growth in that 1% to 2% range. We're running on a year-to-date basis. So, I think would characterize the overall market is still is favorable for us. We know in any one period they are subject to some trends here or there, very pleased with the commercial volume trends in the second quarter. But overall, when we look at the economic indicators, we look at the employment indicators, we're looking at our access to contracts. We still think that's a pretty good environment for the HCA.","Relative to intensity, our case mix was basically flat for the quarter. We think there are some factors that are contributing to that. We continue to see that our clinical improvement initiatives are paying dividends as we see reducing sepsis, reducing ventilator days for critical care patients, improving end of life. All of these clinical initiatives do have some impact on our case mix metrics, but obviously brings a lot of value to our patients. So, we think there's some -- probably a few other service line areas, but again, I think the revenue clearance that we had in the quarter was very strong and in line with our expectations.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Steve.","Operator","We will now take a question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. You referenced a couple of smaller acquisitions that you may wrap up before the end of the year in terms of capital deployment. I think I've seen some press accounts on some of those, but I'm more curious about the opportunity for larger systems like you did with Mission and with then Savannah. I'm just curious, are you seeing any change in the landscape there that might suggest some of those kinds of opportunities maybe more likely. Thanks.","Sam Hazen","I don't know that the landscape per se Frank, this is Sam. It's changing. I think we are having more discussions. I'll say with systems, whether or not any of those discussions materialize into a transaction that works for the seller or works for us is yet to be determined. We as Bill indicated, have a balance sheet that we think is positioned to absorb some decent size acquisitions. We think our organizational capability and chassis if you will, is built to take on more.","And so we're looking, we're talking, but we don't know if anything will necessarily surface as we go through the next few years. Obviously, the marketplace is generally good for most of the not-for-profits that are out there. And it will be a forward thinking board that makes a decision in my estimation to want to do a strategic decision or transaction with us and looks beyond sort of the short run.","So, what we have to see how those discussions go? We're excited about the acquisitions that we've done. As Bill indicated, we're seeing a progression in performance. We're accomplishing what we had anticipated internally with our modeling for the most part. And we still see opportunities for improvement in them. So, that gives us confidence that our capability in assimilating acquisitions in the organization are getting better. And so as opportunities present themselves we're hopeful that we'll be able to take advantage of those.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Frank.","Frank Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Sorry. Thanks. Good morning. So, certainly lots of strong operating trends this quarter. And this was touched on a little bit, but obviously the same-store revenue per adjusted admission improved slightly from last quarter. But didn't have quite the snapback in 3Q to the 3.5% to 4.5% trends that the company posted for about six quarters in a row before that metric softened up a little bit with the 2Q results.","So I guess, I'm just curious if there's any -- just additional color around potential improvements in the variables that are hidden there, I mean, you obviously touched on the commercial surgeries, but curious if there is anything else kind of hitting that a little bit. And do you see a glide path to that getting back to 4% near term just based on how things are progressing right now. Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Thanks. This is Bill. So, we've said we anticipate 2% to 3% in RAA. We've said our year-to-date performance is right in the middle of that. We are confident that we saw the improvement from the second quarter to third quarter. We look at our inpatient revenue per admission grew 4.2%, so really solid inpatient growth. And that coupled with our outpatient revenue growth.","I'll tell you, we really don't see any structural or major factors that influence that, or with the complexity of our revenue, there are a lot of variables that impact that between mix and service acuity and so forth. But, I think I characterize, we're pleased with where we are on a year-to-date performance. And again, I don't see any really major changes -- structural changes that should impact materially.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. All right. Appreciate the extra color. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take a question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Question just -- one of your peers that had reported that talked about being a bit more aggressive posture from some of the payers in 3Q in terms of denials on inpatient admits versus observation. Just wanting to see it doesn't look like it from some of the fundamentals that you recorded on commercial volumes and pricing, but they just want to see whether, have you seen any of that similar dynamic in any of your markets and recently or has that not been the case?","Bill Rutherford","This is bill. So, those are always factors that we deal with in the administration of health. We called out observation in the past and we see that kind of cycle around the country in terms of utilizing observation in patient status. Denials is a challenge for the industry that we spend a considerable amount of time and effort appealing and making the clinical case. And we have seen that activity increase. I don't characterize it as that a material driver for us. We've got strong operating indicators that we can overcome that. But, I think the industry continues to deal with patient status and observation as well as denials and the adjudication of claims that we spent a considerable amount of time, effort and resources and we think HCA is well positioned to advance our case when we do have those denials. But, it's a factor for us that we have to deal with.","Sam Hazen","Let me add to that Bill. I think we have efforts underway with a number of the major payers to take advantage of our technology, their technology, our size, their size to create a more friction free environment for our patients and not have sort of the confusion that that centers around some of the billing processes both for them and their members and for us and our patients. And I'm optimistic that some of these major payers are going to move toward a more technology friendly capability for both organizations that yield a better answer for the patient and the member. And so that's part of what we're attempting to do with our Parallon capabilities and integrate that appropriately into some of the claims shops that these big payers have. So that it's a much more efficient, low cost transaction environment for both organizations.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","We will now move to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.","Matt Borsch","Let me yet stick on theme that Scott was asking about, but a different -- slightly different area that which is, we've heard that one of the largest payers is instituting a rule where all hospital cited outpatient procedures are going to have to go through pre-certification of some sort. I'm curious if you're -- if that's something on your radar screen and whether you think that will have impact in the fourth quarter.","Sam Hazen","Well, this is Sam. I don't anticipate any fourth quarter impact from that particular policy that you're referencing. We have provisions inside of most of our contracts that speak to how the network will function, the network being our inpatient facilities or outpatient hospital facilities and our ambulatory facilities. And so typically speaking, we protect that network in a way that is appropriate for the payer and the patient and our physicians. And ultimately we have dealt with a lot of these policies and procedures in the past around site selection and so forth. And we'll continue to work with the payers on those to find the right location for the patient, so they get the clinical outcome they want. It's at the price point that's appropriate and we're not anticipating any significant change in sort of the composition of our business as a result of that.","Matt Borsch","Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","We'll now move to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. I was wondering for the quarter, can you talk a little bit about the share taking end market and how much of that is payer strategies, maybe changes in steerage networks and things like that as opposed to maybe physician directed with your owned or affiliated physicians and other sorts of strategies?","Sam Hazen","I think if you go back to the comments -- this is Sam that I made about our growth model and how we think about our growth model. That model has been consistent for us over the years and we find that it resonates in the marketplace with the patient. It resonates with the physician and it resonates with the payer. And so the combination of those components of our model we think is yielding the market share gains that we have sustained over time.","In our most recent information we gained market share in 22 or 25 service lines that we monitor and we gained share in 73% of our markets where we get information. So, the basic elements of our growth model, appropriately detailed, appropriately resourced and really well executed by our employees and our teams is yielding what we believe to be the value inside of this growth model. Again, it's value for our patients, we believe; it's value for our physicians; and ultimately we think it's value for the payers.","And so our approach, it's hard to sort of deconstruct one item to say that this item is what's driving it, because it varies a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances. But when we pull up an aggregate, the performance of the company aggregate the strategy of the company and start to point to it, we think it takes all components of sort of the HCA flywheel, if you will, to ultimately drive this kind of consistent growth that we've been able to sustain for extended periods of time.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Lance.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah James","Thank you. Volumes were pretty strong across the board and the quarter. Did that put any pressure on using temporary staff? Where do you guys sit now on temp staff usage and how impactful is that on your expense load? Then more broadly on expense control, last quarter you mentioned ongoing efforts for supply chain and I T savings revenue cycle management. How are you thinking about how much further you can push these initiatives? How much savings is left to be achieved? Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Thanks Sarah. Yes, Sarah. This is Bill. So, we continue to be pleased with the operating cost performance of the company. Obviously, when we get good volume we can leverage some of our fixed cost structure and pleased with the performance. We have, as you probably know, initiatives throughout all aspects of the company from continuing to manage labor costs to supply cost improvements to other operating and I think that yielded and showed itself in the third quarter.","So, we're very pleased with the performance, very proud of our teams in terms of what they do to manage the cost structure of the company. Regarding temporary labor, that was an area we call it out that we saw some really good improvement over the past, call it, year to year and a half as our operators reduced our turnover and we reduced our contract labor. Tell you that's pretty stabilized on us right now year-to-date. Pleased, when we do have volume peaks, we sometimes have to use that temporary labor, but we manage it within the whole context of the labor line.","So again, I think for the quarter we're pleased with where we stand and year-to-date we continue to manage that 2% to 3% range. That's a solid number for us.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Sarah.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now move to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa","Good morning, nice quarter. Looks like in Washington a lot of the healthcare issues are being sort of kicked into early next year. Things like surprise billing and dish. Are these delays going to hurt you guys in any way or do you think it gives you just more time to repair? And is there any one of those that we should focus on more than some of the others in terms of something that could have more of an impact given the delays?","Sam Hazen","Well, I think this is Sam again. I think, obviously, there are a lot of discussions going on in Washington about healthcare within the democratic primary and then within the legislative process currently within the Washington DC area. And even in some states we're seeing some healthcare policy discussions that we're having to engage in. Obviously, we said this before, we are supportive of legislation that protects the patient, whether that's protecting the patient from a surprise bill as defined or a in making sure that the patient has the transparency around their out of pocket costs. So, we're supportive of those elements. I think moving beyond those elements, we do have concerns and we don't believe that they're going to accomplish more than what they need to accomplish around the patient.","So those two pieces of legislation, the surprise billing and the transparency, again, as it relates to the patient being protected and getting the necessary information, we're supportive neither of those present any unusual challenges for us. As we think about the future it's just that we think if they overreach, if you will in some of those areas, it could create some challenges here or there.","As it relates to the dish, I think we're still waiting for the final outcome on that, but we don't anticipate that having a very significant impact on our Medicare revenues as we move into the 2020.","Peter Costa","Thanks.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks Pete. Diana, we are going to take three more and then, we are going to close it off.","Operator","Okay. Perfect. Thank you, sir. We'll now take a question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just really quick and simple question for me. So, as I think about the qualitative comments you made about what the 2020 outlook, how should we be thinking about your views on margin expansion? I'm factoring in obviously the improvement in the acquired hospitals from 2017. And then what percentage or is there M&A baked into that expectation as well, incremental over what's already been announced? Thanks.","Sam Hazen","This is Sam. Obviously, if we grow our volumes and we can keep our revenue on the high side of our guidance, we said this before towards the 5% to 6% on revenue growth, which is what we've generally had over the past six or seven quarters. We believe we should be able to increase our same stores operating margin with that kind of revenue growth, whether it comes in volume or in unit price combination. We think that's high enough to where we should be able to grow our operating margin all things being equal. As it relates to the low end of the range, our belief is that we should be able to maintain margins thereabouts with respect to our same stores portfolio.","As Bill spoke to a minute ago, our models for all of our acquisitions have a steady improvement in margins over time. These are large institutions. They have a lot of people connected to them and we have to be appropriate in how we adjust them to a more efficient environment. And as we make those adjustments, we do anticipate margin improvements as to how that affects the company's overall performance. I don't think it will color the margins of the company as much as the same store's performance, but our belief is that if we can grow our revenue in the upper side of our range, we should be able to incrementally generate a margin improvement.","I think in this quarter, our revenue clearance to EBITDA was roughly a 1.5x our average margin. And that's a good metric for us. And so that's at 6.3% same stores revenue growth, we were able to clear that revenue at about a 1.5x our average margin heading into the quarter. So that's a pretty good sort of microcosm of how we think about it. There are puts and takes to that and they have to be considered from one quarter to the next, but over time that would be our approach and our thinking.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","We'll now move to Matthew Gilmore with Baird.","Matthew Gilmore","Hey, thanks for the question. The self pay volume growth seemed pretty moderate this quarter even with a stronger ER visit number, I mean you could get some color on what drove that lower growth and self-pay was that just normal fluctuation quarter-to-quarter or anything new to call out that's helping to moderate that?","Sam Hazen","Well, we've been pleased with that performance, say the one thing I would call out is Virginia expanded Medicaid this year. So that's impacting some of that as we see conversions from self pay into Medicaid. So that's having a positive impact on that self-pay trend. Even if we normalize for that, I tell you it's still within what our expectations are within this, mid to higher single digit growth even outside the Virginia Medicaid expansion.","Matthew Gilmore","Got it. Thanks very much.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Take care.","Operator","Yes, sir. That will be from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom","Hey, good morning. Pretty wide range in your 4Q guide. Do you think we'll continue to see more seasonality for elective procedures into 4Q and if so, how did you factor that into your implied guidance?","Bill Rutherford","Yes, John. This is Bill. As I look at our guidance, our full year numbers pretty much in line with what we're running generally close to that 9% on a consolidated basis. Once you adjust for a few things, do remind everyone in fourth quarter of last year was a really strong quarter for us as well. As terms of seasonality, there always tends to be a little bit, I'll tell you right now, that hasn't been a major factor in our thinking. We've seen that level out over the past several years.","So, we've just continued to look at the progression of the quarters throughout the year and our fourth quarter guidance is with that. Obviously, we've been changing and improving our guidance each quarter as we've gone through the year where we stand right now, it looks to be pretty much consistent with what our year-to-date performances. So, that's where we stand for a 2019.","John Ransom","And just kind of as a follow-up to that, I know Mark's just want to cut me off, but this is a really interesting question. The Mercer survey showed another 300 bps of high copay plan growth for fiscal '20. How are you guys thinking about, if at all your patient engagement and financing strategies just with this continued relentless growth in patient out of pocket?","Bill Rutherford","Yes. John, I think we handle that reasonably well. I'll tell you from our view, we haven't seen a change that dramatically from what we've seen over the past several years. We're very pleased with our revenue cycle and our Parallon teams to address that. But, fro our view, I don't know if I see it accelerating as much as some of those headlines. So it's just within the context of our total revenue clearance that we managed through.","Sam Hazen","And one thing, this is Sam, that Bill and his team have done is I think create industry leading patient protection policies to help the patient deal with some of the burdens that come with high deductible plans. And in many instances, the patients don't fully understand what they've signed up for. And then they hit the system and we have to work with them to understand -- explain to them their plans and so forth. But we've built I think, a very patient friendly protection policy that's probably one of the most comprehensive ones in the industry to ensure that our engagement and our understanding with our patients is fair to them in a way that helps them get through some of the challenges that exist with these policies.","John Ransom","Great. Thanks so much.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, John.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the presentation back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call. As always, I'm available if you have additional questions or clarifications that you would need, just feel free to give me a call. But anyway, thanks again.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference and we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"10869":["HCA Holdings, Inc.

At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Audrey, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would both like to welcome everyone on today's call and to those of you who are listening on our webcast. With me here this morning: Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectation. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and are included in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our full quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations.","We were extremely pleased with the results of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion and, for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record earnings quarter for HCA and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was a result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management.","We believe the company is well positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth.","To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for eight consecutive years, ER visit growth for nine consecutive years and surgical growth for seven consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016.","The consistent execution of our growth strategy and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well-balanced shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation.","For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated and returned cash to shareholders either in special dividends or by share repurchase in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year-end.","We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we've repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock.","In addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as Top Performers by the Joint Commission compared to approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's Top Performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions.","In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics, and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high quality, and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on programmatic development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.","I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing, and well managed expense growth, with little less contribution from Reform than the past two years. We transition into 2016 with momentum and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform, and 2016 guidance","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2016 guidance. Then, I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on operations. As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year.","Now, let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volume trends in a moment. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8% respectively. This included both traditional and managed Medicare.","Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8% respectively in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year.","Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6% and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year.","Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter.","Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior year period.","Now, turning to expenses, expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and a higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015.","Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter, compared to the prior-year period, and improved 80 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives.","Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter, compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations.","As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas waiver item in 2014 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period.","Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions, as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter, compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015.","When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full-year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter that finished a very strong year for the company.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared to the $1.627 billion last year, which is primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full-year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year, and free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities.","So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year, and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases.","Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. We expect a continued step-down of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipated growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%.","Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more suggestive and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes, which we can identify, the converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe Reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company and a reasonable estimate today is Reform will contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016.","Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our three-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45.","So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter we had broad-based growth across our divisions, and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics, but also, in any other areas of our business.","For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admissions by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits by almost 2%. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in adjusted admissions.","And within the division, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks and 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects.","In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same-facility basis, in-patient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter, and for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%.","Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital based and our freestanding ambulatory surgery center division showed solid growth. Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volumetric down for the quarter, it was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%.","Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is a result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs.","And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers coupled with 3.3% growth in the number of physicians, who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts.","As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well-positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our markets is strong. We estimated that approximately 2% per year driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenues in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years.","Market share is at an all-time high and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next two years, we will add close to 1,000 in-patient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraints and growth opportunities. The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary end-market acquisitions are available, especially, in the outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016.","In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and a right approach to the market for sustaining growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, guys. And, Audrey, if you come back on and pole for questions. And we would like to keep questions to one at a time, so everyone gets a chance.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go first to A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. So I'm just thinking about the EBITDA growth target for 2016. You've got a 3% to 7% at the high- and low-end of the range or low- and high-end of the range. And I think Bill made the comment that 1% of that is probably attributable to incremental Reform benefit. And you also mentioned high-tech and stock-based comp. I guess, they're about a $40 million each headwind. So they're about 1%. They sort of eat up that Reform benefit. So the 3% to 7%, is it right to think about that going forward as sort of the parameters around your organic growth? Can you give us some flavor for how you think about that?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","A.J., thank you very much. Milt, do you want to take that?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. So, A.J., as you know, back in 2011 shortly after the IPO, we started giving long-term growth expectations for HCA again based on the conditions of the market, economic conditions, and the like. And we pegged that at about 3% to 5%. And so as we look now at the markets, the improvement in economic conditions and the like, we feel a little bit better about our growth prospects. Obviously, we've had a good run here, especially, over the past two years really over the last five years, but especially, over the past two years. And I feel like now we're more maybe in the 4% to 6% outlook.","But, again, I caution to give long-term outlook and our industry right now with, again, some of the changes in developments, but we see it a little bit more favorably than we did, say, four years ago. And so, obviously, this year we feel good about our guidance in that 3% to 7% range. But on a long-term basis, I'd probably peg it now at 4% to 6%.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thanks, A.J.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll move next to Andrew Schenker at Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to discuss a little bit more about the utilization trends. I mean, you obviously gave quite a bit of color about the economy, et cetera, but, I mean, even as 2015 progressed on kind of a two-year stack, you continue to see acceleration throughout the year, and your guidance remains quite strong for next year, especially, given the continued tough flu comp in 1Q. Maybe just really, talk about what you are doing to drive this increased and strong volume trends and really how we should think about the long-term sustainability of these positive volumes.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Andy, thank you. Sam's going to address that.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","I think when you think about HCA's growth strategy, and we've spoken to this numerous times, we think, first and foremost, we have incredible markets where we do business. And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis, across the company approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth, as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth.","On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 basis points to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimate, and then roughly 25 basis points to 30 basis points of market share gains.","Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians. And that involves four, five major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively. We monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around, do we have the right network of outpatient facilities and ease of access, if you will, in the HCA's facilities, building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments, and then, working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network. And that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets.","And then, finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go-to-market-quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions, and globally, allows us to grow our business.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, thank you. Thank you, Andy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick at Mizuho Securities USA.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you. Listen, this is a very different tone, and congratulations on achieving a record year, or record quarter. Hard work, well-rewarded. I'm going to go back, though, and ask about the cost trends here, because this is such a substantial change from our last call. Can you talk about some of the things, I guess, that would be most probably a question for Sam that you've done to address the labor issues? Obviously, you're constantly monitoring them, but what's changed? What's improved? And should we now no longer be worried about nurse wage inflation and your ability to manage that cost going forward? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sheryl, thanks. And, Sam, gets that one again.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Okay. If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced from the third quarter to fourth quarter \u2013 that's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill \u2013 but that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year, and I'll speak to sequential in a moment, because I think the sequential performance is most important here, but year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it's slower than what it had grown in the previous nine months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics.","But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter by 1.7%. Now in the previous two years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in one year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity.","Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by (32:28) 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit, but, nonetheless, an opportunity.","As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied, 80% of the last 20 weeks we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our One HR (33:22) program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there.","So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration, but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Bill...","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Quick follow-on. I mean, in last quarter and the third quarter, we called out nursing turnover rates, again, the cause and effect of the contract labor increases. And we haven't solved the turnover issue in a quarter. We said that last quarter. And I really see that as an opportunity for the company in 2016 to improve that. And we have several initiatives that we will kick off to try to improve turnover in nursing, and in response, we should see a corresponding improvement in contract labor costs going forward as well. So, again, just to make it clear, we haven't solved the turnover issue. We're working on it. I expect to see improvement throughout 2016, and again, view it as an opportunity for the company.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, thank you. Thank you, Sheryl.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll move next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess, last quarter you mentioned, I guess \u2013 a little bit about payer mix and what you saw in Q4 versus what you saw in Q3. I guess, last quarter specifically you mentioned Medicaid authorization slowing down in Texas and Kansas. Did that come through and help the quarter, or is that still a drag? And what's your assumption about payer mix going into 2016?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Yes. All right, Kevin. Thank you. Bill's going to take that.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Kevin. This is Bill. I'll start and give you some color on our uninsured, and maybe Sam wants to add into this. So you're right. Our uninsured admissions we called out in the third quarter. If you recall, we saw over a 13% growth in uninsured admissions in the third quarter. That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8.9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons, mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions.","We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there, didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference to that, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represents roughly 2,800 admissions. And in the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there.","Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of as in any change catalyst such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single-digits. And that's what we have baked into our guidance going forward. Sam, any other mix comments?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","That's good. Kevin, thank you. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. Just a question, in your guidance, have you made any assumptions for benefit from the Louisiana Medicaid expansion?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's so immaterial in the overall scheme of things. We have \u2013 I'm counting up the facilities right now, we have four facilities in Louisiana, and they are not really material with respect to the company's overall position. So it doesn't have any significant impact at all on HCA. Obviously, it will benefit our Louisiana hospital, but it's not going to be material.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Fidel at Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I had a question just about the rising case mix, and maybe if you can give some more details on what you think the drivers of that are. And just interested if you're seeing that case mix being moved higher by the exchange volumes or if there's other factors that are driving that?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam, you want to take that?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. The short answer on the exchange volume is no. It's not big enough in the overall scheme of our volume to drive the company's composite case mix. With respect to case mix, again, I'll refer you back to my comments. I mean, the company is very intentional about trying to drive more complex, high acuity-type services to our facilities. Our strategy, our core strategy within our individual markets is to be able to offer somewhere in the HCA system all services to a patient.","So, for example, if we need a transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kinds of things. So over the last four years, five years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider systems. This past year, we opened up three new burn centers, as an example.","We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 programs TAVR programs, which is very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery. So those kind of developments are ongoing within the company as part of our core strategy to be able to provide all services, a comprehensive array of services, to our system and to any patient that hits the HCA network.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And just a little bit more on that. I mean, what Sam described, these services be it burns or trauma, typically, lead to more surgical procedures in the facility. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've reported seven consecutive quarters of surgical growth. And so as we grow our surgeries, obviously, we're growing our case mix. And that's showing up in our numbers.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","We'll go next to Whit Mayo at Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Just curious, are you guys expecting any changes with Texas UPL, Florida LIVE (39:59), just any supplemental payment changes for 2016 that we need to be aware of?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Whit. Bill will take that.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Whit. This is Bill. Right now, no, our Texas waiver program and our guidance anticipates, and we're optimistic that the State and CMS will yield some continuation of the program in the fourth quarter. And so we're not anticipating now material changes to that going forward, nor are we in Florida LIVE (40:27) program right now as well. So our 2016 guidance for at least the revenue side is fairly consistent with what our 2015 results are.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thanks, Whit.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to Sarah James at Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Guidance looks like it implies about 4.6% to 7% growth in revenue versus the 3% to 7% EBITDA that you talked about. Or if I look at the range of revenue in adjusted EBITDA guidance, it looks like at the low-end, it was accounting for up to 30 basis points of the decline. So is that just conservatism? And if not, could you walk us through some of the moving pieces that you see going on there?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","For Bill, either...","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, I'll try to cover it, and you can add in. I think I get the gist. You're looking at the low-end of our guidance. As Milton said in our comments earlier, the midpoint of our guidance represent on as reported about a 5% growth over our 2015 levels. When you adjust for the high-tech and share-based comp, the midpoint is roughly 6%, which is one of the higher levels that we've guided going forward. Yeah, on the low-end that would change it from 3% to 4%, but it gets us in that range of kind of 4% to 6% when you factor those items. Again, Milton mentioned in his comments in response to an earlier question. So I think it from a guidance perspective compared to historically where we've guided, we feel very comfortable with where we stand right now.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. So on the core business with everything that you're doing with expense control for contract labor and drug costs, you see at least a maintenance of margins if not an improvement?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think that's correct. That's what we're looking for. And as we said, when we get on the high-end of that range, we expect some margin expansion, and in the middle point, it's in margin maintenance mode.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Sarah. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the cost lines. Again, SWB certainly improved, but looks like a really strong performance on supplies with it down on an adjusted admission basis. You talked about sort of higher acuity and good surgery numbers, so can you maybe talk about the improvements there, and I guess, the sustainability of that into 2016? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think it's important to understand that last year in the fourth quarter our supply costs were uniquely high and actually increased quite a bit more than we had anticipated. I don't remember all the specific reasons when I was looking at the metrics, though, we did jump up sequentially from the third to fourth quarter quite significantly. And in 2013, we also jumped up, but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year.","So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation as Bill mentioned in pharmaceutical costs. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan. So there's nothing really other than a difficult comp that I think speaks to supply expense.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Milt?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I just want to maybe talk about supplies a bit more longer term and some possible upside we have. HPG, our GPO, HealthTrust Purchasing Group, continues to grow. Tenet Healthcare will join HPG in February here in just a few days. And that should give us some opportunities with respect to further pricing improvement just off our base pricing through HPG contract.","So, on a long-term basis, I think, again, we also have upside just from how we're negotiating our contracts and pricing through the GPO, which, I think, will drive benefits not only for HCA, but really all of our members within HPG over the longer-term over next, say, 12 to 18 months.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Ralph","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Can you talk about your growth in urgent care and how it fits in with the inpatient strategy and if you're starting to see any oversaturation in any markets from urgent care?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","We have 66 urgent care centers inside of HCA, most of which have come in the form of acquisitions, the acquisition we did in Dallas and the recent acquisition that we did in Las Vegas. We have developed urgent care centers in Kansas City and Nashville and we have plans to expand our urgent care center platform to other markets and even within existing markets expanded.","There are a lot of urgent care centers inside of HCA markets, but with the acquisition of CareNow in particular, we think we acquired a best-in-class provider and our plan is to replicate that capability in other markets and roll out the model that they've used that is very, very effective for our patients and very, very effective for our network.","As it relates to our network, we do generate downstream referrals from our urgent care centers to both our physicians who are connected to HCA system as well as our emergency room and then on into the inpatient activity. The volume of downstream referrals is not nearly as large as our freestanding emergency room, which produce a larger downstream flow to our hospitals. But the components that we're trying to build here between physician clinics, urgent care centers, freestanding emergency room and then hospital-based emergency room is all part of having a system-wide approach to creating convenience, ease of access, user-friendly solutions for our patients, and then building out the geographical footprint of the HCA network.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Gary, thank you.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg at Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the trends in the bad debt expense. It's been volatile this year and the seasonal trend from Q3 to Q4, for the first time, that trend has gone \u2013 the bad debt's gone down sequentially since 2011. So I was hoping you could give us some color on what you're seeing there. And then more importantly, when we think about 2016, is sort of this $1.1 million-ish range per quarter the right level to think about? Thanks a lot.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks. As we have reminded people in the past, when you look at bad debts, we think you should look in terms of our total uncompensated care, which includes bad debt, charity and uninsured discounts, because, in any given quarter, you can have some fluctuations in there. And that's why we give the charity and uninsured discount numbers in my commentary. When you look at uncompensated care, anticipate that to grow as a percent of our gross revenue consistent with what our uninsured growth is.","In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter, and when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high-single digit uninsured volume growth there. So, you are subject to some fluctuations in the bad debt line alone as we adjust our uninsured discount percentage, and so you look at uncompensated care in total. But as we look at bad debts, I would think we'd continue to see that in play at our high-single digit uninsured volume growth.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Chris, thanks.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to John Ransom at Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I think your story is pretty straight forward. My question is, is there anything that would tempt you off your current path? You haven't really made a big acquisition in a while. Is there anything other than a big market coming up for sale that you're now thinking about? And then secondly, are there any plans, in my lifetime, to provide any more color on Parallon as a separate entity? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Hey, John, how long you're going to live here?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take this.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","I'll let Milt take this.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The Parallon first, we don't see Parallon as a separate entity. And actually when we formed Parallon, we really wanted it to be a subsidiary within HCA that we could grow. And we still have that objective and Parallon is growing. I mentioned HPG earlier, solid growth in HPG and I think we'll continue to see that as well.","With respect to your first question around acquisition opportunities, we have the financial flexibility, as you know, and access to capital to do more significant acquisitions. We're very disciplined in the sort of markets and facilities that we want to invest in. If it's just a matter of course of owning more hospitals, we could do that. But, again, they wouldn't fit our profile, wouldn't fit the long-term growth prospects and return prospects that we're looking for. So, we have been very disciplined in that and we will continue to be disciplined.","That being said, we pretty much at any point in time, we have a pipeline of meaningful opportunities. As I said...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, you never buy anything though, so.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I was going to say you heard me say many times over recent...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Your M&A guys have to be getting bored. They keep bringing the deals and you guys never buy anything.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Of course, we do a lot of in-market acquisitions. But as far as the big ones you're speaking to, things like say Kansas City that happened in 2003, those opportunities are really hard to find. They're going to come out of the not-for-profit sector. And typically, we may engage in conversation, but many times, these organizations decide ultimately not to sell.","So, we'll continue to be active and looking for the right opportunities. But, again, we're not building any of those into our expectations here in the short-term. But then again, if we find the right one, we're prepared to move on it. We've got the balance sheet and capability to do it. And we'll continue to be active in pursuing them, again, if the right markets present themselves.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Let me add one thing to Milton's comment about in-market acquisitions. Just over this past year, we acquired a physician network in San Jose, which significantly solidified our position strategy in a very important and growing market to HCA. We bought a large urgent care center inside of Las Vegas, which significantly improved our access and physician relationships and so forth in that market, which is a very important market to HCA. We bought a rural hospital that was contiguous to Orlando and Jacksonville. We were able to re-channel referrals out of that hospital into HCA's system, pick up incremental market share.","So, these complementary acquisitions, on top of that, I think we acquired five ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets. So these things are very, very strategic and create more durability, more competitiveness, and allow us to grow organically in very high growth markets. So, those are conservative from a capital allocation standpoint, predictable from a returns standpoint, and provide a lot of synergies to the organization. And so from that standpoint, those are very, very important. We don't call them out that often, but they're very, very important to those individual markets.","Victor L.

Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Matt, thank you. Bill, you want to get that?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Matt, thank you. Historically and pretty much consistent this year, about 30% of our bad debt is associated with kind of the deductible and copay and 70% coming from the uninsured population. When I look at kind of our deductible and copay and patient liability, really, what we've seen throughout 2015, we're seeing those kind of average balances grow in that 10% to 11% level, where maybe historically they were growing in that 7% to 8%. So, the average balances are growing a little bit. Our collections are holding \u2013 so our collections per account are holding with what are historical levels. So, it is slightly contributing to some increase in bad debt, but the majority of the bad debt's being driven by uninsured activity that we have.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks, Bill.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte at Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the question about the bad debt as it relates to the health insurance exchanges. The plans are \u2013 generally, the public plans are saying it's about 30% of their membership is special enrollments and, generally speaking, the special enrollment people are incurring, I think, 25% to 55% higher claims costs. And I was wondering, as you saw in the third quarter, the uptick in the bad debt, you talked about the Medicaid delays in processing, but a piece of it, I think, was exchange related.","And in the fourth quarter, as these guys probably saw the deductibles run through, do you have any idea of what their utilization patterns have been? And if they end up being delinquent between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if your claims adjudication has already been able to identify that, are you talking to \u2013 or are your claims systems on reimbursement communicating with the plans to make sure that's not happening?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Ana, thanks. Bill?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, first, put in perspective that our exchange volume is roughly 2% of the total company volume. So the exchange activity by itself is relatively small going forward on that. So, as we look at kind of the activity within the exchanges, we did mention in the third quarter we were seeing some previous exchange volume move to uninsured. It was 400 admissions for HCA in the third quarter. It was roughly the same in the fourth. That's on 460,000 admissions for the company.","So, yeah, there is some activity in that area. But for HCA, it's immaterial for us. And it's contained within the overall aspect of our bad debt trends that I've talked about previously.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill, thanks. We've got time just for a couple more quick ones here.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin at Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the CapEx numbers. I know you guys outlined the increase earlier this year and talking about $2.7 billion. So, just curious how much of that is maintenance CapEx? And then maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how much is being spent on traditional acute care hospitals versus outpatient centers and other things, or maybe just more color on those expenditures.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Josh. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","We spend about $250 million a year in IT-related expenditures. So I'm going to just lay that out there. Then, about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So, then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth.","As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and 2015 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity, inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs, or surgical capacity.","And so, it's very well diversified both in service line capability and also within our market. So, it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis, where we have physicians, we have fixed costs, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities.","So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals. They're more low startup hospitals that are very important to geographical presence and also to network development. But those don't add a lot of volume, but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill, did you want to add...","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'd just say with our increase in capital spend, and Sam and I, along with our group presidents are spending time out in the field within our hospitals. And from that we see opportunities, opportunities to invest, as Sam said, to expand services or to deal with capacity constraints that would otherwise exist. And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reason Sam just noted.","And just, I guess, to back up our performance, if you look back two years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%. And that's an incredibly \u2013 I think incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So, if we're investing more capital in our existing market, we're seeing a return growth. And so, again, we like the strategy. That's why we expanded it towards the \u2013 over the three years to $7.7 billion, up about $0.5 billion. And again, it gives us confidence with our guidance to see these opportunities in the fast-growing markets.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Josh.

So, I was wondering if you might just give us a little bit of an idea of how much more room is left to gain market share in your market or how much of an uptick you can get longer-term in market share? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, you want to close with that ne?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we're running 24.5% market share across all of HCA's market. So, I'd like to think we have 75 percentage points of upside. No, I'm being facetious there, Paula. We've been on a pattern of growing like I said between 25 basis points and 40 basis points a year. My thinking is for 2016 in particular and I think that's a reasonable target for us.","The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment, where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So, what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market.","And when we can deploy capital in a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across HCA's markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective. So from a market share standpoint, I think that's a pretty good metric for the company as far as the type of growth that we're thinking about, and I don't see any reason why that's not doable for the company in the near term.","Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Paula, thank you. We thank all of you and look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation."],"11015":["HCA Holdings, Inc.

Please note that today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Amelia, thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call, and those of you listening on the webcast. With us here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. excluding losses\/gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Morning, thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate your interest in HCA, and as you saw from our release this morning, our first quarter earnings results were consistent with the preview we issued on April 17. I'll make a few comments on the quarter and recent acquisition activity and then turn the call over to Bill and to Sam to provide more detail on the quarter.","Revenues for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $10.6 billion. Net income totaled $659 million or $1.74 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA was $2.005 billion. While these results were modestly below our internal expectations, we remain optimistic about 2017, and as you saw in our release, we are maintaining our previously issued earnings guidance for full year 2017. During the first quarter, we achieved or exceeded our internal growth expectations for adjusted EBITDA over prior year for January and March. However, it was largely offset by February's underperformance as planned.","Looking at volumes in the quarter, same-facility admissions increased 1.2% and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA. As we noticed in our preview, the quarter's results were impacted by unfavorable changes in payer mix and the loss of one day when compared to the first quarter of 2016. On the payer mix, our same-facility Medicare admissions comprised a larger percentage of the company's overall admissions at 48.1% compared to 47% last year, while our same-facility managed care and HIX admissions were 27.4% of admissions compared to 28.6% in the prior year's first quarter. Clearly, this had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue per adjusted admission in the quarter, and I'll let Bill and Sam address all of this in more detail in just a moment.","Cash flows from operations were strong once again for this quarter, totaling approximately $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion last year. The current quarter's cash flow was negatively impacted by a $188 million settlement payment in the quarter related to a longstanding contractual dispute in our Kansas City market. Adjusting for this payment, cash flows from operations were up approximately 4.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. We continue to see nice improvement in our working capital, with our days in AR now at 48 compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of last year and 52 days a year ago.","We continue to be quite active with our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.1 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $424 million. We have a little over $1.4 billion, I should say, remaining on our $2 billion authorization as of March 31, 2017, and we had 368.7 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2017. We now have repurchased approximately 37.5% of the outstanding shares at the time of our IPO six years ago.","Let me spend a moment on our recent acquisition activity. Yesterday, we announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire three Houston area hospitals from Tenet and two Texas hospitals from Community Health Systems, one in Tomball on the north side of Houston, and one in Jourdanton, which is about 40 miles south of San Antonio. These facilities will strategically complement these markets and will enhance our ability to meet the medical needs and improve patient access to our provider networks in both communities. We expect these transactions to close sometime in the summer of 2017.","In addition, we closed on a 231 \u2013 acute care hospital in Waycross, Georgia, that's also closed yesterday, which should complement our Jacksonville market. Also, last week, we announced the signing of a Letter of Intent to purchase Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia, a not-for-profit acute care hospital with 604 beds. Memorial Health is the only provider in the market of Level 3 PICU and NICU services and Level 1 trauma services. This should significantly strengthen our position along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville to Charleston. We expect this acquisition to close by year end. These four transactions are expected to add seven hospitals with over 2,000 beds and approximately $1.5 billion in new annualized revenues to the company. We look forward to bringing HCA's complementary (07:06) capabilities and operational scale to these facilities.","And I guess I would be remiss if I didn't say something this morning about all the national attention over the last three months to healthcare reform. While I'm not about to predict where all the repeal, replace and repair discussions will ultimately land, I want to assure you that we are actively engaged in discussions with policymakers in Washington and in our states. Most importantly, I'm confident HCA's long-term focus on putting the patient at the center of everything we do will serve us well no matter where these discussions may settle.","And lastly, the HCA Board of Directors last week approved a change in the legal name of HCA Holdings to HCA Healthcare. The change will be effective May 8. Our new name is more reflective of our mission and the broad spectrum of care we provide to our communities and the dedication of our caregivers to our patients in our vast network of inpatient and outpatient facilities across our 42 U.S. markets and the UK. HCA Healthcare will continue to trade under the symbol HCA.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning everyone. I will give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter.","As we reported in the first quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 1.2% over the prior year. Same-facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, and I will give you some trends by payer class.","During the first quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.5% and 4.3% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 7.3% on a same-facility basis and represent 34.1% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.9% and 1.3% respectively in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 3.2% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 3.5%. These represent 7% of our total admissions compared to 6.9% last year. Texas and Florida still represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions.","Managed care other and exchange admissions declined 3.2%, and equivalent admissions declined 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 18.7% of our total ER visits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 18.6% in the prior year.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 3% compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility surgeries were flat in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 0.9% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.5% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.7% in the quarter.","Our international division negatively impacted this stat in the quarter, mostly due to currency conversion.","Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations increased 2.3% over the prior year. Our same-facility managed care other and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% in the quarter, in line with expectations. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $510 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility charity care discounts totaled $1.086 billion in the quarter or an increase of $131 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.475 billion, or an increase of $379 million over the prior-year period. Overall, our uncompensated care trends are tracking in line with expectations and consistent with our uninsured growth trends.","Now turning to expenses, our same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.1% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues was 46.1% compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter. Our salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% in the quarter on a same-facility basis. Same-facility wage rates increased 2.3% in the quarter, and overall our labor trends remain stable.","Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.9% this quarter as compared to 16.7% in last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis. Our same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. We did see a slight increase in medical device spend due to volume growth of some high-acuity procedures. Other operating expenses increased 10 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.2% of revenues.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.28 billion, down slightly from the $1.399 billion in last year's first quarter. And as Milton mentioned, cash flow from operations was reduced by $188 million due to the Kansas City settlement that was paid in the first quarter. Cash from operations was benefited by continued strong performance in accounts receivable, with our AR days decreasing to 48 compared with 50 at December of 2016.","Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations less capital and non-controlling interest, was $564 million in the quarter compared to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.139 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.83 times at March 31, 2017 compared to 3.82 times at the end of 2016.","Let me mention briefly about healthcare reform. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 11,900 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 12,500 we saw in the first quarter of last year, or an approximately 5% decrease. You may recall we saw about 12,300 same-facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2016 for a 3.1% decline sequentially quarter to quarter. We saw approximately 49,800 same-facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximately 50,500 in the first quarter of 2016 and 43,900 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Overall, our exchange and reform activity is tracking with enrollment trends we see in our states, which is down about 5% from this time last year.","So that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the volume stats that I normally provide on these calls, and then I will give you an overview of our commercial volumes.","It is important to note that the prior year presented a difficult comparison in many areas. For the quarter, and for domestic operations on a same-facilities basis, 9 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, 10 divisions had Emergency Room visits growth, freestanding Emergency Room visits grew 16% and accounted for all of our overall ER growth, hospital-based Emergency Room visits were down 0.4%.","Normalized for the leap year effect, ER visit growth was approximately 2.2%. Inpatient surgeries grew 0.8%. Surgical admissions were 27% of total admissions in the quarter. Inpatient surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and neurosurgery categories. Nine divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down by 0.6%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.5%, and volumes declined by 0.7% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. Five divisions in the quarter had growth in outpatient surgery volumes.","Behavioral health admissions grew 0.5%. We had solid growth in approximately 85% of our 63 units, but we continue to struggle with a few of our larger units and they are driving most of this slow growth. We anticipate many of these programs will improve the performance over the course of the year. Rehab admissions grew 6.2% in the quarter. Deliveries were down 3.6% in the quarter, which drove a decline in neonatal admissions of 1.6%. Cardiology procedure volumes continued to be strong and grew over 5%. Trauma volumes grew 15% in the quarter.","Now let me transition to commercial volumes, which I'm defining as our managed care and HIX volumes. For the quarter, we believe there are two primary reasons for the softness in this segment of our business. First, we believe growth in overall commercial demand in our market has been slowing as compared to the strong growth we saw in 2014 through the first quarter of 2016.","The drivers of this issue, we believe, are as follows: one, the decline in HIX enrollment in our markets; two, the leap year effect; three, some notable general economy issues in a couple of our markets; and, finally, softer tourism traffic in two of our large Florida markets. We continue to believe demand for the commercial segment in HCA's markets will grow over the next few years and in an expected range of 1% to 1.5% per year.","The second reason for the softness in commercial volumes, we believe, is the impact of competitive pressures. The main drivers for this component are as follows: one, more supply across most patient care settings; two, HIX payer dynamics in certain Texas markets; and finally, a couple of competitors regained network status in certain payer contracts.","I want to add a few other observations which I think are noteworthy. First and importantly, outside of a few HIX contracts, which I mentioned, we have not experienced any network changes with payer contracts. That is, we have not lost any access to covered lives, nor do we believe there are any specific HCA steerage issues in our markets. And with respect to our contracting, we are 66% contracted for 2018, and 30% contracted for 2019, at pricing and network terms consistent with recent prior years.","The second observation I want to share is the broad based softness in commercial volumes that we saw in general across our markets. Five markets, however, accounted for almost 75% of our declines: south Florida, Houston, west Florida, Orlando, and Las Vegas. We did have a few markets that were up year over year.","And finally, commercial ER visits were basically flat when normalized for leap year. Higher acuity visits were up, but they were offset by declines in lower acuity visits. Obstetrics and general surgery volumes were down notably inside of our inpatient service lines. While commercial volumes have been a challenge over the past few quarters, we believe our efforts to build out our local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint are the right tactics. This effort, coupled with our service line, care coordination, and physician development initiatives, are necessary to compete effectively in this segment.","And finally, we believe our continued capital investments will create the necessary capacity and clinical capabilities in our facilities to continue attracting commercial patients.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Sam, thank you. Amelia, if you come back on, we'll take questions. Again, I'd encourage everyone to limit your questions to one so we can give everyone an opportunity.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, thank you. All right, and we will go first to Whit Mayo from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Maybe just can we first talk about the Houston transactions and maybe how you see the pieces of the puzzle coming together in that market, maybe how the assets strengthen and complement one another? Just kind of want to hear more about the playbook and opportunity that you see there.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you, Whit. Sam, you want that?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I do. We have 10 hospitals in Houston, Texas today. Our market share is roughly 18% or so, but most of our hospitals are in a region of the community where it's in the southeast and in the northeast. It's not in the northwest. Tenet's hospitals in Tomball are more in the northwest quadrant of the Houston metropolitan area, so this is a new market for us, effectively, in Houston. It adds roughly 4% market share to our 18% and brings us up close to Memorial Health, which also has about 22% to 23% market.","So we see this particular segment of the community as growing faster than the rest of the community. It gives us a new market, as I mentioned. We have significant infrastructure in Houston already given the size of our system, and we think that infrastructure can be leveraged to add value to these institutions, and we look forward to getting more information on them as we develop our strategies for integrating them into the system.","Houston is in a bit of a general economic challenge right now, as most people know, but we believe this segment of the city is growing, like I said, faster than the community as a whole. But over the long run, we see Houston as a very important market to HCA, and a market with a great deal of resiliency, and will provide good prospects for us in the future.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thanks, Whit.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Apologies if you already mentioned this, but you gave us some details on the revenue run rate of the acquisitions. Can you tell us anything about what the EBITDA run rate is, and what you think the potential is to ramp the margins closer to the company level?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you. Milton, do you want to...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Sure, yeah. So looking at the seven hospitals in total, as I mentioned in my comments, it will \u2013 annualized revenues will be about $1.5 billion, and the price we paid was basically just slightly over $1.4 billion, so we paid about \u2013 a revenue multiple of around 0.9 to 0.95. And so that implies the margin here is probably somewhere in the low to mid single digits in the aggregate on the group of seven, and we believe that over the next two to three years, we have opportunity to make significant improvements in the margins with, like I said, bringing both our scale and operational tactics and strategies to these new markets and these facilities. We think we can improve the margins over the next two or three years to hopefully in the mid teens.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I wanted to dig into the commentary around the volume softness in the quarter. I think last quarter, the tone that I was getting was that really the softness was driven by some capacity constraints on your end. It seems to me like the tone this quarter is more about general market softness in your markets, and I just wanted to see. I guess do you view this as a blip? And how do you think about 2% to 3% long-term volume growth over the next couple of years (25:02) the next couple of years?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Kevin, thanks. Sam, do you want to take a shot first?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","We continue to believe that HCA's markets in total are going to grow in that 2% to 2.5% from an adjusted admissions standpoint with respect to demand. And so if we can maintain market share, we should be in that particular zone for volume growth.","There are ups and downs from one quarter to the other, just like any other business would have for us, and this was a difficult quarter from a comparison standpoint because we lost a day. And losing a day clearly means we lose outpatient activity and we lose certain inpatient activities as well, so it presents some comparison challenges. But when we pull up from that and look at what we'll call the normalized effect, we felt it was a reasonable volume quarter. It's not necessarily as strong in some areas as we would have hoped, and we need to make some adjustments and we are making adjustments where we can to address that.","As far as capacity constraints go, that probably affected some of our facilities, but when I pull it all the way up to the company level, I don't think on a composite level it necessarily affected our volume performance in the quarter. There are, like I said, certain institutions that really have to manage their utilization and capacity very effectively to create growth prospects for them in the short run. We're addressing that in the long run with a number of our capital projects, so that can periodically present some individual facility challenges. But I don't see that as driving all the way to the company and explaining the company's measures.","Our growth strategies I think are very comprehensive. They are resourced very timely and I think sufficiently, and our execution has been good. But we do compete against some very formidable systems, and we have to continually look for ways to up our game, detail our business better, and provide some advantage for the company. And we're doing that in a lot of areas, and I think we'll continue to find ways to improve upon that. So we remain very optimistic with our overall volume picture, with a few challenges here and there in the short run.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Milt, did you want to add something?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yes, let me just add one other thought to that to Sam's comments, too. I think when you look at the rest of the year, our volume comps get somewhat easier. As Sam mentioned, based on the market share information we had and looking at market demand, we had strong market demand starting in 2014, really through the first quarter of 2016. The demand's rate of growth slowed starting in the second quarter of 2016. So I think as we think about our growth for the rest of the year relative to volume, we will be comping to periods where the volume growth was lower than the first quarter of 2016. So I think too we've got to take that into consideration as we think about the outlook for the rest of the year.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joshua Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the color you guys gave, Sam, on the commercial volume changes. The two things I didn't hear were flu. I'm curious if that has an impact on your payer mix; and then secondarily, a movement to outpatient. Do you tend to see more commercial patients moving to outpatient as opposed to seniors? I'm just curious if those two factors are having any impact.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Our flu volume was up in 2017 as compared to 2016, and most of that was concentrated, I'll say, in the Medicare book, so that did produce some growth in Medicare. I don't think it affected our commercial book in any significant way.","The movement from inpatient to outpatient typically is in surgical areas more than it is anywhere else. And our surgery growth on the inpatient was up 0.9%, and we were down a little bit on the outpatient. I think most of the outpatient decline is centered around two things; one, the calendar being a little bit of that. And then secondly, it's a fairly competitive field when you get into outpatient surgeries with other centers, other hospitals, other physicians in their own clinics and so forth. So again, we are adding capabilities in our outpatient surgery platform, and we're working with our physicians to find ways to leverage that further. But I don't think there was much transition in this cycle from inpatient to outpatient creating any unique pressure.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Josh, thank you.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Is there any way to roughly split out \u2013 or how you see the payer mix pressures between sort of exchange-related issues versus core commercial? And then you'd mentioned economic issues in your markets as well as, or in some markets, as well as HIX payer dynamics. Just hoping you could flesh that out for us. Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Sam or Bill?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Go ahead on the commercial piece.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","HIX was down what...","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","So our HIX volume was down 5%. And as Milton \u2013 sorry, Sam mentioned, we did have a couple of dynamics in our Texas markets. But overall, our HIX volume is kind of tracking with what we see enrollment in our states with some pluses and minuses going on, so we'll see how that tracks for the remainder of the year.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","And the payer dynamics in Texas that I was alluding to are centered around the fact that we didn't know exactly where the lives in a couple of markets were going to land. And so it took us until the first quarter to see that. And so in Houston, San Antonio and Austin, we did see some pressure on our HIX volumes as a result of the lives landing in certain payers' lap, if you will, that weren't contracted for us because we did not think the rates were sufficient. So we had those dynamics affecting us in those three markets. That was really isolated mostly to those markets. We do have access to HIX lives, but the payer relationships that we have in those markets did not gain some of the business that we anticipated, and so that created a little bit of pressure for us.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","And can I just add on to that? As you know, for the past couple years in health reform, the first quarter has been where we've seen significant growth in HIX volume. It just didn't happen this year. If you look at first quarter of 2016, we had HIX volume growth of 27% that just wasn't present in this quarter due to the enrollment activity as well.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, and this is Milton. I'll just add that, Ralph, to deconstruct the payer mix shift between commercial and HIX is complicated further by here in 2017 that there's a lot of movement in lives between HIX and commercial. And so it makes really understanding that deconstructing a little more complicated, too, and harder to understand, but I think we've given you our best view of it.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Good. Thank you, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up there. Three of the markets that you mentioned as seeing disproportionate weakness were Orlando, South Florida and Vegas. Anything specific in those markets that you could call out for us?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yes, in Las Vegas, that's the market that I was referring to where we had both UHS and Dignity get back into two payer contracts that in the past few years they weren't in, and that's resulted in some commercial market share pressures in that particular market. In Orlando, we've seen our competitor systems make some significant investments in a couple of areas that has impacted our business there. Both South Florida and West Florida were particularly impacted by softer tourism, number one, and a little bit softer Emergency Room volume than we had seen in the past. Those were the primary drivers in those markets.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks everyone. On the \u2013 obviously you got the Texas deals, but you also have the two you've mentioned now in Georgia as well. Would you say that you're seeing a pickup in activity level out there? Is your posture towards transactions that have been there before maybe becoming more committed to doing acquisitions? And can you give us a sense of how this affects your ongoing buyback activity?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, all right. That's one for Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, A.J, so I think I mentioned over the last \u2013 one of the last calls we talked about the pipeline being a little more active, but not just with number of maybe opportunities, but the possibility that some of these opportunities could actually come to closure. And I think over the last couple days, and last week, we certainly have been able to deliver that. So the pipeline remains active, so we will see if we can continue to achieve some opportunities for growth through acquisitions. So from that front, yes, it is more active than, say, over the past couple years.","Relative to how it affects our buyback, the transactions, the roughly $1.4 billion that these transactions would \u2013 in terms of purchase price, it's not going to affect our share buyback approach. We intend to continue to buy back our stock throughout the rest of this year, with the authorization that we have. That was our intention when the authorization was approved by the board back in 2016. So we're continuing that plan undisturbed by these acquisitions. And we've been clear to indicate, too, I think, over the past couple of years with our strengthening balance sheet, free cash flow that we have the ability to both be an active buyer of hospitals that make sense for us and also an active buyer of our stock and so we intend to continue to do both.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","A.J., thank you.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Bill, just a question on salaries and benefits, that's obviously up year over year and sequentially. Is there anything you would call out, any trends? And also, just an update on nurse hiring and nurse wages.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, I'll start with the trends and let Sam talk about nurse. I've characterized our labor environment, really, for the past several quarters at pretty stable. When we look at labor combined with productivity, wage rates, it's been very stable for us. The labor costs per adjusted admission at a little north of 2% is a pretty good number for HCA. And again, I think it's pretty stable. Contract labor has stabilized on us. We've got a lot of initiatives in the HR around nurse retention and recruitment, and I think those continue to provide benefit for the company.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sam. The only thing I would add to that is our RN turnover, nursing turnover, has actually improved 110 basis points from where it was last year at this particular point in time. So we are seeing some improvement from some of the initiatives that we have implemented. Our nursing contract labor was only up 5.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have some other areas where we're investing in contract labor. That's why you see roughly 10% in our year-over-year growth. But that's due to some outsourced departments in certain ancillary areas. So we believe that our nursing initiatives, our HR initiatives and so forth are poised to continue to support this effort and deliver some value to the company in this area.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Thanks guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I know you've talked a lot about the commercial volumes and the details behind what happened in the first quarter, but I guess I'm still trying to get a better sense for what is assumed in guidance for the rest of the year in terms of, Sam, you highlighted a bunch of factors here, what you think will actually get better as you move through the year, and what will serve as a pressure point throughout 2017? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Bill or Sam?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Let me kind of give you the broad brush on guidance first, and then let Sam and Milton add in. So obviously, we know we've reaffirmed our guidance going through the balance of the year. We've got variables that I think give us comfort in that. We look at the low end of our guidance for the balance of the year basically implies a 3% growth in the last three quarters to the high end at 7%, midpoint just around 5%.","So as we look at the balance of the year, as Sam mentioned, we look at our volume portfolio, comps get better in the second half of the year. We still believe that 2% to 3% volume guidance is achievable for the company, coupled with our 2% to 3% pricing going forward. Our teams continue to manage our costs pretty well. You look at specifically in the commercial book, as Milton mentioned earlier, you saw those commercial trends start to decline in the last half of the year, so the first quarter still gave us a pretty good comp as our commercial grew just under 3% in the first quarter of 2016. So we think as we go through the year, that gives us confidence that we can stand behind our guidance at this point.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Just interested in an update on where you expect leverage will end the year, just in the context of the acquisitions that you're doing. And then I just had a separate follow-up question just around supply costs, and if you could give us an update there. It looks like they had ticked up a bit over the last couple of quarters, so just wondering if that's on the drug side or anything else that's going on there. Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Scott. I think Bill...","William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I'll take that. On the leverage, as we stated, we're 3.83 times basically right now. Clearly, we've got the balance sheet capacity going forward. It will go up slightly, maybe 10 basis points by the end of the year if we get all these transactions completed. But again, as Milton said, we are optimistic in the earnings performance that that will continue to go back to current levels, well within our range to 3.5 to 4.5 times right now. So again, I think the balance sheet remains pretty strong.","On the supply cost side, you're right. I did mention it was mainly due to some increase in device costs, mainly for some high-acuity volume. Overall, we're very pleased with our supply cost trends. If you look over a longer-term trend, we've been able to manage our supply costs on a per-adjusted admission basis at that 1.5% to 2%. Obviously, continued strong performance by our GPO HealthTrust Purchasing Group, a lot of initiatives in the supply chain operations as well as partnering with our clinical teams in certain clinical initiatives.","So the device cost that we saw this quarter was really entirely due to volume growth in some of these high-acuity procedures, such as TAVR cases. We've seen our TAVR cases increase approximately 70% versus last year. You know this is a high supply cost area with the cost of new valves. We've also seen an increase in certain neurological cases, which include some implantable stimulator devices. So overall, given the volume growth, the supply cost trends don't surprise us, and we're pretty confident with our supply chain processes today.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Two somewhat unrelated \u2013 forgive me, but the first one is just a detail. On ER visits, Sam, I think you said that they were down in the hospital-based ERs, and all of the growth was recorded in the freestandings. How did that dynamic develop? In other words, what's causing that, do you think?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I think there are a lot of alternative supply for patients to consider on the lower acuity side. Most of our declines were in lower acuity levels in our facilities, so that's what we saw. Our higher acuity visits, the top three categories were up. The lower acuity, the bottom three were down, and the net of that was slightly down in our facilities. I think the leap year effect is part of that as well. So I think we're actually up if you normalize for leap year. But nonetheless, it was much slower growth in the hospitals. We've added units in the freestanding emergency room, and they're embedded in our facilities. And so that's part of the growth that we've seen on the freestanding side as well. But even on a same-store freestanding basis, we're up more than we were up on the hospital side.","The other thing I would say is we're using our freestanding emergency room strategy for two things: one for outreach; and then secondly, for quicker capacity relief where we need it. We continue to operate our hospital-based units at almost 90% of our targeted utilization per bed, and so the freestanding emergency room tactic and deployment is a quicker way to market for capacity, plus it puts us in some instances in a different geography that complements our core hospital, so that would be part of the discussion as well.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, thank you, Sheryl. And I think we've got time for just a couple more.","Operator","Okay, great. And we'll go next to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. On the Medicare waiver funding, where the administration is not only for the LIP [Low Income Pool] program in Florida more broadly, can you give us a sense or any color on the impact of that or the economics to you this year and in 2018?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","Ana, I'll go ahead and take this. We still don't have a lot of clarity around the waiver process. We do anticipate there will be increasing waiver requests coming from the states. We have seen the Florida request come in. That one is still pending. The CMS and State of Florida are negotiating the terms and conditions of that LIP increase that's been proposed. So we have no idea at this point exactly how much would ultimately come to Florida, and then if any of that would find its way to us. And again, other states, we'll just watch and see how the year plays out, but we haven't built anything into our expectations for material changes in any waivers for the balance of the year.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thanks (45:14). Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. One clarification, one question. Just clarifying, and I apologize if I missed you saying this, but the Oklahoma children's divestiture and then all these several acquisitions you announced yesterday, none of that's in the guidance that you've affirmed at this point, correct?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","That is correct, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and then just my question: just trying to look through the shift in payer mix, and about 100 basis points year-over-year shift on the inpatient side to Medicare. Looking back last year, you had a similar 100 basis point shift in 2Q and 3Q, and generated EBITDA growth through that, so just trying to think about what's unique about this shift in the first quarter, outside of just the leap year. If there's anything else to add on that.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I'm not sure I could give you a specific explanation. There's a lot of pieces and parts to a quarter, as you well know, and so the puts and takes are difficult to just sit here and synthesize down to one point or two points. But there may have been something unique...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.","I think Sam, I look back, I think what I would call probably our surgical volume was higher overall, I think back in those periods, it resulted in higher revenue per equivalent admission. So for example, we'd reported this first quarter 1.7% growth. You go back and look at the second and third quarter which are the periods I think you were talking about, Gary, and our NREA growth was 2.1% in the second quarter and 2.7%, so 100 basis points higher in the third quarter. So certainly that is the reason for better performance, and hence it's not just for the payer mix, but the underlying service mix as well.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.","All right, Gary, thank you very much. And, operator, we thank you very much, as well. And we'll talk to you all soon.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Kimbrough","Well, thank you for the promotion, Ian. I appreciate that very much. Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and Bill Rutherford, our CFO, which will provide comments on the company's results for the second quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's second quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today.","I will now turn the call over to Sam.","Sam Hazen","Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported our second quarter results. The results were driven by positive trends in the following areas, solid volume growth, cost metrics that were mostly in line with our expectations and good performance from our acquisitions. These positive results were offset by slower growth in revenue per equivalent admissions which resulted in reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA that were slightly below are our internal expectations.","Adjusted EBITDA grew by approximately 3% to $2.3 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin at 18.2%. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $2.25, which was down 2.6% from last year. We have carefully reviewed what drove this lower revenue growth and importantly we don't believe it represents a headwind with respect to achieving our four years earnings guidance. Bill will provide the details in his comments.","Revenue grew by almost $1.1 billion, a 9.3% increase. This increase was driven by volume growth broadly across our markets, service lines and by revenue generated from our recent acquisitions. On a same facilities basis, revenue grew by 4.3%. Inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions grew 2.1% and 2.6%, respectively. Emergency room visits grew 3% and total surgeries were up modestly. We have now grown same facilities inpatient admissions in 21 consecutive quarters. Inpatient market share trends remained positive for the company.","Based upon an analysis of our results and year-to-date performance, we are confident in the second half of the year. We have not seen any major structural changes within our markets from a competitive standpoint, physician standpoint, payor standpoint or execution standpoint. The fundamentals in our markets remain strong with growing demand for healthcare services. We continue to believe we are well-positioned for growth as we execute our operational initiatives, improve the overall competitive positioning of our local healthcare systems and integrate our acquired hospitals. The strategic investments we are making to expand the inpatient and outpatient capacity within our networks and improve our clinical capabilities create more opportunity for patients to access high-quality convenient care in an HCA Healthcare facility.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rutherford","Okay. Thank you Sam and good morning everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the second quarter results. Then we will open the call for questions.","As Sam mentioned, our volume stats were solid and I will provide some additional information. During the second quarter same facility Medicare admissions increased 2.5% and equivalent admissions increased 3.2%. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 3.2% and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our same facility commercial admissions were flat while equivalent admissions increased 1.9% in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.1% in the second quarter compared to the prior year and was in line with our expectations.","When looking at our 3% growth in emergency room visits in the quarter, our level one through three visits increased 0.6%, while our higher acuity level four and five visits increased 4.9% over the prior year. In addition, admissions through the emergency room increased 3% over the prior year. Same facility net revenue per equivalent admissions grew 1.7% over the prior year in the quarter. This growth rate was lower than our recent results, which has averaged 1.5% to 2% higher.","So let me give you a little more information on factors that affected this in the quarter. And there were two primary drivers I would like to call out. Our commercial revenue growth was softer in the quarter, primarily because admissions were flat and there was a moderation of our acuity growth in the quarter, which was primarily driven by decline in inpatient surgeries. The second item is that we had some favorable revenue items last year across some state's supplemental and graduate medical education programs that did not reoccur this year.","Our total adjusted EBITDA impact from these supplemental programs was approximately $65 million, which was primarily attributable to revenue. We do not believe the supplemental programs will be a headwind for the remainder of the year. Our year-to-date revenue performance is in line with our full year expectations. Year-to-date same facility net revenue per equivalent admission has increased 3%, which is within our guidance range of 2% to 3% for 2019.","So let me move on operating expenses. Operating expenses per equivalent admission for the second quarter were consistent with recent trends. Our same-store operating cost per adjusted admission grew 3.1% over the prior year in the quarter. While our cost as a percent of revenue did increase in the quarter, we view this as a function of the softer revenue growth I discussed previously. Our recent acquisitions had an approximate 80 basis points unfavorable impact on margins for the quarter.","Same facility labor trends were consistent with recent trends in prior year. Man-hours per adjusted patient day and employee per occupied bed, two key productivity indicators, both improved 0.8% compared to the prior year. Same facility average hourly rate grew 2.6% in the quarter versus prior year. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission grew 2.1% over the prior year period. Same facility other operating expense per adjusted admission roast 3.6%, mainly due to a change in some state's supplemental program expenses, which I mentioned earlier.","In summary, while our revenue results were softer than our expectations, our adjusted EBITDA was only about 1.5% below our internal expectations. And overall, we remain pleased with our year-to-date performance.","So let me take a moment to talk about cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $2 billion versus $1.58 billion in the second quarter of last year. Capital spending for the second quarter was $964 million, in line with our expectations. During June 2019, we issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and used the proceeds to temporarily reduce the outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving credit facility. During July 2019, we redeemed $4.95 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes. Pretax losses on retirement of debt totaling $211 million for these redemptions will be recognized during the quarter ending September 30, 2019.","During the second quarter, we paid $242 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares and had $1.75 billion remaining on our previous authorization as of June 30, 2019. Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.7 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.83 times. However, the amount available under our revolving credit facilities would have been $2.47 billion and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio would event 3.66 times after giving effects to our July 5, 2019 debt redemptions. As noted in our release, we adjusted our full year 2019 guidance with projected adjusted EBITDA to range between $9.6 million and $9.85 billion and projected EPS to range between $10.25 and $10.65.","So let me turn the call back over to Sam before we go to Q&A.","Sam Hazen","Thank you Bill. Before we go to Q&A, I want to make four more points. First, our management teams are relentlessly focused on executing our agenda as we have always been. Secondly, we are confident in what we are doing and our outlook for 2019. Third, periodically we have quarterly results that don't reflect our longer run beliefs. The first quarter was that and the second quarter was also that. That's why we believe year-to-date performance is more indicative. And fourth, where appropriate we are making adjustments to our cost structure as we historically have done.","So with that, Ian, let's go into questions-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Pito Chickering","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to drill down a little bit more on the inpatient admissions for your commercial book of business, a couple of questions. Can you sort of talk about different markets, if that weakness was widespread among the markets? You talked about some more competition. Did you see some markets that had increased competition from that? And then also on strategic investments, you guys are continuing to invest in inpatient business. Does the 2Q results change your view of making those investments?","Sam Hazen","All right. Pito, thank you. This is how I would answer that question. We had 12 of 14 domestic divisions that had admission growth. We had 12 of 14 adjusted admissions or divisions that had adjusted admissions growth. On the managed care side, we had eight divisions that were up, two that were flat and four that were down. On surgeries, in total we had nine divisions that were up, one was flat and four was down. So generally speaking, our portfolio performed pretty well. We did have a couple of markets that were softer than we anticipated. We understand what those drivers are. We think we have the appropriate responses in place to deal with them and we will continue to execute on those.","To give you a few more statistics on the volume side, which again, the company had a very productive volume quarter. Rehab admissions were up 8%. As Bill said, our emergency room visits were up 3%. Our trauma was up almost 15%. We had tremendous growth again in our cardiac volumes with our PCI volume, our cardiac CAT volume up 2.5%, electrophysiology up 4%, CV surgery up 4.5%. So we had a very broad based, as I mentioned in my comments, service line growth and also division wide growth.","The issue is, we were a little bit softer in total for our managed care admissions, as Bill alluded to and that did put some pressure in the quarter on our revenue. I don't think it significantly changes our thinking around investments. As I mentioned, we believe our strategy is appropriate for the market. We continue to invest in it in an appropriate way in my opinion and we think it will produce opportunities for the company to generate growth in the future.","Pito Chickering","Great. And one follow up. If the weak commercial story continues in the back half of the year, what levers do you guys have available on the cost side to react to the softness?","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Pito, this is Bill. Let me try to address that. As Sam mentioned, our teams are making adjustments every day. We have great operators and we are obviously proud of the work they do. We manage productivity daily, even hourly matching our labor trends to projected volume. And I mentioned our productivity gains in the comments. We have process improvement teams throughout our operations who work in a variety of cost efficiencies such as throughput in the emergency room and OR, also working with our clinical teams on clinical efficiencies. We benchmark ourselves to our best performers on a wide range of metrics and identify improvement opportunities.","We continue to strive for cost efficiencies in our support structures and continuing to leverage size of scale, which we have been doing for some time in revenue cycle, supply chain, information technology support, human resources and the like. And then as Sam mentioned, we will look for fixed costs and overhead reductions, where appropriate and where we believe we have the opportunity. So we continue to believe we have appropriate control systems around managing our cost structure. As we step back, we don't cost management was the issue for the quarter. We continue to make adjustments where we believe is appropriate and will continue to do that in the future.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Pito.","Pito Chickering","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.","Steve Tanal","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess I just wanted to focus on the revenue per adjusted admission, the metric there and some the drivers you called out. So forgive me for being specific here but there is a few things I wanted to touch on. The lapping of the $65 million of supplemental payments in the second quarter, was the expectation that that would recur? I just don't remember that as a call out last year and just thinking through that, I think the size of that is maybe 60 bips or so. You framed 150 to 200 basis point delta versus recent trends on the metrics. So is it sort of fair to say that the biggest driver within there was with sort of commercial volumes? And any reason why that slowed? Maybe how widespread it was? Just really trying to understand if that's just a function of sort of low unemployment, more macro driven or if there is anything more specific you could tell us about that. And finally, just an acuity mix read would be helpful. I don't know if I missed that, but those are the three parts to that question.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Thanks Steve. Let me start. So on the supplemental payments on there, we did not expect that to reoccur. We didn't call it out in 2018, because it wasn't really an issue on a year-over-year basis because we had at least two of the three programs we mentioned in 2017 and 2018. As we went through our budget process, we knew those wouldn't reoccur. So they were not in our internal plan as we went forward in 2019. So that's why our internal plan, we weren't that far off on our performance for the level.","On the managed care volume, as Sam mentioned, it's a handful of markets. We did see our commercial surgical volume decline in that area. That did flow through on the acuity in a couple of service lines. But as Sam mentioned, we don't think that we see any structural or significant changes across the marketplace. So that influenced both the volume and the flow-through to acuity related to that.","Steve Tanal","Okay.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Steve.","Steve Tanal","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi everybody. I just wanted to, picking up on Sam's comments towards the end there, the little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter. I mean that seems to be something we are seen across the sector. Obviously, one of your peers had the exact opposite, really soft first quarter and a strong second quarter and surgeries were part of that. Do you think there is anything going on, either with benefit design changes, I don't know, terms of your managed care contracts? When people talk about the deductibles and high-deductible plans and that having an impact on traditional seasonality, is there any way you can look at the calendar, I know the calendar is different in the way some of the holidays fell this year versus last year? Or is there anything else that you think is creating a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter where you still end up the same point for the year, but maybe the seasonal patterns are not what they used to be exactly?","Sam Hazen","A.J., this is Sam. I don't know that we have anything that would suggest the seasonal patterns are changing on us. I mean we went through a period of time, as we have discussed on these calls in the past, where we felt there was some migration to outpatient procedures in the last part of the year because of deductibles and holidays and so forth. So we tend to see some outpatient surgical activity and procedure activity increase in the fourth quarter. But as it relates to the first half of the year, I don't know that we have any indications that seasonality factors are changing on us. I think my point was that, you know, the first quarter was incredibly good for HCA and had tremendous, like mid teens same stores growth, if I remember correctly and we just felt that we had a perfectly good quarter that yielded tremendous bottomline results. And then we looked at the second quarter and it just didn't play out as we had anticipated entirely. Not that far off, as Bill indicated. And so, when we sort of pull up and look at the business and then look at our markets and we just completed our midyear reviews with our divisions, we feel pretty good about where we are on a year-to-date basis and we think that's fairly reflective of our business and how it should play out over the remainder of the year. And so, that's why we sort of called it out that way. But we will continue to study. We will hopefully get a good indicator here in the third quarter and move through the year as we think. But there is nothing to suggest that seasonality has played into this in any material way.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you A.J.","A.J. Rice","I think the managed care companies have pointed to an extra business day in the third quarter is a bit of a headwind for them. Is that something out that -- is that enough to move the needle, in your mind for you guys at all?","Sam Hazen","Well, clearly, with an extra business day, we will have more procedures most likely because of that. So whether or not, over the course of the whole quarter that will have a material impact, we will just have to wait and see. But business days to influence our surgical activity and some of our procedure activity.","A.J. Rice","Okay.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks A.J. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Thank you. You may go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Sam, I appreciate the comments on the confidence in the second half EBITDA run rate. Given the weaker commercial volumes in acuity in the second quarter, I am curious whether that confidence is a function of management expecting commercial trends to return to previous levels in the second half? Or whether you are driving cost improvements that will allow you hit these numbers even if the commercial trends continue at those second quarter levels?","Sam Hazen","Well, I would say, it's a bit of a blend. It's not one or the other. I don't think the second quarter is necessarily reflective of commercial volumes. We have had, I think, six straight quarters where we have had adjusted admission growth in our commercial activity. I think five straight quarters heading into the second quarter where we had inpatient commercial admission growth. So we don't necessarily see anything changing within the markets, as I have mentioned, that would suggest that the second quarter is the marker for us as we move forward. But when you do bump up our expectations for some rebound there plus some cost initiatives where we think we have some incremental opportunities for improvement, those two combined, I think, Justin give us a reasonable level of confidence as we look to the last half of the year.","Justin Lake","Okay. If I could just squeeze in a quick number - I got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And now we will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe call out the specific service lines where you saw the pressure that drove the lower acuity? And then I think in the past you have given managed care revenue, I think, per admission. So hoping you can kind of give that for the second quarter? And then the last thing, just anything to call out on bad debt or collection rate that could maybe influence the revenue capture and pricings data in the quarter? Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Ralph, let me try to take some of those. When we look at the service lines, it was in some of our spine surgical procedures, orthopedics and some women services. We think on the orthopedic side on the commercial, we could have caught some of that as they moved into the outpatient area. But it's mainly in the spine and women services and the same metric spread among a handful of markets on there.","On the collection rates, we are not seeing any material change in our collection rates. Our net days actually had declined on us for the year. So we continue to feel very comfortable with our revenue cycle operations. And the net revenue per admission for our commercial side was running 3.5% on a revenue per admission in the second quarter.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you.","Sam Hazen","Thanks Ralph.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sam Hazen","Hi Brian.","Brian Tanquilut","Hello Sam. Can you hear me?","Sam Hazen","Yes, now we can. Yes.","Brian Tanquilut","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on price transparency. Obviously, as CMS came out with a proposal yesterday and how do you think that plays out and where do you think HCA is positioned if that actually goes through in terms of pricing and where you stand in the markets that you operate in? Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. This is Bill. I will take a stab at that. Obviously, it's early. We just got that last night. We are still interpreting that. We have been on record that HCA supports price transparency and we believe that's helping our patients gain a reasonable understanding and estimate of the cost prior to service. So we support those efforts.","We will have to see an implementation in terms of the specific procedures out there our approach to complying with that and we think HCA will continue to show good value. We don't know exactly where we stand relative to others in the marketplace and we think that will create some opportunities, maybe some challenges there. But we think, again, the HCA system will stand up well on a price transparency view.","Sam Hazen","Yes. Let me just add to that, Bill. I think a couple of things. Over the past five to 10 years, we have been on this journey to try to narrow the band amongst our payors so that there is not a large delta between the lowest payor and the highest payor. And we have a delta but it's not significant and we have narrowed it significantly over time. So that's point number one.","Point number two, we think we are competitive in the marketplace. Otherwise, we would not be accomplishing contract renewals at the pace that we are. And for 2020, we are about 80% contracted. And for 2021, we are about 60% contracted at what I would call normal inflationary trends. Therefore, I believe we are generally competitive.","To Bill's point, there could be a market here or there where we are under a competitor. We believe that in a handful of cases, there could be a market here or there where maybe we are in a better position from a he pricing standpoint and we will just have to sort that out over time. But at this point, we are focused on the patient and getting the patient the necessary information for them to understand their cost.","So we are going to go through this comment period that CMS has offered and make sure we push forward appropriate thoughts and appropriate ideas on dealing with the patient and it will determine whether or not there is an appropriate way to deal with other kind of pricing that is embedded in the proposed rule.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Brian, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. Hate beating this issue, but could you tell just a little bit may be about on the commercial volumes side, how that progressed and tracked through much of the second quarter? And did you seeing any kind of change in that by the end of the quarter? And then just also want to confirm, no major losses of contract? Nothing when out of network during the quarter? And then any country around the surprise billing legislation? Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Frank, let me try. The quarter, you have to align, we mentioned it before, on our business days. April had a favorable business day. June, you had one less business day. So I normalize for that. But I don't think we, you know, see any intra-quarterly trends of any material nature in the trends that we are talking about.","Relative to surprise billing, I don't think there is any new developments out there. We have, you know, worked with various policymakers and industry leaders to express our views on surprise billing and we will see where that ultimately finalizes. But we don't think that's an issue for us in the near term as we as we look at various proposed legislations that out there.","Frank Morgan","Anything about out of network during the quarter?","Bill Rutherford","No. We haven't lost any material contract or any material out of network activity.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank Brian.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It's from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the question. I understand you guys are saying it's really a cost side of the issue and I think I heard a couple of comments around labor. But maybe you could just flesh that out? Was there any increase in temporary labor? Are you seeing any shortages in specific markets, any specific lines, et cetera that caused any potential changes in the volumes? Or is it really steady as she goes on the labor front?","Bill Rutherford","I think it's pretty consistent. When we look at the overall labor trends, as I mentioned in my comments, josh, our productivity improves. We improved just under 1% for the quarter. Our wage rates at 2.6% are in line with our expectations. Our temporary and contract labor has remained stable recent. We are very proud of the efforts our operators are making on that front. We are running nice turnover ratios in there. So again, when we step back and look at the cost trends and when we manage our per unit basis, they are very consistent with our trends. We recognize per as a percentage of revenue, they are showing some growth. But just as in the first quarter when you got really solid commercial growth it helps the per revenue stats and the opposite occurred in the second quarter. But when we look at how we are managing the cost on a volume basis, they are remaining relatively and stable in our view across all categories, labor and supplies, at that standpoint.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you Josh.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question from Whit Mayo of UBS. Please go ahead.","Whit Mayo","Hi. Thanks, One quick clarification. Can you provide what state supplemental program actually changed and why it was different versus your expectation? And then my real question was just on the Houston market. I think you have recently come out of a rebranding initiative and announced a new affiliation with a large medical school. Just looking for any commentary on the market. Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Whit, let me start. The two supplemental programs that were the drivers were a graduate medical education bonus program we had received that didn't reoccur. That was principally in Florida. And then we had a disproportionate share settlement that was principally going back to Colorado in some past years. So those were the two major programs. And then we had a little bit of change in our California supplemental that showed down in our operating expenses. So those were the three. The remaining programs, as we said, we view as stable and we think those issues are behind us. We don't see them creating a headwind going forward on there.","And then relative to Houston market, Sam?","Sam Hazen","Yes. We are in a turnaround, I would say, in Houston. We struggled for a couple of years, as we have called out on this call in the past. And I think this year, we have started our recovery and we are seeing pretty good results from some of our initiatives to grow our business. We have seen some results with respect to consolidating some excess capacity. The new acquisition we did in the Northwest side of town is going to be a nice acquisition for us. So all-in-all, the branding, I think, the re-purposing of some assets, the focus that the team has put forth in that market is starting to show results. We think the macros in Houston have turned a little bit where we are starting to see job growth again and see a slightly better payor mix in that market than what we have seen historically. So we are pretty pleased with the first six months of the year's performance in Houston and believe some of the other initiatives, strategically, that we have in place including branding are going to be productive for us. The graduate medical education program that you speak to is in an early stage and has really not yielded anything yet but we think over time, it will be a valuable program for us in the Houston market.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you Whit.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. So when you talk about seeing competition in the market, how exactly is it presenting today? So are you talking more from surgical referrals, branding or where you sit and ensure efficiency networks and how that presents to the consumer? So if you could give us some color on where the big competition is now in your industry, that would be helpful.","Sam Hazen","Well, I will try to generalize it as best I can. Obviously, it's market-to-market and somewhat competitor-to-competitor. I think the unique thing about HCA and we have mentioned this before, is we don't compete against the same systems from one market to the other. We believe fundamentally that creates competitive advantage for us as we look to deliver best practice solutions from one market to the other or allocate resources in a more timely manner.","I think generally speaking, most of our competitors are trying to do a lot of what we are trying to do. They are trying to attract physicians. They are trying to create outpatient capabilities that are responsive to the markets and so forth. And so I think from that standpoint, those are always won and lost in my opinion, when it comes down to execution, when it comes down to detailing your business and your relationships with physicians and so forth and then really creating a compelling offering for the patient.","And we think that's in HCA's wheelhouse. And so we have been about that for many years and we will continue to be about that. And we think it's that level of execution and such that ultimately delivers market share gains. Again, we are growing our market share on the inpatient side, as we have mentioned. We have actually grown our market share from a commercial standpoint. We don't have the second quarter of 2019 yet. So we have fairly broad-based market share performance. When you look at the most recent available data, which is all of 2018, we had two-thirds of our markets grow their market share. The company, in total, is at an all-time high on both overall market share as well commercial market share. So we think our approach to building out comprehensive and clinically capable networks that are easy to access for our patients, very responsive to our physicians and produce a positive outcome for our payors, for our patients and others is yielding results and we will continue to focus on that and we will continue to resource that as we move forward and we think that's going to be a successful model for us.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Sarah.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question. It's from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning. My question is on same-store outpatient surgery cases. If I look at Q1, you are up 1.3%. In this quarter, you are up 0.6%. Q1, you should have been negatively affected by the number of days. So this quarter, you would think it will be a little bit stronger. When I look at a year ago, you had a very strong quarter, up 2.6%, in the second quarter. But you had an even stronger quarter in the third quarter for outpatient surgeries. So I am kind of wondering, what happened last year in outpatient surgeries that's perhaps not happening this year, if that's the right way to look at it? And then will the problem be bigger in the third quarter?","Sam Hazen","So let me speak to outpatient surgery. This is Sam. So our hospital-based outpatient surgeries were up 1.9% in the quarter. Our ambulatory surgery center surgical volumes were down 0.6%. And then, our U.K. surgery volumes were down and that influenced sort of the composite. But when you look at our hospital-based outpatient surgery, up almost 2%, that's a pretty good number for us. Some of that was a migration from inpatient in a couple of service lines, as Bill alluded to, but it didn't influence, I think, the aggregate number in any significant way for the company.","In the ambulatory surgery center area, we actually categorize our surgical cases into three tiers, Tier 3 being the most significantly reimbursed, Tier 2 in the middle and Tier 1 at the lowest. When you look at our Tier 1 volumes, they were down significantly. That's some ophthalmology cases, some pain cases and so forth. And that's what influenced the metric for the quarter. I don't recall the specifics in the second quarter of last year. But we feel pretty good about what we are doing with our surgical growth initiatives and our quality and investment initiatives inside of our ORs and we have had a fairly good pattern of growth.","Over time, it does go up and down a little bit from one quarter to the other. Some of that could be calendar, some of it can be this transition that we spoke to, but generally speaking, we had a pretty good metric this quarter with our outpatient surgeries. Again, inpatient surgeries were the metric of concern for us. They were slightly down. Flattish, if you will, domestically, but down with international. And so that created a little bit of pressure. We will have to continue to work on that and monitor that as we move forward. But all-in-all, our surgical activity on the outpatient side, I think, is yielding pretty good results for the company.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Pete.","Peter Costa","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning everybody here. So just sticking with the main topic of the day. I am just curious. I mean are you able to comment on whether the inpatient surgical volumes and\/or revenue per admission are improving in early 3Q 2019, just following the softer result in 2Q?","Bill Rutherford","Yes. This is Bill. See, we do not comment on the current quarter. So we will leave our comments to the period ending June 30 in the second quarter and year-to-date.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Maybe just one other quick question here around North Carolina. I mean there's been some headlines around the proposed state employee contract hospital rates for 2020 and the state wants to move to Medicare reference pricing. Obviously, hospitals do not want to do that. I am just curious, first of all, I mean how critical is that contract within North Carolina? If you able to opine on it, is your bias to stay out of network? Or are you willing to potentially agree to like Medicare reference rates knowing that it could kind of filter into other contracts as well? Just curious to get your thoughts around that topic. Thanks.","Bill Rutherford","This is Bill. I will try. I think that's the point. I don't know and I don't have any data in front of me to suggest that if we move to reference for the state employees that it would have a major impact on our North Carolina operations. But I do think from a precedent standpoint, we don't believe having government dictate fixed pricing, especially Medicare pricing, is an appropriate kind of response to managing health care demand. So I think that's where our focus will be on that topic. I don't view it will be a material issue to HCA as we run it up. And as we go through our 2020 planning, if it becomes an item we will disclose it. But I don't think at this point, that particular issue will be a material issue for us.","Steven Valiquette","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question. It comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Mark Kimbrough","Michael?","Operator","Michael, your line maybe muted. We will move on. We will now take our next question from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning guys. Just asking this question, certainly in the context that there is normal fluctuation between quarter. So I am kind of beating the dead horse a little bit, but just maybe want to ask a slightly different way. When we look at net revenue per adjusted admission on a same-store basis, I mean, the comps do get a little tougher in 3Q and 4Q. So Sam, when you talk about looking at this, analyzing the quarter, reaching a conclusion that there is not a concern with respect to second half guidance. how much of that is looking at the market specific explanations for some of the commercial softness this quarter and being comfortable with whatever issue that might have been and the trajectory versus some of the new cost initiatives that you have talked about?","Sam Hazen","Well, I answered that, I think earlier. I don't remember who asked it. It may have been Justin. But I do think we are not of the mind yet that our commercial volume growth is flattening out. Again, we have had five quarters in a row, heading into the second quarter where we had inpatient admission growth on commercial activity and six quarters heading into the second quarter and now, seven, if you count outpatient where we have had adjusted admission growth. And so, we don't see anything, again, from a structural standpoint whether it's payor, physician, competitor, what have you that would suggest that our trends should just immediately change.","As it relates to pricing trends, as we sequentially move through the rest of the year, we do typically run about third quarter and second quarter very close. And then we ramp up in the fourth quarter through normal contract provisions that we have and so forth. And we don't see anything at this particular point in time preventing us from being able to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we typically do. Obviously, some of our Medicare increase has come through in the fourth quarter as well.","As we mentioned earlier, we do have a calendar day advantage in the third quarter that tends to produce more commercial activity because of the type of volume we get typically from commercial activity. So there could be some influence there as we work through the quarter. So we are pretty confident in what I will call the structural aspects of our business. And none of those issues suggest that anything has changed in any material fashion that would cause us concern. And that's why we are reiterating our confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to kind of understand a little bit the rationale for the guidance raise. You mentioned that Q2 came in below expectations and yet you are raising the guidance by $150 million. I assume it sounds like you are just saying that Q1 was so strong, you now feel comfortable with those trends. But just trying to understand maybe a little more color about what exactly came into the guidance. Is there anything new in the second half of the year versus what you were expecting? And I guess, we don't have the final regs, I don't know, if DSH at all change in that assumption, but if there is any change in DSH in there, that would be helpful?","Bill Rutherford","Yes. Kevin, this is Bill. Let me try to take that. After the first quarter, we feel that a lot of questions about our guidance adjustment that we made in the first quarter which, you know, we raised our guidance after first quarter $100 million, which was primarily due to that favorable payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter. We indicated we typically wouldn't raise guidance further after just one quarter, but we did just for that settlement. So obviously now the half of the year is behind us. Well, in essence, we did was tighten our guidance by raising the previous low and about $150 million, which obviously effectively raises the midpoint by $75 million.","So as we look at our year-to-date performance, it's an appropriate benchmark, we think, as we have said several times throughout the call for our full year guidance expectations. And if you look at year-to-date, once you adjust for the payor settlement for us, we have grown EBITDA just over 9%. And so our new midpoint suggests just over 9% growth for the second half of the year when you adjust for last year's insurance settlement and the Harvey settlement that we had. So we believe that tightening the guidance range after the second quarter, looking at the midpoint is really consistent with what our year-to-date trends. And so that was really what was behind the tightening and the raising of the midpoint of our guidance after this quarter.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Now we will take our next question. It comes from Matthew Gillmor of Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.","Matthew Gillmor","Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the contribution from recent acquisitions. Did Mission and the 2017 acquisitions contribute about 3% to EBITDA growth again this quarter? Or was that any different? And if you have any sort of general comments about how those deals are going, especially Mission and Savannah, that would be helpful.","Bill Rutherford","Yes. This is Bill. Let me start. So we are very pleased with the performance of the acquisitions and they did have a good quarter. As you mentioned, we anticipated them in our guidance to contribute about 3%. That's what they had in the first quarter. They ran stronger in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we are running about 4% contribution from our acquisitions.","Mission, in particular, continues to perform very well. We are ahead of both our internal expectations and plan at Mission. As did Savannah. Savannah is progressing nicely and had a nice growth in the quarter. So overall, the performance is very strong for the acquisition. I think when we look at the full year, we still think 3% to 4% contribution is probably a good number for all the acquisitions.","And the Houston market is on track as well with our plans. We have made some adjustments in Houston. Our North Cypress acquisition in that market is performing very nicely. So are overall pleased with the performance of the acquisitions in the quarter and a little ahead of our expectations on a year-to-date basis.","Matthew Gillmor","Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks Matthew.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. So I would like to hand the call back to our speakers.","Mark Kimbrough","Okay. Listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I will be around if anyone wants to follow up. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead Sir.","Victor Campbell","Travis, thank you, good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those who are listening in on the webcast. With me here this morning are President and CEO, Milton Johnson; CFO, Executive VP, Bill Rutherford and Sam Hazen, President of Operations; and we have several other members of the management team are here as well to assist during the Q&A if necessary.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. And today's call is being recorded. Replay will become available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton Johnson","Milton Johnson","Thanks Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on our first quarter call and broadcast. We were pleased with our performance for the first quarter as we generally saw continuation of recent trends in many key operating metrics. As Sam will describe in a moment, our market share trends remain positive. Of course this quarter reflects the long awaited first coverage period for expanded Medicaid and helped exchange insurance products.","We saw encouraging signs from healthcare reform during the quarter and found them to be consistent with our early expectations. Bill will provide details on healthcare reform in his comments, but as expected healthcare reform had minimal impact on the company's first quarter results. However we remain optimistic regarding the long term benefits of reform.","We remain comfortable with our previous guidance regarding the estimated impact of healthcare reforms on our financial results for 2014.","Now, moving to the quarter's results, revenues increased to $8.832 billion compared to $8.44 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Net income totalled $347 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $344 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013.","Excluding gains from the sale of facilities and legal claim costs incurred during the quarter, the company would have reported net income per diluted share of $0.84 in the first quarter of 2014.","Adjusted EBITDA of $1.644 billion increased 4.8% in the first quarter of this year over the first quarter of 2013. If you exclude the impact of EHR incentive income and share based compensation expense from both periods, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 6.3%.","Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.6% was flat compared to the prior year. However if you exclude EHR incentive income and share based compensation expense from the adjusted EBITDA for both periods, adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased 30 basis points.","Volume trends were somewhat soft in the quarter, primarily in our lower acuity service line. In-patient surgical growth along a decrease in lower acuity patients resulted in growth in case mix index of 2.2%.","Net revenue per equivalent machine [ph] was favourably impacted as a result and overall expenses were well managed throughout the quarter. Today we are also reaffirming our previous adjusted EBITDA guidance range of 6.6 billion to 6.85 billion for 2014.","And while we are not providing quarterly earnings guidance, I do want to remind everyone that our EBITDA performance in the first half of last year was somewhat uneven. As you may recall, our EBITDA growth in the first quarter of 2013 was below our expectation due to an unfavourable calendar and very soft volumes in the latter part of the quarter. Then in the second quarter, the combination of improved volumes and cost structure resulted in a very strong quarter getting us back on plan by midyear.","So for 2014, we\u2019ve had an easier comparison in the first quarter and we will have a much tougher comparison in the second quarter.","In addition to our solid financial performance, our patient safety and quality of care agenda continue to perform at a very high level. For example, our reduced Mercer study conducted at 43 HCA hospitals and 74 intensive care units and involved approximately 75,000 patients determined that treating all patients with an antiseptic wash and nasal ointment on admission to intensive care not only reduced all infections by 44% but was selected by the Clinical Research Foundation as one of the top 3 contributions in the US in 2013.","With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Hey, great, thank you, Milton and good morning everybody. I will cover some additional detail around the first quarter, then I will turn over to Sam and he will provide some additional commentary on volume and market share information.","As Milton mentioned, we were pleased with the quarter\u2019s results. The first quarter results were driven by solid revenue growth resulting from relatively stable volume and increase intensity of services as well as strong expense management by our operators.","Milton just mentioned our adjusted EBITDA increased $1.644 billion or an increase of 4.8% from the prior year. However adjusting for the reduction in HITECH incentive income and the increase in share base comp, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.3% over the prior year. In the first quarter, our same facility total admissions declined 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions declined 0.3%.","We experienced a 140 basis point reduction in our admissions in the quarter due to declines in pulmonary and one day stays. Adjusting for declines in pulmonary and one day stays, same store admissions grew 0.8%. During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.1% and 0.3% respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare and managed Medicare admissions increased 2% on the same facility basis and represent just under 30% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 2.4% respectively in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. This increase compares to fourth quarter declines of 1.6% in both admissions and adjusted admissions, and this was primarily driven by growth in our four Medicaid expansion states that I will speak to shortly.","Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 2.1% in the quarter while equivalent admissions declined 0.7%. This represented 7.6% of our total admissions compared to 7.4% last year. These results do compare favourably to our fourth quarter 2013 when self-pay and charity admissions and adjusted admissions grew 8.3% and 5.2% respectively.","Managed Care and exchange admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.7% and 2.2% respectively in the first quarter on a same facility basis. And we are combining these two categories until exchange becomes more material.","Same facility emergency room visits were basically unchanged compared to the prior year's first quarter. Self-pay and charity ER visits represent 22.3% compared to 22.4% in the last year's first quarter on a same-facility basis.","Fairly consistent with prior quarters our softer volume was mostly in our lower acuity business and this coupled with continued in-patient surgical growth helped drive stronger revenue intensity. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission in the quarter increased 3.7% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.8% in the first quarter, while case mix increased 1.7%.","Same facility managed care revenue per equivalent admission increased 6.1%, fairly consistent with our prior trends. And case mix increased 2.9% in the quarter.","Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $347 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Of this same facility charity care discounts totalled $921 million in the first quarter and increased to $17 million from prior year, while same facility uninsured discounts totalled $2.277 billion, an increase of $330 million from the first quarter of 2013.","Now let me turn to expenses. Expense management in the quarter remained strong consistent with our recent trends. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.2%, reflecting increased acuity and surgical volume in our patient population.","As you see on a reported basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.9% from 46.4% in last year's first quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% on a same facility basis in the quarter.","Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in the quarter when compared to the prior year and this primarily reflects the service intensity and increased in-patient surgical volume in the quarter.","Other operating expenses increased to 18.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to 18.1% last year, primarily reflecting an increase in insurance utilities and other operating.","We recognized $30 million in electronic health record income for the first quarter compared to $39 million last year. The company also incurred approximately $43 million in EHR related expenses in the quarter compared to $26 million in last year's first quarter, a $26 million drag on first quarter results, somewhat higher than the previous quarters.","Let me take a moment to address cash flow in the quarter. Our cash flow from operations declined from $740 million in Q1 of 2013 to $443 million in Q1 of 2014. This decline's primarily related to $170 million effect increase on working capital and a $206 million negative impact related to income taxes. Last year we received a $185 million tax refund and this year we had a $32 million tax payment.","On working capital there were two items affecting this. We had an increase in other current assets primarily to a growth in an imaging [ph] program receivable and a growth in patient receivables. That's mostly attributable to a growth in our governmental receivables, mainly due to a changing regulatory environment which extending the collection process and we had some growth in receivables in our Texas waiver program as the state has had some backlogs in processing payments. In addition you will see we invested $400 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.","At March 31st, the company's ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.35x compared to 4.32x at December 31st of 2013. At the end of the quarter the company had approximately $4.442 billion of availability under its revolving credit facilities, however on April 2nd, the company paid $2.9 billion to redeem its $1.5 billion, 8.5%, and $1.25 billion of our 7 and 7\/8% notes.","You will note a nearly high cash balance on our balance sheet as of March 31st, and this was due to a bond restructuring awaiting to apply to our call provision executed on April 2nd.","Now let me move into a discussion around health reform. As Milton mentioned we saw encouraging signs related to health reform in the first quarter. When we think about health reform, we will discuss the impact from two views. First, what we experience with exchange volume and activity and secondly what we experience in our Medicaid expansion states. As I begin, let me preface these comments that although we did see encouraging signs that I will share with you, as we estimated reform is still unfolding and had a minimal impact on our results for the quarter.","Relative to exchange volume, we saw just over 1700 exchange admissions in the first quarter of 2014. Remember this is on a base of 440,000 admissions for the company, so about 0.4% of our total admissions. We were encouraged with the progression of this volume that we saw throughout the quarter. In general we saw twice the number of exchange admissions in February than we saw in January and we saw twice the exchange volume in March than we did in February.","Although only a small portion of these have completed the collection cycle, we do anticipate clearing these at rate similar to commercial accounts. A key question for this exchange volume has been and is how much is this volume is from previously uninsured patients versus previously insured conversion into an exchange product.","In an attempt to get some insight into this question we performed an analysis on each of these exchange admissions we saw in the quarter to evaluate had they been seen in an HCA system within the last 12 months, and if so what was the coverage status.","We had seen about half of the exchange population previously and one-third of those served were previously uninsured. So far this is the best data point we have in trying to answer this key question for the exchange volume thus far.","Now let me turn to a discussion around Medicaid expansion impact. A quick reminder, that we have four of our states expand Medicaid which represent about 13% of our bed capacity. California, Colorado, Kentucky and Nevada, in our expansion states we saw Medicaid admission growth of 22.3%, as compared to a 1.3% decline in Medicaid admissions in our non-expansion states. Conversely, we saw a 29% decline in uninsured admissions in these four states as compared to a 5.9% growth in uninsured volume in non-expansion states.","We estimate the impact from these trends in our expansion states is just over 1000 admissions previously uninsured now have Medicaid coverage.","In summary, although reform is still unfolding and still a small percentage of our business, we are encouraged by these early trends and we re-affirm our earlier guidance of health reform impact of 1% to 2% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014.","That concludes my remarks and I'll turn it over the call to Sam for some additional comments.","Sam Hazen","","All right, thank you, Bill, good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on our same facilities volume for the quarter and then provide an update on market share trends for the company.","As you heard pulmonary related admissions were down 9% or almost 4000 admissions as compared to the first quarter of last year. This decline was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflects the soft flu season across the last two quarters.","We saw the same decline in our emergency rooms. Pulmonary related emergency room volume was down 9% or approximately 23,000 visits in the quarter. In total, emergency room visits were mostly flat with prior year. However adjusted for pulmonary related volume, emergency room visits grew by 1.3%.","In-patient surgeries were up 0.9%. This increase was primarily driven by solid growth in the following areas: orthopaedics, general surgery, cardiovascular and transplant surgery.","Out-patient surgery volumes were down 1.7% in total. Hospital based out-patient surgeries were down 1.3% and inside our ambulatory surgery division, out-patient surgeries were down 2.2%.","Out-patient endoscopic and pain management procedures which are not included in our surgery statistics increased 5% for the quarter.","Other in-patient volume statistics for the company were as follows: obstetric admissions were up 2.1% as part of this growth, managed care of obstetric admissions were up 4%. Behavioural Health admissions grew by 2.4% and rehabilitation admissions grew by 7% and finally average length of stay for in-patient admissions increased 0.9%, reflecting the stronger acuity.","Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended September 2013. Once again this data is the most current data available for the company and it represents approximately 90% of the company's markets.","The company's in-patient market share for this period grew 31 basis points to 24.1%. HCA gained share in 25 out of 37 markets with gains in 8 of our top 10 markets. We gained share in 12 out of 17 service lines and market share in the commercial segment was flat and also in the in-migration segment we actually increased by 31 basis points.","Overall during this period in-patient demand across HCA markets was essentially flat. However in three of the four quarters in this period demand actually increased, but this growth was entirely offset by the soft demand in the first quarter of 2013. Across all of these market share metrics the company's trends are generally consistent with past periods. We believe this performance reflects both solid execution of our growth and operating agendas by our management team and increased capital investments in capacity, technology and new facilities.","And with that I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor Campbell","All right, Sam, thank you. Travis you want to come back on and queue up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question today from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","","Operator","Being as there is no response, we'll move onto our next question. Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Good morning. I was hoping if you could give us a little bit of color on the progression of volumes in the quarter and really in the first quarter and really how your stat going into the second quarter given this volatility that you called out. And then secondly, I know Milton had commented in the past that he would never use weather as an excuse. I'm just curious what was the weather impact in the quarter? Thank you.","Victor Campbell","","Milton, you want to do weather and do you want Sam to answer that.","Milton Johnson","Yeah, Frank, we're going to stand by my earlier statement. We don't believe, we didn't see, you know weather of course did hit some of the timing of some of our services in certain markets in the quarter, but we believe the timing of the weather issues were such in the quarter that we were able to largely recover, no material identifiable impact from weather in our first quarter.","Victor Campbell","Sam, you want to talk about the progression in the quarter.","Sam Hazen","The admission growth for the company was primarily in February and March. We actually were up in both of those two months. As the quarter progressed all of our pressure points were in the month of January, which was when we compared against the flu volume from last year. And so if you look at the last two months we did have admission growth and adjusted admission growth as the quarter progressed.","Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird","","Hey thanks, maybe just one for Bill or one now that you guys have a better glimpse at a lot of the enrolment data in your markets recognizing that it's a small piece right now. But any unique observations that you think are worth making and my second question would just be around the conversation around premium subsidies and I'm not sure if HCA has just really stated their position at this point. So just any comments there will be helpful.","William Rutherford","","Well I can't call out any distinct characteristics with this exchange volume so far in the first quarter. You know it is still early. As I mentioned in my comments we're pleased with the progression of that volume we saw in the first quarter, seems to be fairly even spread among a majority of our states. Really no differentiating characteristics of that exchange volume compared to our other book of business at this stage, so nothing really to call out right now.","Milton Johnson","","And on the premium subsidy, I think there we have, we have not really pursued that.","William Rutherford","Yeah, our position is when we have not pursued premium subsidies in a large scale way. We may still reserve the opportunity to do that on a case by case basis. But for the most part we're not pursuing a strategy around premium subsidies.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Thanks, good morning everybody. You know I just wanted to follow-up with regard to some of your comments Bill, about the growth in the indigent receivables and I just want to make sure that I understand what really that reflects, and if you could also please remind us what the Medicaid pending policy is for HCA, it would seem that even though you don't have a lot of Medicaid expansion exposure, there has been a decent amount of wood work effect. So curious if that's tying up any receivables and how you think that might play out into the next couple of quarters.","William Rutherford","In my comments around working capital and cash flow we attributed to a couple of items and I did reference in indigent program receivable. That\u2019s in one of our states where we make contributions to a fund and then we receive indigent payments back out. It\u2019s just timing differences and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s really a material factor. We did have a growth in government receivables mainly just through increased complexity of that collection cycle with regulatory environment and we think that will eventually find its course.","Relative to pending Medicaid, we have kept our pending Medicaid policies consistent as uninsured patients come to our facilities, we screen them for pending Medicaid eligibility, and once they get accepted within that Medicaid program, that account is treated as a Medicaid account. They don't get accepted, we then move them through our charity and uninsured discount program and our policies around that have remained consistent.","Sam Hazen","Yes. As you may know, we look at our prior right off history and use that as the basis for our estimates going forward.","Operator","We will take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup","Just had a question going back to your thoughts on the HCA and I certainly heard what you said about the trends and how you feel about it going forward. When you guys gave your guidance for the year, I think nationally you maybe 1.8 million people had signed up for exchanges and now of course we know the number is 8 million or more than 8 million. Still some question as to what percentage of those were previously uninsured, but I just wondered how much that substantial acceleration enrollment has impacted how you're thinking about the go forward particularly in states like Texas and Florida where exchange enrollment has picked up pretty significantly.","Milton Johnson","Yes, Gary when we ran our models we had \u2013 actually the data was more current than 1.8 million, that was probably around 3 million or so when we had projections that it would go higher up. So our assumption was not the 8 million people to be enrolled in this first year. That's a little higher than we thought. And we will see how that plays out in the rest of the year. But again, what we saw here in the first quarter and as Bill said and I will say again, it's too early to take a lot out of the first quarter as an indication of health care reform for the rest of the year and I said on the call last quarter that we probably wouldn't be able to provide a lot or thought about reform until at least the middle of the year when we release second quarter. I think we still reserve that position.","With that being said, the 8 million enrolled is more than we thought in our model, but how we thought about reform and the potential impact it would have in the first quarter, the actual results are fairly consistent with what we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","We had a little medical urgency on this end. I apologize for missing my queue at first. Can you comment on the way you approach the accounting for Medicaid pending and whether it\u2019s different with some of the commentary referred, for example, from light point about how they do it? And also can you comment about your expectations for acquisition strategy for this year and the coming years? Thanks.","Victor Campbell","Bill, you want to do the\u2026","William Rutherford","","Yeah. Sure. All of yours pending Medicaid moment you want on the acquisition. Sure, we did talk about it briefly. Our policies around pending Medicaid have not changed. It\u2019s consistent with the way we\u2019ve operated that for several years as patients come into our facilities of unsure, we put them on pending Medicaid status and go through an eligibility review screening. When that individual gets accepted into that state\u2019s Medicaid program we would then convert them out of pending Medicaid into Medicaid and told them they attract this pending Medicaid. If they don\u2019t get involved in a Medicaid, they may move through our charity and on into our discount policy. So, no change in how we treat those. Our accounting methodology is to reserve for that pending Medicaid based on our historical experience and again we\u2019ve had no material changes in how we approach that segment of our business.","Victor Campbell","","Bill, if you want to add a bit.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","You don\u2019t account for the self-pay in the current reported revenues but rather as Medicaid but reduce in terms of less than 100% of what you expect to get up there approved as a member.","William Rutherford","","Yeah. If the pending Medicaid attracts in self-pay until which time they get accepted in the Medicaid, so the pending Medicaid is attracting a self-pay. We do not classify them as Medicaid until they\u2019re accepted as a Medicaid alone for that state. So, in this interim revenue period they\u2019re attracting a self-pay receivables into self-pay revenues for us.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","","That\u2019s important thing. Thank you.","William Rutherford","","Okay. Sheryl relative to acquisition strategy remains consistent while we\u2019ve been the last really few years. So I would say many times we would like to be able to grow through more meaningful acquisitions if we can find those opportunities that set our strategy in terms of what the market complexion will look like and our belief of how we could drive shareholder value through those acquisitions. So, that hasn\u2019t changed. If you look over the last few years, our acquisitions have been largely what I called \u201ctuck-in acquisitions.\u201d Those have been successful acquisitions for the company, we\u2019ll continue to pursue that. But given the opportunity to make a more material acquisition in the market, we would look at those opportunities and we do look at those opportunities. Some of the larger transactions that have occurred in last couple of years have largely been raw sort of facilities and really didn\u2019t fit the sort of markets that we looked for. So, those we did not pursue obviously. But I would say it\u2019s a consistent acquisition strategy. We continue to look for opportunities and hope for that we\u2019ll be able to find opportunities to grow inorganic growth through acquisitions that are we have pricing discipline but will also result in creating shareholder value.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","","Thank you. So\u2026","Victor Campbell","","Thank you, Sheryl. I\u2019m sorry.","Sheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital","Yeah. Okay, if I could just follow up on that. When you did Kansas City it was slightly accretive to the first year. I recognize the things in history because it was over 10 years ago, but it was slightly dilutive to the first year but heavily accretive after that, a very important acquisition. Would you consider doing something like that again if that meant meaningful step-up in the company\u2019s growth profile?","Milton Johnson","","We would \u2013 I think Sheryl that many times when we see acquisitions coming of not for profit sector, not always, but sometimes can be assets that are challenged. That was the case in Kansas City. And so it was a turnaround situation that\u2019s been almost I guess now 14-13 years ago and it was a successful turnaround for us, but we knew that we will walk into a turnaround situation. There could be acquisitions, though that we could see a not for profit sector where it could be a motivation to look for strategic opportunities in the market not because of financial issues but because of the changing market place and these institutions could see the advantage as a being part of a large organization. I get to see what we could bring to the table, and we\u2019re hoping we will find more those opportunities as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions just on Medicaid expansion. First, when your peers give an estimate that 80% of their uninsured volumes come from people who are Medicaid eligible, do you have an estimate here for HCA? And then what are your typical approval trends on Medicaid admissions? And has that changed post the implementation of presumed eligibility? Thanks.","Victor Campbell","","Bill. Sounds like you..","William Rutherford","Yeah. Justin. Hi, good morning. I honestly don\u2019t have a strong percentage for you on our uninsured that\u2019s Medicaid eligible. My instinct says it\u2019s a higher percentage, but I can quote a percentage for you. We are seeing in our expansion states as we mentioned some really higher that shifts that may re-anticipate in terms of the uninsured to Medicaid so that may support it. It\u2019s a higher percent, but I can\u2019t throw out a percent for you at this point in time relative to the impact on Medicaid conversions. So, when I walk through pending Medicaid and when we go through the screening then that individuals determine to be qualified for that state\u2019s Medicaid. We got a very high percentage of converting them into Medicaid north of the 80% are. When you don\u2019t, it\u2019s generally issues where just obtaining signatures and application process; so very, very high.","Too early to call changes in that with our 4-expansion states. We have seen a growth in our pending Medicaid in those states, which I.V. [ph] was a positive sign as we have more people in the queue. We do have some increased success rate of converting those in this first quarter, and I think we\u2019ll need another quarter or so for that to settle out as we have not only the existing inventory going through pending Medicaid but new service states since January on there. So, we\u2019re all optimistic we\u2019ll see that conversion go even higher in our expansion stage.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, Justin.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks.","Operator","","Our next questions comes from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi, good morning. I\u2019m just curious are you seeing any trends of -- exchange members showing up at ERs? And if you are a kind of rates you\u2019re collecting from managed care for this client? Thanks.","William Rutherford","","Yeah. Good morning. The majority of our exchange volume is in network. We do have some out at network and when we do have that out at network it is showing up an EV, but the majority of the exchange volume is in network and it\u2019s too early to call kind of the adjudication rates on either one of -- out of network population.","Victor Campbell","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jason Gurda with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gurda \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing as far as narrow network contracting what sort of changes year-over-year then also managed care plans in use of tiered hospital networks?","Victor Campbell","Right. Sam, you want to lead with that?","Sam Hazen","","Most of the narrow networks are contracts that are visible inside the markets are related to exchange products and exchange products only. 88 participate in about 99% of all commercial contracts across all 42 markets that are participates in and we\u2019ve participated in our governmental Medicare advantage or managed Medicaid products. Generally speaking, we\u2019re not seeing any kind of changes in our contracting configuration with the payors in the cycle that we\u2019re in today and that cycle includes 2014 and 2015 where we have all the revenue for the most part in 2014 contracted at about 70% of our 2015 revenue contracted at similar terms and trends. 2016 is about a third done and again it\u2019s very similar to what we have seen in the earlier part of its cycle. So, no material changes other than we\u2019ve experienced in the past and the only new dynamic is within the exchanges. Jason, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Thank you for taking the call. On just want to make sure I understand the admission numbers that you\u2019d talked about with respect to Medicaid, I think you said 22.3% growth in Medicaid in your expansion state with the corresponding decline in uninsured of 29%. So within that does that include Medicaid pendings or if the Medicaid pendings actually do come through then the growth in cat would be higher and uninsured would be lower? Or is there some estimate at that a conversion rate of those\u2026?","Sam Hazen","","No. There\u2019s no estimate. The Medicaid would only include those that are actually enrolled in Medicaid and pending Medicaid would be still treated as uninsured. So, there\u2019s no estimate of conversion in pending Medicaid, and I\u2019ll report that the Medicaid admissions in those expansions they show all four individuals that were actually enrolled in Medicaid to the extent they\u2019re still pursuing enrolment, we\u2019re going to the application, those are treated as uninsured in our accounting. So, the odds are overtime that\u2026","William Rutherford","And as I said we\u2019re seeing some increased balances in our pending Medicaid in those conversion states. So, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll see more come out of that in the future. Good?","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Right. And is there a way to size the pending Medicaid bucket right now in terms of the total percentage of admits in those states?","William Rutherford","No. It\u2019s still too early to be able to kind of size what we think that changes in our historical experience will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","","Joanna Gajuk \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually this is Joanna Gajuk in for Kevin today. Thanks a lot for the call in terms of the reform, but I want to just come back quickly on the volume performance in the quarter, which did improve and you guys did find to keep \u2013 don\u2019t want to blame weather. You said you expect or you did \u2013 the volumes came back to you, but previously you were also talking about impact of 2-Midnight Rules. So, can you talk about that whether there was any impact this quarter and how this compare to Q4 and then going forward and also your fear how sort of company talk about that\u2019s improving economy benefits in the quarter on the while? So, any color you might give on those? I do appreciate. Thanks.","William Rutherford","","Yeah. I would try to address pieces of that as the 2-Midnight Rule and we mentioned that in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re still implementing the 2-Midnight Rule and dedicating a lot of resources towards that effort. As mentioned in our commentary, we are experiencing softness of one day stays among all payor classes. And we did have a decline in Medicare 1 stays for the quarter. It\u2019s not as pronounced as we had in the first quarter. We still have many..","In the fourth quarter. Sorry. Then I said last year. So, we did have an impact in the first quarter, but it was not pronounced as we had in the fourth quarter of \u201913. We still have accounts going through the review process. We\u2019re working with our external reviewers on probe reviews that are going still refining processes on that. And so we\u2019ll still have our ongoing implementation efforts. We do think it will continue to impact some of our admission statistics going forward but does not have a material financial impact on us as we\u2019ve spoken about before because we\u2019ve been able to eliminate some outside revenue of this and Sam\u2019s going to address the economic side of it.","Sam Hazen","","Yeah. I don\u2019t know. But I have a metric per se that indicates a composite view of the company\u2019s economies but I\u2019ll say that in general the unemployment rates across HCA markets is better than the unemployment rate at the nation as a whole. It\u2019s trending favorably also. And then if I would put a proxy [ph] on a particular measure that suggests possible improvement, it would be the managed care delivery for the company, about 4% in the first quarter. And that\u2019s a positive indicator of my opinion about the economy across HCA markets and what it might portend as we move forward.","Victor Campbell","","Good. Thank you, Joanna","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Gimmerman with [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just as a follow-up to the acquisition question, can you give us an update on how you\u2019re viewing the possibility of further international expansion? And then can you give us an update on the amount of target in repurchases at this point? It looks like you\u2019ve taken measures in last quarter in terms of refinancing to ease the ability to buy back. So, just a general update on your appetite for a larger purchase.","Victor Campbell","Bill, that sounds like one for you.","William Rutherford","","You know as far as acquisition opportunists internationally we\u2019ve done our assessment of international markets, which markets do we find to be attractive in the event of\u2026 We see any opportunity. We did have that across the U.S. markets as well. So, we obviously operate in the U.K. in London very successful market for us. So, we have some experience there. But other than that, there is really nothing more thing to add to how we do to international markets. It\u2019s we access it much like we do in the U.S. markets. With respect to the \u2013 I think referring to restricted payments basket, the restructuring that we went through are debt structuring deed, increase of restricted payments basket.","Victor Campbell","","And do you want\u2026?","William Rutherford","Yeah. Right now before we talk our plans we have just about $1 billion of capacity under the restricted balance, restricted payments basket and it will increase once we follow first quarter compliance by a couple $100 million.","Unidentified Analyst","","Alright. Thanks a lot.","William Rutherford","Okay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.","Victor Campbell","","Hi Chris.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International Group.","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to better understand the comments around the comparisons getting more difficult in Q2 or just the latter part of the area. Is that just volumes or you\u2019re saying year-to-year growth in EBITDA and EPS as well.","William Rutherford","Well. What I was referring to as we went through the last year we had a really solid performance in the second quarter. And actually if you look back at 2013 in the second quarter, we had the highest admission growth of the year in the second quarter. So it will be a difficult comp I think relative to the growth in volume and in turn, that will also to a difficult comp in the first quarter is what I'm trying to say then as well. So I just wanted to point that out to the market. If you look at our guidance for the year in the first quarter, our growth rate exceeded our guidance for the year and I just wanted to point out that as we think about the second quarter and our performance in the second quarter of last year, that needs to be considered as you're looking at the growth rate. So obviously our guidance does not project that the growth rate we produced in the first quarter will continue throughout the rest of the year. That's the point really I was trying to make.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe give us any early read on success you may have had on getting insured covered via the exchange maybe how aggressive you were there? And is there any way to think about sort of a potential kind of pending bucket for that category in terms of kind of coming back into the facility frequent flyers, et cetera.","William Rutherford","So as we spoke about in fourth quarter, we made attempts on outreach to our insured both our certified application account for us in our facilities about 400 of them making contact, we also in early in this quarter, we made outbound kind of contact to what we view the people who have visited our system frequently over the past 12 months. And I would say the result of that on this was fairly marginal, it was more of an education and awareness campaign as much as anything versus how to track the exact number of sign ups or applications that generated. But we are fairly active in that but in terms of the yielded result hard to track exactly in terms of how much, how many exchange enrollments that resulted in, it was more of a community education and awareness effort.","Operator","Our next question comes from HA Rice with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Just two quick things. First of all, I guess we\u2019ve got an IPAPS update coming and you are rolling of a sequestration, can you remind us how much you benefit, how much the sequestration is a quarterly drag for you has been and do you have any views on the IPAPS proposals coming out and then \u2013 is there any update on some of the initiatives in parallel [ph]?","Milton Johnson","On the sequestration hit in the quarter, I think it\u2019s about 35 million to 40 million drag for us year over year. Of course that normalizes out and we did that sequestration drag of course in our plan but that\u2019s the dollar amount of the drag.","Victor Campbell","Yes, we are sitting there just like you, we expect it one day this week and really can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s going to include, we\u2019re not getting any signals of surprises but time will tell.","William Rutherford","This is Bill on Parallon, I think we are on plan with Parallon growth, continue to focus with the implementation of the LifePoint account as we have heard about, we got our Catholic Healthcare Partners implementation going on as we speak and so far Parallon is on plan with our expectation. Our health thrust purchasing group inside Parallon is performing very well as well.","Operator","We will take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. I guess one clarification. Just to be clear based on the analysis that you had done of the exchange based patients, so two thirds of the exchange individuals have not been previously insured, is that the takeaway from that?","William Rutherford","No. It was the opposite. So we look at our exchange volume, went back 12 month and said how we\u2019d seen them before, and we have seen about half of that volume previously. And of that half, one third was previously uninsured, two thirds had some previous coverage. So that number was one third at least of that data point previously had no coverage, but to date they are enrolled in exchange product.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","So was that in line with your expectations or was that surprising to you?","William Rutherford","It\u2019s pretty close to what our expectations were. I think as we spoke in our earlier call, that was a variable that was floating around as we were completing our model about how much of your exchange volume that you projected will be incremental or not and there were numbers all over from 11% to 50% and we say kind of our numbers were in the middle of that. So that\u2019s really consistent with what our model expectations would be.","Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo","And just on sort of the progression of the rate of increase of the impact from the exchanges sort of the doubling in February and March, do you expect that kind of rate of increase to continue through say mid May when the impact of those that were signing up on the exchanges had sort of \u2013 how would you think about that?","William Rutherford","We are hopeful but my honest answer is we just don\u2019t know yet, so we are continuing to watch that, we think there will be some progression of that, will it be at the same pace we saw in the first couple of months, really I just don\u2019t know, it would be great if it was but we just don\u2019t know yet.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Collin Lange [ph] with FBR Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a quick one following up on a few earlier questions. Are you still comfortable with 1% to 2% equivalent admission growth for the year given the comps do get a bit more difficult in Q2 and Q3?","Milton Johnson","We are starting here just at admissions that down 0.3 here for the first quarter. I wouldn\u2019t take 1% growth off the table yet but so I would say still one to two would be our best guidance based on one quarter.","Victor Campbell","All right. Thank you, Collin, thank everyone for participating on the call. And Mark is here all day and I will be here part of the day.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"11020":["HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) Q2 2018 Earnings Call July 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","R.

Please note that this call is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I'd like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's second quarter earnings release. A replay of this call will become available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. We were very pleased with the second quarter's results. Revenue growth driven by solid volume and rate growth combined with good expense management provided strong adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of a solid adjusted EBITDA growth for the company.","Starting in the fourth quarter of 2017, we have reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.1%, 5.6% and 6.6% on a quarterly basis. In our earnings release this morning, we announced revised earnings guidance, reflecting higher earnings expectations for full year 2018, more on this later in my comments.","Revenues in the second quarter totaled $11.529 billion, up 7.4% from the previous year's second quarter. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $820 million or $2.31 per diluted share compared to $657 million or $1.75 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare increased 24.9% and diluted earnings per share increased 32% compared to the previous year's second quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.227 billion, an increase of 6.6% from the previous year's $2.09 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA growth rate was unfavorably impacted 4.4% by the sale of the Oklahoma University assets in Q1 and the results of recent hospital acquisitions. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.345 billion compared to $4.095 billion, an increase of 6.1%.","Volume trends were solid for the second quarter with our reported admissions increasing 4.5% and equivalent admissions increasing 5.1% over the prior year period. Same-facility admissions increased 2.7%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 2.8% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2017.","I was particularly pleased to see our same-facility managed care and exchange adjusted admissions increase 1.9% in the second quarter. The highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2016.","Cash flows from operations remain strong at $1.582 billion compared to $1.404 billion last year. We maintained a balanced approach to investing and capital expenditures in our existing markets, while returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. We invested $880 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2018, repurchased 4.7 million shares at a cost of $470 million, and also paid a dividend of $122 million during the quarter.","During the first six months of 2018, the company has placed in service approximately $625 million in growth capital, adding access points and new capacity to our networks. Estimated growth capital coming online for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $825 million. Capital expenditure investment is a key component of our strategy and we believe it will provide continued opportunities for growth in our markets.","This morning, we updated the company's 2018 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance of the company through June 30, 2018. We increased our estimated revenues, adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share ranges for the year. Revenues are now projected to range from $45.5 billion to $46.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA is estimated to range from $8.65 billion to $8.85 billion and diluted earnings per share is now estimated to range from $9 to $9.40 per diluted share.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to take a moment to mention our company's 50th anniversary, which we'll officially celebrate next month. Since our incorporation in August of 1968, HCA Healthcare has grown from a single hospital, Park View Hospital located in Nashville, to what it is today, a healthcare company with close to 2,000 sites of care, 38,000 active physicians, approximately 250,000 employees, more than 28 million annual patient encounters and an enterprise valuation in excess of $70 billion.","I'm not sure of our founders, Dr. Frist, Sr., Dr. Frist, Jr., and Jack Massey could have anticipated the impact of the company they launched with that one hospital 50 years ago. We thank them for their original vision and a legacy of commitment to the practice and delivery of healthcare.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bill for more information on the quarter.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter, starting with volume results by payer class.","During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11% on a same-facility basis and represented 37% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions increased 1.6%, while equivalent admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 7.8% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 6.5%. These represented 8% of our total admissions compared to 7.6% in the prior year period. Texas and Florida represented about 70% of our total uninsured admissions.","Managed care and exchange admissions increased 0.9% and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Both are an increase from our recent results. Same-facility emergency room visits declined 0.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.9% of our total ER visits in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 19.3% in the prior year period.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 2.3% in the quarter with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.7% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.6% from the prior year period. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.6% in the quarter, which reflects continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter.","Our hospital-only same-facility managed care and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, same-facility hospital-only managed care and exchange revenue per equivalent admission has increased 5%.","Our same-facility total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care and uninsured discounts, totaled $6.057 billion in the quarter as compared to $5.397 billion reported in the prior year. This growth is in line with our volume and pricing results.","So let me take a minute to discuss the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.6% in the quarter was negatively impacted by our acquisitions and divestitures. We closed on the divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities on February 1 of this year. This negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 210 basis points in the quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the impact of our new facilities, which primarily consist of our hospital acquisitions that occurred in 2017 and the first half of 2018, negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 230 basis points in the quarter.","Now turning to expenses and operating margins. Our as reported EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points from 19.5% in the second quarter last year to 19.3% on an as reported basis. The sale of our Oklahoma facilities and our new facilities, which primarily consist of recent acquisitions, had 130 basis points unfavorable impact on our EBITDA margin for the second quarter of 2018. Our same-facility EBITDA margins increased approximately 90 basis points over the prior year.","Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.3% compared to last year's second quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues were 45.8% compared to 45.6% in last year's second quarter. On a same-facility basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 42.4% versus 42.9% last year and same-facility salaries per equivalent admissions increased 2.3% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable.","Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.6% this quarter compared to 16.7% in last year's second quarter on a consolidated basis. On a same-facility basis, supplies as a percent of revenue declined 20 basis points and same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Other operating expenses increased 10 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.4% of revenues. On a same-facility basis, other operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined 20 basis points from the prior year and increased 2% on a per equivalent basis.","So let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations increased 12.7% in the quarter to $1.582 billion compared to $1.404 billion in last year's second quarter. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.582 billion, less capital expenditures of $880 million, distributions to non-controlling interest of $93 billion (sic) [$93 million] and dividends paid to shareholders of $122 million was $487 million in the quarter compared to $568 million in Q2 of 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.842 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.91 times at June 30, 2018 compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017.","Moving on to earnings per share, our earnings per share increased 32% in the quarter to $2.31, up from $1.75 in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned in our release, earnings per share was favorably impacted in the quarter by $0.34 due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also, we estimate our divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities, coupled with the impact of our new facilities, had approximately $0.18 negative impact on earnings per share in the quarter as compared to the prior year.","So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Good morning to everybody. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. In general, our volume growth accelerated in the quarter and was broad-based across the company's divisions. My comments will focus on our same-facility's domestic operations.","12 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in six divisions: North Texas, Gulf Coast, North Florida, San Antonio, Central Texas and South Atlantic divisions. Our East Florida and Mountain divisions conversely were down. 12 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, five divisions had growth in emergency room visits, freestanding emergency room visits grew 14%, while hospital-based emergency room visits declined 2.5%. Once again, higher acuity visits grew, while lower acuity visits declined.","Medicaid emergency room visits were down 4.8%, which explain the overall decline in emergency room visits. Admissions through emergency room grew by 3.4%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 3.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 2%. Surgical admissions were 27.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which is generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular, vascular and orthopedic service lines. Eight divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries showed strong growth also. Hospital-based surgeries were up 3.5% and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers were up 1.5%. 12 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries.","Behavioral health admissions grew 3%. Rehab admissions grew 7.4%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 2.5%. Births were up 0.4%. Neonatal admissions were down slightly at 0.6%, however, neonatal patient days were up 1.8%, an indication of higher level of acuity in these units. Urgent care visits for the company were down 3.6% on a same-facility basis, but they were up 12% in total.","HCA has now grown same-facility admissions in 17 consecutive quarters. We believe this consistent pattern of growth is a result of positive macro factors in our markets and a comprehensive growth agenda that is both well-resourced and well executed.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Sam. All right. Kathy, if you'd like to come back on and poll for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We will go first to A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everyone, and congratulations on the 50th anniversary. I just want to drill down maybe a little bit more on the volumes that you're seeing. I know two or three years ago, the company stepped up the pace of capital spending. I assume that that would be part of the strength you're seeing. Is there any way to delineate that out? And I think, Sam, you mentioned in your comments about the strength in the underlying markets. I know you often talk about being in markets that are growing faster than the overall national average. Is there any way to say has there been in the recent quarters a pickup in the underlying volume trends in your mind, either in your markets or nationally, that's supplementing your growth or is this mostly company specific?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","A.J., thank you. And Sam, do you, well, want to take that to start?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, let me give a little backdrop here first. If you look at 2017, we indicated throughout the year that we believe that the markets that we were in had strong fundamentals and they would ultimately show themselves. They don't show themselves in every year consecutively, as we've mentioned, but nonetheless, they do show themselves. And what we saw in 2017 was moderate demand growth in the first three quarters of the year across all of HCA's markets. But in the fourth quarter, we started to see some elevation in overall demand growth within our markets. It stepped up to almost 1.8%. We don't have the first quarter of 2018, nor the second quarter yet, but it is our belief that the fundamentals within our market are, in fact, strong, as we've mentioned, historically. We think as we look forward that the demand growth is somewhere between 2% and 2.5% across HCA's markets over the next intermediate run.","Having said that, we do think our strategies, our capital deployment, our physician engagement and other components of our growth strategy are showing themselves very competitively in the marketplace. And that's part of what we see as contributing to our growth. The capital that we have deployed has come online, and in the individual facilities, most of them are performing as we expected with the new capital. I don't know that it's enough yet to fully indicate that that's what's driving our lift, but I think it is a contributing factor, A.J. And it's just hard for me to sit here and quantify it specifically and say that's driving X amount of growth.","But I think, overall, when you look across the different components that we just mentioned, we had pretty much every service line indicator show positive growth, except for the emergency room visits, and that was down slightly. Again, it was down in the categories of our business that are the least profitable, our low acuity business and our Medicaid business. So it didn't have an effect, really, on our revenue stream, nor our profitability.","But we remain optimistic about our markets and the macro factors, as I indicated. And then, we believe we're doing the right thing to build out our provider system capabilities, improve our service offerings, improve our quality and engagement with our constituents. And we think it's yielding a pretty positive result for the company.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. A.J., maybe just to add, again, on macro, I guess, viewpoint here. Last Friday, the Department of Labor released their annual survey, and it was interesting. We've been saying as a company looking \u2013 and especially with our markets, that we're seeing a growth in the number of lives covered by employer-sponsored insurance. And we believe that that macro sooner or later will start to show up in our numbers. And I said we had the highest managed care exchange volumes this quarter that we've seen since really going back to 2016.","But interesting in this survey, again, and this is national information, unemployment rates fell in June to 4%, its lowest rate I think in 18 years. And in our markets, our unemployment rates are lower than 4%. Like Nashville, for example, I think the unemployment rate is 2.2%. But more importantly, because of the tighter labor market, this survey indicated that businesses are offering more generous benefits as a result and most importantly for us, more employer-sponsored health insurance.","And so we've been seeing that growth in large employers, but what this survey indicated, now even smaller employers, employers with businesses with 50 to 500 workers, are now offering a greater share of their employees than the year before offering health insurance. So, again, these macro trends, I think, are playing well for us, not only this \u2013 what I quoted are national statistics, but our markets are performing even better than the national average is. So, again, I think this macro is a favorable indication for us as well.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you, A.J.","Operator","We will now go to Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Well, in addition to the strong organic growth, I guess I'll ask about the external growth. I know you've made a number of acquisitions like Savannah, and you have a pending acquisition, Mission Health. Just curious, would like an update on kind of how you see those developing, ones you've already closed, plus the ones that may be pending. And then, any comments on what you might see from a 340B update. I know there's a lot going on out there. Does that have any concerns to you? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Sam, do you want to take the update (24:11) part of that?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","So, let me break our acquisitions down into really three components, Frank. 2017 acquisitions that we did mainly in Texas, and then we have the Savannah acquisition that we did in the first quarter of 2018, and then we're in the due diligence process with Mission, so there's really not a whole lot to report there, other than the fact that we think the diligence process is going well. We continue to be very impressed by the Mission Health System and believe it's a logical acquisition opportunity for HCA, given our strategy and our disciplined approach to acquiring hospitals.","Our Texas hospital acquisitions have been a bit of a disappointment, as we've indicated. Over the past six to eight months, we did not accomplish what we thought we would accomplish in the first year. We do believe, however, that we're starting to turn the corner on the operations in those particular facilities and that we believe long-term we made the right decision in adding to our portfolio in Houston. Houston is a large market. We have significant market share and the geographical positioning of these hospitals we believe over the long run will continue to support our network and provide a very reasonable return for the company.","Savannah, as we indicated, is a long-term play for us. Savannah, coming out of the gate, is about where we thought it was. We knew it was a struggling institution when we acquired it, but it has really strong fundamentals when it comes to the services that it offers in a very tight CON state like Georgia, the kind of quality physicians and great nursing that it has. It just needs the right leadership, the right resources and the right strategy. And we think over a three to five year period, we're going to be in a really solid position with that particular facility.","So, acquisitions continue to play a part of our network development. We've added some outpatient facilities here and there, some physician clinics, one of which that was sizable in Austin, Texas that supported our network there. So we continue to do these tuck-ins. We have, over the last year, as you know here, added a few hospitals, and we'll continue to look for those as they surface. And as long as they make sense strategically and financially, we will pursue them with the same kind of disciplined approach we had in the past. On the 340B, Vic, you want to do that one?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I'll take that. Thanks. Frank, I think you're aware and most are aware that HCA and investor-owned hospitals are not eligible for 340B funding. So, obviously, there's a lot of talk about 340B and changes to it and what have you, but those really, at this point, we would not see impacting us or the other investor-owned companies.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess if they went back and changed something, I know it actually was a benefit in your guidance for Medicare rates, but what I was saying was just any fears if they were to come back and change it, would they come claw back and would it \u2013 it might have a negative impact on you, if they were to reverse something?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","That's a fair question. Yes, when they did do the reduction in payments to 340Bs effective January 1, they put those reductions back into the base for all hospitals. And to be perfectly honest, if you look at roughly 3,000 hospitals in this country, there are about 500 hospitals that were part of the 340B program, about 560, that then ended up with a little less in 340B payment. All the rest, including investor-owns and all the other non-profits benefited by that redistribution. So it is there. It's not a huge number, but it is part of our reimbursement. If there was a change and they went back on it, obviously, it would be some impact, but relatively immaterial. And obviously, we're watching that. We don't really see any indication of that happening.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Our next question will come from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning. It looks like preliminary Medicare rates for 2019 came in pretty strong, both in terms of the IPPS rate and the change in DSH. Was hoping you could size the potential impact here if these rates are finalized in August. And did you embed anything into the guidance update for Q4 as these things roll on? And then also, wanted to follow up on your comments on acquired facilities. Looks like they've lost about $75 million in EBITDA year-to-date. So, I was just curious in terms of your view of performance built into guidance for the second half. Do you think they lose something similar? And then, do you think you can get to breakeven or even a positive contribution in 2019? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. I'll do the Medicare rate and then I think Bill will talk about the acquisition number. Justin, our position as a company is we really don't discuss that until we see final rules. So we still haven't seen the final inpatient rule, nor have they actually published the proposed outpatient rule, which should be coming shortly. Now having said all of that, the early indications are that our rate increase coming in October 1 of this year would be better than most previous years we've seen for a while, but we're going to hang there until we see final rules before we try to quantify it in any way.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, and Justin, this is Bill. Embedded in our guidance on that is pretty much just our trends continuing on and so we'll wait for the final rule. Relative to the acquisitions, as Sam mentioned, we do anticipate improved performance in our recent acquisitions, but they still will be a year-over-year headwind for us in the back half of the year. In terms of our plans to get them to breakeven by 2019, I think each of them have a little different unique story, as Sam indicated, but I think our plans would be that they should be able to be a growth vehicle for us going forward and be a breakeven or better going forward.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Justin.","Operator","We will now go to Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the \u2013 I appreciate all the information that you gave in terms of the backdrop for the higher volumes we're seeing. And I'm not taking anything away, of course, from your own execution, which I'm sure is an integral part of that. But my question is, have you followed or believed in any sort of model that is correlated with the economy? We followed that for a long time and I'll tell you, sort of pointed to a three to five year lag that we didn't see in any dramatic fashion but maybe we are now. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Milton?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, obviously, not recently, but a couple of years \u2013 few years ago, we did do a study looking at the effect of the economy on healthcare spending and healthcare volumes. And what we found \u2013 we did see our study revealed a lag. If my memory's correct, it was probably an 18 to 24 month lag between when an economy started increasing before we started seeing the upside from that. And likewise, when there's a downturn, we tend to have 18 to 24 months of reasonable \u2013 of trends (31:56) before we see the impact. So, again, that study we did is somewhat dated, but it did conclude that we should expect a lag between business trends in volumes as far as volumes in our sector and the movement of the economy.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Matt.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Citigroup.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. You strung together several quarters of acuity up over 4%, and I know you said you expect more like 2% to 3%. Any update on thoughts of sort of sustainability around that? And then just a second piece somewhat related to surgery, seemed like a little bit of a turnaround there, one of the better quarters we've seen in a while. Just anything to sort of call out within specific service lines, both inpatient, outpatient? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Ralph. Sam, sounds like yours.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, I think on the case mix, if you look back at 2016, we were about 3% \u2013 north of 3%. 2017, north of 3%. The first half of 2017, north of 4%. So, we have seen some acceleration in our case mix. Some of that we think is a result of programmatic development in key service lines, whether it's trauma, cardiovascular, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and oncology, all of these things are playing a part, so it's difficult to point to any one of them.","Some of our clinical initiatives, I will tell you, are also contributing to case mix growth. As we get better at identifying and supporting certain clinical requirements of our patients, that's also contributing somewhat to the case mix growth. I think fundamentally what you have at some level is the fact that lower acuity business is exiting in many instances to the outpatient environment that's lifting the composite inpatient case mix somewhat as well. We see that in the composition of our patient days when we look at our critical care days as a percent of total or our intermediate level days as a percent of total. So, those things do contribute.","On the outpatient surgery and the inpatient surgery, inpatient surgery continues to perform at a pretty good level. I forgot exactly how many quarters in a row we've had inpatient growth activity on the surgical side. We were really pleased with our outpatient surgical growth in the quarter. Again, we think that's a function of our physician recruitment, ambulatory surgery center development, and our OR of Choice initiative, where we're really working to deliver a great experience for our patients and a very efficient and well-equipped experience for our surgeons.","So, the combination of all those things are contributing to our trends, I think, and we continue to be optimistic with our surgical agenda. And our investments that Milton alluded to in his comments are also, I think, a part of what's happening. We continue to add capacity, we continue to upgrade the technology inside of our surgical suites, and we're seeing the benefits of that as well.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Milton, anything -","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, just on that \u2013 and to Sam's point about surgical growth, I was looking last night and this morning, and just wanted to point this out. If you look at our total surgery cases growth in the second quarter of last year, up 2.3%. That's the highest growth rate the company has reported since the first quarter of 2016. And I'll call out, too, that that was, of course, one extra day in that quarter because of leap year. Inpatient surgery cases, as Sam had mentioned, 1.7% growth this quarter. That's the highest growth rate since the second quarter of 2016. Outpatient surgery cases up 2.6% this quarter. That's the highest growth rate we've reported since the first quarter of 2016. And hospital-based outpatient surgery cases up 3.5% this quarter. That's the highest growth rate we've reported since the first quarter of 2016.","So, again \u2013 and all of these have been trending with improvement, but again, this solid performance on our surgery cases this quarter. And again, that's obviously impacting the case mix index.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Ralph.","Operator","We will now go to Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure. Just to expand on that a little bit \u2013 and by the way, happy birthday. I want to understand a little bit more about what we see going on with the managed care mix, relative \u2013 second quarter relative to the first quarter. The managed care admits were up 0.9% this quarter, same-facility basis, and up 1% in the first quarter. The equivalent admissions, however, were up 1.9% this quarter and 1.2% in the first quarter. So that seems to have accelerated. And if I look at your outpatient surgeries, that was up 2.6% overall, same-store basis, and that was down 0.5% in the first quarter. So I'm wondering, is there some kind of a rebound that we had from maybe weather in the first quarter and we're seeing some of that in the second quarter here now in the outpatient surgery side, because that could be stuff that might be more likely delayed than maybe in-patient stuff. And so I'm trying to understand, is there any rebound in this or is this all straight growth?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Sam. We did not have any significant weather issues in the first quarter and we're not viewing the second quarter results as a rebound effect from anything unusual in the first quarter. We just \u2013 we have, we think, reasonable growth initiatives in this particular category. And obviously, outpatient surgery is roughly 50% to 55% commercial business, so it has an influence on our adjusted admissions, as you indicate. And so that's a very important part of our outpatient commercial strategy, is the surgical side of things, but there's nothing unusual, at least in our analysis of our business trends, in the second quarter.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Peter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just one follow up, if you don't mind. What do you think is responsible for...","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Okay, go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","... the change from 2.6% versus the down 0.5% in the first quarter?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I'm not sure I can point to that. I think, again, there's so many factors and so many components to each of these categories, it's hard to particularly identify one thing or two things as driving it. For me, when I pull up and I look at our effort at providing great capabilities for our physicians, providing a very efficient and effective environment for our patients, the investments that we're making in technology in our surgical suites, the recruitment of surgeons, all of this adds up.","And it doesn't go in a straight line. I wish it did. It would make my life a heck of a lot easier, but it doesn't. And so, we're going to have some ups and downs, if you will, in some of these categories depending on the calendar and so forth. But, for us, we think we have a very robust and comprehensive agenda around growing surgical activities and attracting surgeons and patients to our facilities. And so we're viewing it more as a culmination of the different initiatives we've got.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, maybe I'd add one more piece of color to it. I mean, I think, too, that you're comparing the second quarter to the first quarter. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we were up almost just under 1%.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","We've seen (39:45) recent trends in our business where the fourth quarter, especially elective surgery cases, i.e. outpatient surgery cases, tend to increase in the fourth quarter as people may be trying to get in before starting new deductibles and co-pays in the upcoming year. And typically, we do see lower surgical volumes in the first quarter, I think, primarily as a result of people who can't get any things done in the fourth quarter. So I think that the 2.6% we reported compared to the first quarter, I think some of it may be explain somewhat the seasonality. But, two, I think, again, it may reflect more people with confidence in the economy coming back in and into \u2013 for healthcare services. Again, that's my speculation. But I do think when you compare it to the first quarter, that's typically a lower volume surgical \u2013 outpatient surgical quarter for us.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Peter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We will now go to Matthew Gillmore of Baird.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks for the question and congrats on 50 years. I wanted to ask about competition within your markets. HCA's obviously increased CapEx spending the last couple of years in a big way. Can you give us some insight into your local competitors? Have they responded from a CapEx perspective? Are they keeping pace or do you think the spending is creating a greater level of differentiation than prior years?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Sam, the route (41:06)?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Sam again. I think, in general, we think our spending is giving us a competitive advantage. There are specific markets where our competitors are spending at equal levels and it's not necessarily differentiating one institution from the other. Overall, it's our judgment that the competitive positioning of HCA systems across the 42 domestic markets where we do business in the states is better today than it was the same time last year because of the different elements that we judge are necessary for competitive positioning, capital being one of them. Physician satisfaction, patient satisfaction, nursing engagement, all of these components, service line development, the development of our outpatient or ambulatory footprint, all of these pieces go into assessing whether or not we are at a competitive positioning from one market to the other at an appropriate level. And it's our belief that we have incrementally year-over-year improved our competitive positioning in most of our markets. There are some very formidable competitors in HCA's markets and we have to be responsive to some of their movements, just like they respond to ours. And so, again, in general, I think our positioning is better partly due to the capital expenditures, but also partly due to these other components that are very important to overall competitive positioning.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Matthew.","Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit more on the ED, I guess, general weakness. And I'm curious it's just the one area that kind of sticks out, and I don't know, is that competition? Is that urgent care? Is there some cannibalization? Are there payer-related actions that are causing that? And then, I guess the real question on ED is like, is it actually a bad thing economically for you guys, just from an EBITDA perspective, is moving some of this volume out of the sort of high-cost emergency room into perhaps some of your recently built out outpatient facilities? Is that actually EBITDA neutral or even positive for you guys?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Josh, good question. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I think all of the factors you listed are relevant to the emergency room discussion. There are more competitors, whether it's in the same type of care in emergency room business or in substitutes potentially in urgent care. Some of our investments are potentially cannibalizing some of our business because most of the declines are in the lower \u2013 all of the declines, excuse me, are in the lower acuity levels of business.","Depending on the payer mix determines the profitability, clearly. Medicaid is not a very significant payer inside of our emergency rooms. As I indicated, our Medicare ER visits, which account for about 30% of our total visits, were down 4.8%. If you nullify that particular payer class, we were actually up in Medicare and commercial combined, and even self-pay, throw that into the mix. So I think from that standpoint, it didn't have any material effect on our profitability.","Additionally, as I indicated, our admissions through the ER were in fact up in the quarter, reflecting the higher acuity patients that we're seeing in the emergency room. Obviously, from a capital standpoint, if we lose the lower acuity, it could reduce the need for certain capital commitments down the road. But, right now, I think it's a combination of all those factors you listed. We continue to be very focused on our emergency room. Our emergency room satisfaction has grown and improved significantly over the past few years. Our throughput is remarkable. We see 9 million ER patients a year. The average time to a patient to seeing a clinician is 11 minutes. And so our continued focus on operational throughput, patient satisfaction, and in some instances, growth, will continue to be a very important part of our story. And so we have roughly 5,000 ER beds in HCA. As Milton indicated, we're adding to that because we have quite a bit of utilization. And as we see the marketplace evolve, we'll make some minor adjustments here and there. But we're very focused on having a very good emergency room service line.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Josh.","Operator","We now will take a question from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a question on your views on the ASC side of the business in terms of strategy. Do you see the need to do, say, a large-scale acquisition or make a bigger push to expand ASC business beyond what you're doing today?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, I mean, again, we're pleased with our ASC operations today. We have been selectively adding to the number of ASCs we operate. We will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to add outpatient services, especially ASCs in our business. I don't feel compelled to have to do a large acquisition which could result in us acquiring ASCs that's not in our core market. So very pleased with our strategy today and don't see a need to have to deviate from it.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Next question will come from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to focus in on the strong behavioral trends. Is HCA experiencing any headwinds such as bed closures related to staffing shortages in your psych assets? And can you talk about the labor market dynamics in psych, whether the environment around nurse shortages and wage pressure is improving or getting more difficult? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Sarah. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","We have 60 behavioral units in HCA. That's not grown on a year-over-year basis. We had the same number last year through the second quarter. There have been challenges from one facility to the other periodically around the need for psychiatrists. We have evolved a number of tactics to deal with that using telemedicine in some instances, developing graduate medical education programs that support psychiatrist development in a second instance, and so forth. So, that has surfaced periodically. We've tended to be able to overcome those. And that's why we've had, I think, a decent result.","There are some challenges in the nursing front with behavioral health nurses. It's an area where we're having to spend some time and energy in trying to create a better environment for our nurses and support our behavioral health patients. But behavioral health continues to be a very important service line for HCA. We have opportunities to invest in it. It complements our emergency room and other approaches to the business. And so we will continue to focus on it as we have in the past, and our growth, we believe, can still be in that low to mid single-digits as it's trended the first half of this year.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Sarah.","Operator","We will now go to Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Yeah, my question was about your normalized growth guidance of 4% to 6% on EBITDA, if I recall it, and on revenue as well, the 2% to 3% volume, 2% to 3% pricing. The business model seems to be working really well right now. Your competitive position's driving share gains. You're seeing pricing growth on acuity and payer mix, potentially also the margin expansion with scale and integration. And your pull through right now looks like on guidance it's above the upper end of guidance. So, when do you think you might feel comfortable raising your growth guidance?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill, do you want to -","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take that and let others add in. You're right, our long-term guidance is 4% to 6%. And we've said, I think, pretty consistently, there's going to be periods where we might be on the high end or above, and there might be periods on the lower end, but over the long run, that 4% to 6% is a good number. And I think as we've all mentioned today, we're very pleased with the results that the company's achieved, the momentum that we have competitively that Sam mentioned. You're right. On a year-to-date basis, we've got strong performance. We're at 6.1% on an as reported basis. When you normalize for our OU operations, we're pushing close to 8% on that number.","You look at our full year guidance would reflect about 6.3% at the midpoint of our revised guidance on a year-over-year basis. And when you adjust for the sale of the OU facilities and last year's hurricane impact, puts us probably close to that 6.5% to 6.6%. So we are above that 4% to 6% longer term view. And I think that is reflective of all of these positive trends and market momentums we have.","But as I started with, we've always said, there's going to be periods where we're going to be above that, maybe periods on the low end of that. So I don't think we're in a position today to think about revising that long-term numbers, but we're very optimistic about the growth trends of the company.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill, thanks. Thanks, Ana.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And now, we'll go to Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. Thanks for all the color today, and congrats on the anniversary. I guess I just wanted to sort of connect a couple dots here. It sounds like with the ER declines, coupled with really stark improvement in the surgery trends, perhaps you're seeing a pickup in elective procedures. Do you think that's a fair read? And if so, what would that suggest about sort of utilization and where you think we are in the cycle? And then sort of separate but related to that point, any comments on salary, wages and benefits? Is wage pressure, the trend rate there accelerating, or is that pretty stable still?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I think, in general \u2013 this is Sam again \u2013 the composition of our inpatient business, elective and emergent, is about the same. Slightly more emergent with 3.4% ER admission versus our composite, so just a slight increase on that front. On the outpatient side, clearly, most of that activity is elective, especially in the surgical area. And so that would suggest, at least in this quarter, we did see more elective business.","I think back to Milton's point, as you have more and more people employed, more and more people covered by employer-sponsored insurance, you could see more elective activities. We have seen growth in our birth rate or birth volumes. That has obviously more of an elective type of case, if you want to call it that. So that's part of the composition as well.","On the labor costs, we're particularly pleased with what's going on with our labor initiatives. I think our overall cost per FTE, when you look at the full composition of salaries, contract labor and benefits, was 2.7% per FTE on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. That's very consistent with the first quarter and with previous quarters in 2017. Our employee engagement as a company improved. Our nursing engagement improved. Our human resources platform, which has been consolidated over the years, is becoming a more effective tool at supporting our facilities in delivering better human resources capability.","So we're very pleased with the overall performance of the company on many metrics. Our nursing turnover hit an all-time low. We feel that in some ways we're winning the market share gain on nurses with what we're doing with our nursing initiative. So we're very encouraged by the efforts and the results that our teams are producing with our overall labor agenda.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Steve. And we have time for just one more question.","Operator","And that question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I want to sort of dig into pricing a little bit. I guess you guys showed another strong quarter of pricing this quarter. How do you think about the sustainability of that number? Is that a good number to think about over the intermediate term? And what is driving it to be higher this year versus the past year or so? Is it mix? Is this acuity thing sustainable? Any other color that you have there.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Kevin.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, I'll try to take that. As you know, Kevin, we had pretty stable pricing for some time. When you look at the commercial pricing, we've talked about, we've got pretty good visibility, and that almost 60% contracted for 2019, and pushing 40% for 2020, and all those at a pretty consistent rate and terms going forward. We've said for some time, we see an overall composite of 2% to 3%. Again, there may be periods we're on the high end of that versus \u2013 and some periods on the low end. I think what's driving now is, clearly, the intensity growth going forward. Maybe a little bit of the drop of that lower acuity business is boosting it as well. So I still think the ranges that we've trended in over the long run is a good peg for HCA.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Kevin, thank you. I want to thank all of you for being on the call and look forward to seeing you and talking to you again. Thank you.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","Thank you, Vic and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast today. Before we go into details about the quarter, let me take a few moments to say a few words about the unprecedented sequence of events that began with hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi and Houston, followed by Hurricane Irma in Florida and then the tragic shooting of Las Vegas. As you know we have significant presence in all these markets.","In Texas, hurricane Harvey first made land fall near our Corpus Christi market where we have a hospital with three campuses and two freestanding emergency rooms. From there it moved to Houston where it dumped record amounts of rain causing significant flooding for days. In Houston market we have 15 hospital campuses, six freestanding emergency rooms, five surgery centers and one freestanding cancer center.","All of these facilities were affected either directly or indirectly. Certain hospitals were evacuated and several resumed evacuating patients from our hospitals and in some cases from non HA hospitals. Several of our hospitals in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio also took evacuated patients. Now, we work on facilities affected by Harvey, where we have approximately 14,000 employees in Houston and Corpus Christi, many of them are still recovering from personal loss.","Just days after Harvey, hurricane Irma struck South Florida sending a path of destruction from south to north across virtually the entire state. Florida of course is one our biggest states with 50 hospital campuses, 32 surgery centers, 17 freestanding emergency rooms, 10 diagnostic imaging centers and more than 63,000 employees. Once again, we evacuated certain facilities and felt the impact of Irma throughout all of Florida and to a lesser extent even into Georgia and South Carolina.","Then as we were recovering from these natural disasters came the horrific shooting in Las Vegas. As a closest trauma center to the concert side, HCAs Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center received approximately 200 victims in one hour. For the entirety of the event, 127 patients with gunshots were in intensive care. All 30 operating rooms were immediately activated and operated throughout the nine following days. In all more than 80 operations were performed. As a relative trauma center, Sunrise dealt with many of the most severely injured patients. Meanwhile Southern Hills and Mountain View hospitals took those less critical and made sure Sunrise had all the necessary staff, supplies and equipment to manage the situation.","While we have very robust disaster preparedness in mass casualty plans in place nothing could have completely prepared us for this [indiscernible] sequence that announced.","I now will speak for entire management team in saying that never been in a time when we were more proud of the incredible team and professionals those lay throughout the organization. Our colleagues at every level of the company, but especially in those communities performed beyond any expectations we can have and demonstrated the best of the HCA culture.","Now moving to spend a few moments on my thoughts around the third quarter, the hurricanes along with Texas Medicare waiver reduction in the quarter add complexity to the evaluation of the third quarter results. However if you look at the broad trends to normalize with the destruction in the hurricane affected markets, we believe many of the trends are comparable with the first half 2017, Sam and Bill will provide detail on some of these trends in a moment.","Third quarter revenues increased 4.2% to $10.7 billion compared to the prior year. Hospitals acquired during 2017 contributed approximately $155 million to the increase in revenues in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totalled $1.776 billion down $181 million in the prior year. As mentioned in our earnings release the estimate to hurricanes unfavourably impacted our third quarter performance by approximately $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share an increased $0.06 in losses of revenue in our Corpus Christi, Florida, Georgia, in South Canada markets.","Also results for the third quarter were negatively impacted by $50 million or $0.08 per diluted share associated with Texas Medicare waiver settlement amounts. As mentioned earlier volumes remained somewhat consistent with the first half of 2017 with same facility admissions increased to 60 basis points and improvement admissions increasing 30 basis points in the prior year. We estimate that the hurricanes had an unfavourable impact of 80 bases points on same facility admissions growth in 80 basis points in same facility equipments admissions growth. This represents the fourteenth consecutive quarter of the equivalent mission growth the company.","Our same facility Medicare admissions comprised 45.5% of the company's overall admissions while our same facility managed care and exchange admissions were 27.2% of total admissions compared to 44.7% and 27.8% respectively in the priors year's third quarter.","As we noted in October '18 third quarter preview, we have updated our guidance for 2017. We currently estimate adjusted EBITDA will range for 28 and 8.15 billion for 2017. This does includes the estimated impact of hurricanes in the Texas Medicaid Waiver program","Settlement amounts.","Earnings per diluted is now estimated to range from $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share. Cash flow operations totalled $1.008 billion compared $1.206 billion in the third quarter of '16. The decline is primarily attributed to the 215 million declines in net income.","Our days in AR increased slightly to 51 compared 50 days at year end and 49 days at the end of the second quarter.","We remain active with share repurchase in the quarter. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $509 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we have repurchased 17.8 million shares at a cost of $1.475 billion.","As you may have seen this morning, the company announced that the board has approved the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization and at October 31, 2017 including this newly announced program and the remaining authorization on the company's November","2016 program, the company has approximately 2.150 billion authorize for share repurchase.","Finally, an update on M&A activity, during the third quarter we closed the acquisition of 5 hospitals in Texas for approximately $880 million. Also in October 1, 2017 we closed on a previously announced Rutherford Texas acquisition. That brings total M&A activity for the year to seven hospitals with two more pending which we believe should close some time in the fourth quarter. The previously announced divestiture of OU Medical Center is now estimated to close on December 31of this year.","And so, with that I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Good morning everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported in the third quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 0.6% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 0.3%.","Year-to-date same-facility equivalent admissions are at 1.2% over the prior year. As Milton noted, we estimate the hurricanes negatively impacted same-facility admissions growth by 30 basis points and equivalent admission growth by 80 basis points. In addition, the less of a business day compared to the third quarter of '16 also impacted some volume statistics.","Sam will provide more commentary in a moment and I'll give you trends by payer class. During the third quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.4% and 3% respectively, compared to the prior year period. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare admissions. Managed Medicare admissions increased 4.9% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior-year period and represent 34.1% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 3.4%.","Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.8% and 2.2% respectively in the quarter, compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 6.4% in the quarter. These represent 8.4% of our total admissions compared to 8% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our same-facility uninsured admissions were up 5.7% from same period last year.","Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.7%, and equivalent admissions declined 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and as we stated in the release, we estimate the hurricanes had a 30 basis point impact on our emergency room growth in the quarter.","Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 20.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter, compared to 19.9% last year. And on a year-to-date basis, same-facility emergency room visits have increased 0.7%.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 3.3% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries declined 0.7% and outpatient surgeries declined 4.2% from the prior year, reflecting the impact from hurricanes in our South Texas, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina facilities.","When adjusted for the hurricane impact and one less business day, we estimate outpatient surgeries declined approximately 0.7% in the quarter. During the third quarter, same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2% from the prior year. Our hospital same-facility managed care, other, and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in the quarter and 4.6% on a year-to-date basis compared to the prior year.","The growth rate in the third quarter was impacted by the comparison to a strong 6.5% growth recorded in Q3 of 2016 and some hurricane impact due to the lower surgery volume. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $369 million in the quarter compared to the prior year.","Same-facility charity care totaled $1.19 billion in the quarter, an increase of $155 million from the prior year period. Our same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.447 billion, an increase of $214 million over the prior year. Our uncompensated levels have trended in line with our uninsured and revenue trends.","Now, we turn to expenses. There is a lot of noise in the quarter from hurricanes that affected our expenses making it more difficult to compare expense trends on a quarterly basis. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.5% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6% for the quarter as compared to 19.1% in the third quarter of last year.","Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 4.9% compared to the last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue increased 140 basis points compared to the third quarter of '16, primarily reflecting hurricane related costs. We are pleased that we have seen reduction in our nursing turnover from 20.2% last year to 18.3% this year. This aligned to a sequential improvement in contract labor on a same-facility basis and total contract labor has grown 2.2% over prior year in the quarter.","Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.2% for the third quarter in the prior year period and supply cost as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points. We continue to see sequential improvement in supply expense as a percentage of revenue during 2017. Other operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased 90 basis points from last year's third quarter to 19.4% of revenues primarily reflecting increases in year-over-year contract services and professional fees that we discussed on our last two calls. This metric was also impacted by hurricane related costs.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.008 billion. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $3.692 billion and free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests was $1.296 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.037 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.08 times at December 31st, 2017, compared to 3.82 times at December 31st of 2016.","Let me speak briefly on our health reform activity. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 12,200 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 12,900 we saw in the third quarter of last year for a decline of 5.8% year-over-year and 4.9% declined sequentially from the second quarter.","We saw about 46,700 same-facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to the 49,300 in the third quarter of 2016 and 52,400 in the second quarter of '17 for a 10.9% decline sequentially. These health reform results are pretty consistent with what we have been seeing in the year and generally speaking track with the Roman activity we see in our markets.","So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel Hazen","All right. Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to provide some additional detail on our volume trends for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year. On a same-facilities basis for our domestic operations, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, Capitol and South Atlantic divisions and conversely our East Florida, Far West, Mid America, Central West Texas and Gulf Coast divisions were weak.","East Florida and Gulf Coast were obviously impacted some by the storms, but we believe both markets have recovered well with no indications of permanent issues. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down for the quarter. Eight of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions; 8 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits.","Freestanding emergency room visits grew 18%, while hospital based emergency room visits declined 1.5%. Once again most of this decline was seen in lower acuity visits. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 1.6%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 7% and 1% respectively. Inpatient surgeries were essentially flat. Surgical admissions were 28% of total admissions in the quarter.","Surgical volumes were strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines. Seven of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were down 4% and volumes were down in both our hospital based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. We have one less business day in the quarter as compared to last year in the storms heading effect.","Behavioral health admissions grew 4.1%. Rehab admissions grew 4%. Cardiology volumes grew 5%. Births were down 2.5% and neonatal admissions were essentially flat. In summary, after adjusting for the estimated impact of the hurricanes, our volume trends were generally consistent with the first half of the year.","As I stated in my comments last quarter, we believe the growth in inpatient demand in general has moderated across most of our markets over the last year, which we believe explains most of our softer volumes. For the 12 months ended March 2017, which is the most current data available, inpatient market share for HCA increased by 10 basis points as compared to the previous period.","Now, let me transition to our operations in London. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for this market was down 12% and both local currency and dollars were approximately $6 million. This decline is less than the last quarter and represents a better overall performance for this division. We anticipate continued improvements in our results over the next few quarters.","Overall we continue to refine and enhance our efforts to improve and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace and ultimately sustain growth for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, Don, if you come back on and let's pull for questions. I would ask that each questioner limit themselves to one question, so we can give everybody an opportunity. Don? Don, are you with us?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. So, Sam, on the call you mentioned that you think inpatient demand is down across your markets. I wanted to get the company's - in a broader view of how we should think about the typical algorithm to what I think you described as 4% to 6% EBITDA growth in terms of market growth, plus market share growth et cetera, plus leveraging the fixed cost to get to that 4% to 6%. If market growth stays where it is today, what do you think a reasonable EBITDA growth rate for the company would be in the near to intermediate term? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","Let me start on the demand point of your question. Justin, I'll let Bill jump in here on some of the other components. Inpatient demands for HCA's markets are still growing. In the first quarter of 2017, which is the most recent data available, our markets, 42 markets grew up 0.8% that's a little bit below our expected level of growth as we think about the overall factors that drive demand for healthcare services in our markets.","If you normalize that a little bit for leap year, it probably grew about 1%; 2016 grew at about 1.4% to 1.5% for inpatient demand and we use that as a general proxy for overall demand with some aspects of outpatient growing faster than that. So, we still are confident that the prospect for growth in HCA's markets is still good.","We have indicated in the past and we continue to believe that over the long run inpatient demand in healthcare services in HCA's markets is going to grow somewhere around 2%. It could be a little bit more, a little bit south of that depending on a number of factors. Our belief around population growth, utilization increases for aging baby boomers.","Chronic conditions and the growth in diabetes and cancer and other obesity, those kind of things are driving demand. And then when you look at the market economies, we still believe there's going to be solid job growth across HCA's markets. So, the company is investing inside of this belief around demand. We're relieving capacity constraints. We're adding outpatient facilities to our network and we're putting ourselves in a position to really compete at a high level.","And so, our approach is built around volume growth. We have to have volume growth I think to be successful. We've had modest volume growth this year in a difficult period with modest market share gains. For us to get to our volume objectives, we have to pick up 20 to 25 basis points of market share, not 10, so we're a little bit short where we want to be.","Again some of that is market-specific. Some of it is competitor-specific, but over the long haul we think we are in a position to achieve that objective and that is obviously a starting point for our ability to achieve our EBITDA targets that we've laid out. I'll let Bill or Milton carry forward on the follow through on that question.","Milton Johnson","Yeah, Sam I've been - just I'm not sure what add to that, but I'll just echo Sam, we still believe in our 4% to 6% long-term EBITDA expectations for the organization. As Sam mentioned, we believe that because of our attractive markets. The population grew. The aging of population were seen in our markets. Good economic conditions in our markets. We've got, as you know, roughly 25% market share on a composite basis in these markets.","We're making substantial capital investments in the markets, including adding some acquisitions. I mentioned seven new hospitals this year, all of those not contributing to earnings growth. In 2017 we expect those acquisitions to contribute to grow in the out years. Our team's execution, their track record of execution, all of those things combined gives us confidence in our guidance for long-term EBITDA growth of 4% to 6%.","Obviously this year has been a challenging year where we're not going to meet that expectation, but if you look back over recent years, we've had years in the last five years where we've exceeded that expectation with a five-year CAGR of just under 6%. So, again all that goes into our thinking about the long-term growth expectations for HCA.","Victor Campbell","All right. Justin, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Maybe I just want to follow up on that question. Would you please think about why the volume number this year is likely to be less than your long-term target? What is it about 2017 and obviously leap year and hurricanes, but even if you exclude those things, you are still coming in below what you would expect to do long-term on volumes? So, what is it about the backdrop today that makes it a challenging backdrop and why would it get better next year? There doesn't seem to be a lot of obvious areas of market improvement heading into next year versus this year.","Samuel Hazen","I don't know. This is Sam again. I don't know that I have every answer to 2017. I mean some of this is a judgment about what we see in the market and if you look back over the last three or four years, it was never the same metric in each of those three or four years. So, one year may grow 3%. One year may grow 1.8%. And so, if you're looking at it over a bit of a longer run, you get to an average that seems to be a reasonable proxy for going forward forecasts around volume growth in our markets.","I mean there has been some level of competition as we've indicated in the past in certain outpatient arenas that can have some downstream implications for us, but that has moderated as I said on the last call and we've seen some saturation if you will of development in certain outpatient elements that have slowed that issue down. So, I think when you look at where we are trending when you normalize for some of these factors, this is just one of those years I believe where the market has been a bit overheated in the past and maybe it just moderated.","But from my standpoint and from the studies that were done, we see no reason that it won't move to the norm over some reasonable period of time. We don't have all of our 2018 budgets finalized yet, so we're not in a position to really provide guidance on that particular year. But if you think about it in the context of the next two to three years, we think growth over that cycle is going to be somewhere consistent with this 2% number.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. I appreciate the color on the third quarter volumes relative to the first half of the year. But I'm curious could you give us any just general commentary about what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter related to any kind of volume recovery, the normal seasonal volume recovery you would see and then is there any difference in the recovery that you're seeing between hurricane affected and non-hurricane affected markets? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","Sam. Well, I can't really give a company view on the volumes coming out of the gate in the fourth quarter, but I will say this. Houston and Miami, which I said in my comments, the indications coming out of the gate in the gate in the fourth quarter given the significance of the aversion to the market, does not suggest any permanent issues, as that would be able resolve the hurricane. So, in Houston we are actually tracking slightly above last year, and in Miami market was slightly below, but we did not estimate why that it is. And it's not related to any kind of permanent market damage, in either of those two markets.","William Rutherford","Right thank you, as you know our practice is we don't talk about third quarter, but that obviously will command over the Columbus hurricane market, so you understand where they stand. Alright, next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning, sort of going back home to the first couple of questions I guess. Despite the pressures you've seen you've been still able to put up 3% same facility revenue growth, obviously this quarter is impacted by the hurricane, which we add that back. You haven't been able to deliver EBITDA, so, are there things you can do amidst cost side that will make you think you could hold the line on margins in 3% top line trend, so as sustained in the next year, or do you really think you need that 4% level plus the whole market?","Samuel Hazen","Yeah, we'll take that, I think that we historically shared that the 4% low level, that's one element from the Miami margin maintenance. Clearly this quarter margin was impacted by the sloppy revenue due to hurricanes, the waiver programs as well as the cost trans in the hurricanes. I also mentioned the acquisitions that we came and didn't cover our margin contribution awareness, so all that will come into play. But, I think that we said that early, you know are right on the lower end of our guidelines, we still anticipate margin maintenance. I think we've got a track work of continuing to maintain that the cost structure; we got a lot of initiatives on the way, will it be our supply cost initiative, continued opportunities on which in the land berg agenda as we have some success in various initiatives through additional nursing turn over. So, I still believe that the 4% level, we still anticipate a margin minus level.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you very much","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho.","Sheryl Skolnick","We don't make calls though, we do write research, thank you very much gentlemen. So, first let it be said, very fitting tribute to the hard work that was done and the commitment and compassion of all the people who cared for everyone else during this quarter in very difficult times - pace to remember the year in hospital business and we can't forget that. But with that we still need to understand and I think the over questions run 2018 probably aren't going to help us. So, maybe I'll stay back and ask a different question about the company's forward-looking strategy. The first time in a long time you are doing acquisitions, you're still committed to a grow market share build the depth most integrated, strongest best quality hospital systems in market. You've invested a time and big data which we haven't about on these calls, I presumably you've done to add to the value creation on a day-to-day basis and forward. So, Will can you frame what the strategy in terms of, it sounds like you are adding to the usual day-to-day, what we've come to expect from HCA outstanding execution and brilliant market. But, it sounds like you are adding another like to the store and that there are more things that could come to play, next year or the year after from the perspective of strategy, the company is pursuing, so please enlighten us?","William Rutherford","Sure, so we have been more inquisitive this year, we've had more opportunities in you need know our company and that we are not that very comfortable should they have a certain number of hospitals. We look to acquire hospitals and markets, where we see long term positive popular demand growth opportunities. And, we theatrically want to have the relative amount of market share going into our new market. You know in Savannah, gives us that, as I've said in my comments, we hope to close in Savannah about the end of the year, and we are excited about the opportunity to go into a new market.","There are lot of hospitals for children, hospitals are more supplementary to our existing markets like Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio or Jacksonville. We will continue to look for those opportunities. We today are final on ramp positions is really good, as I said, I mean for last calls, it's probably the best pipeline we had and maybe in 15 years or 20 years. And so, marked up on more flabby opportunities, so, we continue to look for those in add that to our strategy going forward. With respect to big data, there we have invested quite a bit, and it's already contributing. Where you see the contribution, we see it in a number of ways, but primarily and most importantly we see it in quality inside the care way it provides. I was using our clinical data to improve care in our hospitals, is something that we are making right start in, I know we are just getting started, like the interface is getting started there. But we are making a difference anyways saving the lives of the treatment of Sceptisis, blood utilization and another and number of other areas.","So, we all continue to invest in that area continued to be benefited from that for our patients. And of course that attracts great positions, which of course contributes to our growth strategy as well overall. So, all that is part of our strategy Sheryl, I think that we will continue to look for growth opportunities, freelance positions and also growth opportunities through using proprietary information like our big data and how we can use that to continue to leverage our position in the markets.","Samuel Hazen","That's great Jon, perhaps you're chief medical directive, you want to add anything to that.","Jon Foster","Sure, thanks for the question already sided with out guard using the daily channel rated by product occasionally, to cure, to heal, continuous improvement that our caretakers are officially enrolled. We have the privilege of 28 million patient encounters every year, is this 28 million patient encounters generate a lot of data, that is directly seen [indiscernible] into the security of individual patient getting the power slice opportunities for precision medicine. But, they also keep forwarding to operate, used to give us insight into 40 minutes of business plan. Therefore, we have work going on right now, to protect them in the emergency room and improve their matching's or outstand of the intra newly better cure and better efficiency.","You know, in efficiency we also happen to have unstructured data, we just matter in line which processing them all. So, automatically our cancer patients navigation, 306 cancer navigators used to spend 70% of the time finding patients, they now spend 70% of them in taking care of patients which helps in number [indiscernible] or we've been entitled to provide the care that improves the efficiency and some materialization in our system as we meet their need. Previously stated, feeding the operational networks and that's what this provided time on evaluator; it now allows us to increase our effective capacity, I haven't still why it is still not going up for, it's really got to create a virtually cycle learning and improving. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey good morning guys, first question on capital deployment, I think in back 2015 we talked about an annual CapEx program that answers itself? So, how are you thinking about sustaining that or pushing that to 2018, especially given the growth outgrow that you guys played out. Is it something that you expect to contained and just stay that level, or we're re-shifting the capital focus to exact positions to plug the growth from what seems to be a slowing organic outlook?","Samuel Hazen","I want to say the thing what I add on bill. Well our CapEx expenditure program, we have been setting it up at approximate $3 billion this year. I would expect for the year- end for 2018, it will continue at the low volume and move on, obviously some of the acquisitions that we made will have some capital investment there, on top of our base of hospitals and markets that we have. So, and after may look beyond 2018, we do have more flexible floating in our capital budget as far as commitments so, we are judged that as we go through the coming months in quarters, as in the proper amount of investment, but we will continue to make investments. As you know, our growth story is largely banked on organic growth story and again as I mentioned we are in great markets with population growth and we expect demand, so I think you'll continue to see us invest, but beyond next year, we'll wait and see, but we do that more flexibly with respect to capital.","Operator","We will go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein.","Lance Wilkes","Yeah, good morning just wanted to know what your outlook was for 2018 commercial managed care rate increases compared to 2017 and then kind of related to that what are you seeing as far as neuro network strategies and you are taking risk in those kind of commercial managed cares were to patients.","Samuel Hazen","At this particular point in time the company is about 80% contracted for 2018, 75% to 80%. And almost identical term is to 2017 so all round 4% on our pricing trends with our commercial book of business and where about 35% to 40% into 2019 and about the same number. It was starting to pay say a little bit differently because we think there are certain reasons to the above business we are. So we can expect about 2019 and 2020 with respect to the need for some pricing adjustments possibly. But as it relates to neuro networks in risk taking, I would say I general not a lot has changed. We are not seeing significant neuro network development outside of the exchanges where we have been operating inside of that model. Ourselves as, as some of our competitors. Clearly there are evolving models in certain markets at different levels around accountable cure organizations and other models such as that we have a number of those within our portfolio of offerings with pairs in such so there is not broad based movement though on those fronts on the commercial book of business. I would say on the Medicare advantage side equation, there tends to be more deeper penetration of those type of things in the areas on the commercial side. So we are not seeing any significant movement though across the company that would suggest a major structural change in the near term possibly in the intermediate term in some markets but again not across 42 different markets.","Lance Wilkes","Great thank.","Operator","We will go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo","Hi, thanks. Bill, back to the comment on years nurses turnover, I am just may be curios entering 2018 what is with these neuro initiatives resources or strategies you have around your programs I think a couple of years ago you were pretty successful on boarding physicians early into the organization I think like you kind of perhaps maybe you are offering something larger, a larger focus on something for the company so just maybe any comments just the nurse programs.","Samuel Hazen","So Whit it is the same, let me take this. We are really pleased with where we are with our initiatives around nursing in general and specifically around nursing turnover as Bill indicated, we are - we have improved our nursing turnover in about 15 months, 18 months by 200 basis points. Our nursing contract labor for the quarter, the spend on nursing contract labor not our components of contract labor in the company was actually day on in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we are very encouraged by that trend. We think we still have head room in a number of retention initiatives that will drive that metric down even further. I will tell you, we just checked off a second innovation of our nursing strategy, Milton provided an idea for the whole company. We have a very robust nursing agenda that we believe is going to ultimately differentiate HCA further from a nursing stand point. At our core the company is a nursing company. We provide nursing care in ERs, in the ORs on the floors in our cardiac CAT lab, whatever the case maybe. And we are seeing and finding ways to leverage what are called the HCA way to weight improve nursing. Part of that is creating organizational capacity for improvement, part of that is standardizing technology on the floors so that our nurses can spend more time in the bed - by the bedside with our patients. And an example of this we acquired the company a few years ago that had some unique technology that allows us to communicate within our nursing environment more effective with our patients [ph] more effectively with physicians and so forth. We have got one third of the way through rolling that particular technology up. And then I will tell you the last thing is really working with our nurse managers and our nurses to deal with pain point that prevent them from being at successful as they want to be. We think this is all connected to on boarding, nurse residency programs and evolved in the company an ongoing clinical education which we believe will produce more component work force, more capable work force and more efficient work force generating better patient outcomes clearly greater position in components as Milton indicated a moment ago we ultimately think driving more volume. So our nursing initiative is being resourced very comprehensively and we think there is a lot of opportunities for our improvements in what we are doing inside of our facilities.","Whit Mayo","Well, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.","Matthew Borsch","Yeah, those - hoping maybe we just talk I know your pointing to a number of the long term growth drivers can we think about the demographic shift, how do you think about the positive impact clearly from that aging trend which is very strong versus the offset of the mix shift from I am sorry to lower Medicare reimbursement?","Victor Campbell","All right, anybody to take a swing at that?","Samuel Hazen","Well, Mat, [indiscernible] in this trend of demographic change and its coupled with higher utilization, but let me talked about we have seen some changes between governmental and commercial mix. I don't think that were projecting that to be materially different in terms of year-over-year trend in what we have seen and so we have got strategies around the managed care and commercial side to trying to manage through that as well as just a overall effort to gain commercial markets shares. So it kind of offsets that under pending migration yeah, from commercial to governmental affairs.","Matthew Borsch","No, I just kind of asking you said - you are still in that positive when you factor that all in - in terms of the one hand the '18 trend on the other hand that Medicare pace left?","Samuel Hazen","We clearly as utilization grows as people aids through those continuing such going to generate more of the imports. So we can continue to - as we continue to see that trend, I think we will be in positive. The one thing that I think is important is it is when you look at our markets, our forecast for commercial demand, not just overall demand, the overall demand is being stocked if you will by the aging baby rumours and a few other components but the commercial demand side equation at least rates A markets we believe, it's still going to grow also and it won't grow with that composite number, but we believe it will grow somewhere 3.5 a point and point and so if we can maintain market share or grow market share inside of that overall demand picture then that obviously compensates for some of the margin dilution if you will that comes from a Medicare patients which is obviously less profitable than a commercial patient. So that's how we think it about, we have to ultimately grow or maintain our market share on the commercial side to make them all work.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you.","Samuel Hazen","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte","Yeah, thanks good morning. On the 2% admissions growth normalize, how do you think about the mix of things to angulatory and moves out the hospital deals with urgent care. I heard you tonight as saying that they can get 50% lower bed utilization in their optimum care markets and they stay of a 90% of AD visit possible in urgent care and is that trends slowing down or is it accelerating or how is that factoring into 2%.","Samuel Hazen","Let me give this a same - let me give you a couple of metrics to you for the quarter and this is pretty consistent for the year. Our lower acuity levels in our emergency rooms has declined 3%. Our upper level acuity visits - upper three levels has grown 3.8% so it actually seeing more growth from the high end then we have we obviously we had declines in the low ends. Our pricing in our emergency room tends to be stepped up based upon that and so from that stand point we are growing our higher priced emergency room visits. We are seeing declines in some areas on the lower, so the revenue production coming out our emergency room is still very, very strong. To suggest at 90% if I heard it correctly emergency room visits can be put into urgent care, there is no way that can happen. It is not possible, there is too much acute activity on the emergency room side for that to occur. We have urgent care centers developing across the HCA as a platform as well as an extension of our network I think we are up to almost a 100 urgent care centres in a very complimentary to our overall networking position and we do think for certain patients and in certain situations it is the better center and a better setting for care than the emergency room obviously, but they are very complimentary and they are very important to the market place, they are very important to the market place, they are very important to the network and they are very important to the payers in having access to a broader way of facility both in urgent care and emergency services. So that trend has so stabilized I would say, there is not much difference over the last few quarters and where that has gone within our emergency room and what the trends have done. We won't just have to see how that place up from one market to the other, there are differences in some markets. You are right there could be some differences in how that places are, but broadly across the company those are big trends.","Ana Gupte","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the same facility on insured admissions increases, seems like it worsened a little bit on sequentially in the quarter. Are you guys trying to say that most of that or all of that is explained by declining ACA volumes and if not, what are the dynamics are in play at this point? Thanks.","William Rutherford","Yeah, this is Bill. So we reported 6.4% in the quarter, I think we run in 5.7% year-to-date, so it's jumped on us a little bit but I really don't judge that to be a materially jam as we - went into 2017 if we could to keep uninsured volume in that made to high single digits that's kind of what we anticipated as we have stated before 70% of our uninsured volumes in Texas and Florida. We are correlating that to the drop in the health insurance exchange. I think that is kind of the underlying number that we are seeing at a 6% level, 6.5% I think that's within a historical range that we expect, remind you that the impact of the growing uninsured is available cost to solve that and at mid-single digit level, I think that's within the confines of overall expectations and guidance.","Victor Campbell","Thank, you Chris. One last question.","Operator","We will go then to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah James","Hi, thanks for putting me in. Can you give us some context around where HCA sets now in some of these shifting markets? So how much of your current inpatient admissions or revenue is related to the procedures, the philosophy done in outpatient and think for ER, how much of the ER revenue or admissions is currently in low acuity?","Samuel Hazen","On the ER question, about 45% to 48% of our ER businesses are low acuity and obviously the balance of that is in the upper 3 acuity levels, so little bit more on the upper side than the lower side. To suggest that our inpatients procedures that ought to be done as outpatients, I don't see that as a case at all. I mean there is all kinds of protocols from a governmental stand point as well from a commercial pay roll stand point around approving procedures that are done in the inpatient setting and or the outpatient setting. So that's really not a phenomenon and that I think is out of source, I will tell there is always movement from inpatients to outpatients. That's inner trend, it's been there for a decade up or so, but there are also new technologies that are driving inpatient activity. We have seen that vascular care in other aspects of different service lines. So there always it's in out that goes inside of these two components of our business, but we aren't seeing any unique trans from inpatient to orthopedic services, but they are not anything that's so substantial that's going to disrupt the revenue stream on the inpatient or overly accelerate the revenue stream of the out patients at least in our judgment.","Victor Campbell","All right, Sarah, thank you. I want to just thank everyone for being on the call. Have any further questions feel free to give Mark a call. Thank you so much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Kimbrough","Okay. Thank you, Cody. Good morning, and welcome to all of you on today\u2019s call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and Bill Rutherford, our CFO, which will provide comments on the company\u2019s results for the first quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today\u2019s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today\u2019s press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company\u2019s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Now the company undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning\u2019s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today\u2019s first quarter earnings release. This morning\u2019s call is being recorded and a replay will be available later on today.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel Hazen","All right. Thank you, Mark. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported a great start to 2019. The results for the quarter were driven by strong revenue growth and improvements in operating margin. Revenue grew by almost $1.1 billion, close to 10% in the quarter. This growth was driven by volume growth in commercial business, volume growth in more complex services and new acquisitions.","On the same-facilities basis, revenue grew by $700,000, or 6.3%. Inpatient admissions and equivalent admission on a same-facilities basis grew 0.9% and 1.8%, respectively in the quarter. We estimate the flu volumes from last year had an approximate 1% unfavorable impact on our volume growth this year.","Volume growth was broad-based across most service categories and balanced across our markets. The growth in revenue translated into solid earnings in the quarter, with diluted earnings per share of $2.97. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% to over $2.5 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin at 20.3%. As a result of this quarter\u2019s results, we are raising our guidance for the year. Bill will provide more details on our metrics and updated 2019 guidance in his comments.","The first quarter continued the positive momentum we have seen over the past six quarters. Commercial adjusted admissions grew in each of these quarters. Also, we have now grown our same-facilities inpatient admissions in 20 consecutive quarters. The strategic investments in our business to expand our networks and improve our clinical capabilities are making it easier for patients to get high-quality convenient patient care in an HCA Healthcare facility.","The most recently available inpatient market share data showed good growth for the company. We grew by over 50 basis points to an all-time high of 25.3%. We have almost $4.3 billion of capital spending in the pipeline that we expect to come online over the next few years. These investments will create additional inpatient and outpatient capacity within our local healthcare systems.","We believe that fundamentals in our markets remain strong with growing demand for healthcare services. We also believe we are well-positioned for growth, as we continue to execute our operational initiatives, improve the overall competitive positioning of our local healthcare systems and integrate our acquired hospitals.","During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in the Galen College of Nursing. We are excited about this pending deal. HCA Healthcare has been investing heavily in nursing over the past few years, so our nurses can be successful and provide the best possible patient care. This investment creates new opportunities for Galen to expand programs into more of our markets.","And finally, I want to thank our employees and physicians for their great work in delivering high-quality care to our patients.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the first quarter results, then we will open the call for questions. As Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the first quarter results.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $2.541 billion, up from $2.118 billion last year. As noted in our release, the first quarter of 2019 results include an $86 million increase to our revenues as a result of finalizing an arbitration related to past out-of-network claims. So let me cover some volume steps.","During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.4% and 2%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 2.5% and equivalent admissions increased 0.3% in the quarter.","Our commercial admissions increased 1.3% and equivalent admissions increased 2.5% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self pay and charity admissions were unchanged in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits declined 2.3% in the first quarter compared to the prior year.","We attribute about 130 basis points to this year\u2019s weakened flu season. Additionally, when we look at the changes by acuity level, all of the first quarter declines are in our level one through level three visits, which declined 7%. Our higher acuity level four and five visits grew 2.2% over the prior year. In addition, admissions to the emergency room increased by 1.7% over the prior year.","Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% in the quarter. The arbitration settlement accounted for 80 basis points of this increase. We are pleased with the overall rate trends we experienced in the first quarter, as we saw continued growth in acuity, good payer mix, as well as the incremental Medicare update.","We believe our visibility around commercial rate remains solid, as we have a significant percentage of our commercial contracts completed for 2019 and 2020 at terms and rates consistent with our recent trends.","Now let me turn to expenses. We are pleased with the overall management of expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter were 20.3%, as reported, and our same facility adjusted EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points over the prior year.","On a consolidated basis, total labor cost improved to 120 basis points, supply cost improved 50 basis points and other operating expenses improved 10 basis points. So let me take a moment to talk about earnings per share and cash flow.","As reported, diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019, excluding gains and losses on sale of facilities was $2.97 versus $2.33 in the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $974 million versus $1.283 billion in the first quarter of last year. The primary item that negatively impacted the year-over-year comparisons was that in the first quarter of 2019, we funded $428 million for our 401(k) match for 2018. This item was included in our 2019 plan and cash flow from operations guidance.","Capital spending for the first quarter was $781 million, in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we paid $278 million to repurchase 2.1 million shares and have $1.995 billion remaining on our previous authorization as of March 31, 2019,","Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.71 times.","As noted in our release, we increased our 2019 guidance with adjusted EBITDA now expected to range between $9.4 billion and $9.85 billion and earnings per share expected to range between $9.80 and $10.40 per diluted share. Revenue and capital guidance remains unchanged.","So that concludes my remarks. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mark to open it up for Q&A.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we might give as many as possible in the queue today an opportunity to ask a question. Cody, you can now give instructions to those who may want to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning. I had a few quantitative questions, but I guess, I\u2019ll just ask the biggest one after such a really strong quarter, at least, dramatically stronger than the Street was expecting. You only raised the annual guidance by $100 million or slightly more than the extent of the arbitration gain. So is there just an abundance of conservatism in the forward guidance, does the Street really have the first quarter just mis-modeled, or is there anything else in the year that gives you a little bit of caution at this point in terms of raising the guidance further?","Samuel Hazen","Okay, Gary. I\u2019ll let Bill take this one.","William Rutherford","Hey, Gary, this is Bill. I\u2019ll start and Sam can add in. So, we typically don\u2019t address guidance after just one quarter, but given our performance, we believe it was appropriate. And as you said, one way to look at it is the raise is due to the payer arbitration, which wasn\u2019t in our original guidance.","We continue to see momentum as we saw when we turned the calendar in the core operations and acquisitions improving. As I think about it, if you look at the remaining nine months of the year and after considering that last year we booked some Harvey insurance proceeds in a professional liability, our new reflected guidance has about a 6% growth at the midpoint and almost 9% growth at the high-point. So at this point, we think that\u2019s appropriate. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate it as the year goes on. But I do think we continue to see momentum in the core operating of the business.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks, Gary.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you.","Samuel Hazen","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my question. First quarter same-store revenue was obviously sort of very strong, and we saw some nice SG&A leverage as expected. Excluding sort of the $86 million from the out-of-network revenue, do you look to see any leverage on the OpEx line? And I\u2019m just curious if you could walk us through if that was due to acquisitions or how we should think about OpEx leverage with same-store revenues on this front?","William Rutherford","Well, I guess, we look \u2013 there was operating expense leverage. We had a nice margin expansion for the year. If you look at almost any line item, especially on the same-facility basis, we had 200 basis points margin expansion even on a same-facility basis. So, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019re on the top side of our revenue guidance. We do expect to see margin expansion and indeed, we saw that for the quarter.","Samuel Hazen","Yes. And let me just add a couple of things here, Bill. I mean, we did $700 million at same-stores revenue growth\u2026","William Rutherford","Yes.","Samuel Hazen","\u2026and we cleared about 54% of it to the EBITDA line. So our same-stores EBITDA margin jumped almost 200 basis points, which really is above sort of our expectation on an incremental revenue clearance standpoint. So we\u2019re not seeing the same thing there, Pito that you are seeing.","Our overall operating expense per adjusted admission was only up 1.7% on a same-stores basis, again, well underneath our revenue per unit. And so we were pretty pleased and actually quite pleased with the expense metrics for the company.","Pito Chickering","Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks, Pito.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll hear now from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.","A.J. Rice","Hi. Maybe just \u2013 I was actually going to pursue that in a different way. It look like relative to us that your salary and benefits and supply expense, I know you\u2019ve got leverage from outperforming the revenue line, but they look particularly strong in terms of the ratios.","Is there any particular initiatives that you\u2019re pursuing that would be worth highlighting there? And I know specifically on the supply side, I think, you announced a \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve announced it. But I think there\u2019s a new PBM contract that you have. What \u2013 is that going to move the needle for you in any significant way?","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, A.J.","Samuel Hazen","This is Sam, A.J., thank you for that. I think, HCA Healthcare in general is in a constant pursuit of trying to find ways to gain efficiencies and improve profitability. And so I wouldn\u2019t say anything is necessarily that new in our mindset.","I mean, we\u2019re constantly finding opportunities. We believe across the company as we get better analytics, as we do better benchmarking and as we come up with technology solutions that we believe can yield value. And so we do have a number of initiatives connected to those three categories.","With respect to the PBM relationship, there was an announcement about a transition that will take effect in 2020, and we\u2019ve had a great relationship with CBS in the past. We had a compelling offer put in front of us by Optum and we chose to pursue that, so we\u2019ll transition to that relationship next year. But that\u2019s just part of our ongoing renewal process inside of our supply chain efforts and they do a great job of evaluating different opportunities and different approaches as contracts come up for renewal.","But I think our teams are very disciplined in their day-to-day activities. They do a great job of managing variable expenses and then the company is doing a good job in trying to find ways to reduce fixed costs and create a platform that allows revenue growth to really clear to the bottom line appropriately. So we just continue on sort of the same pathway is what I would tell you.","Obviously, there\u2019s questions about wages and so forth. We\u2019ve been able to maintain wages around our expectations were slightly under 3%, and we\u2019ve been able to find ways to improve productivity in the face of what I would call decent volume growth and not great volume growth, so that was encouraging. And then we continue to execute on our nursing and human resource initiatives, which are yielding reduced turnover reductions in contract labor, and all that played a part in the performance in the quarter.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, A.J.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. You referenced recent acquisitions in terms of its contribution to your results. Just curious if you could give us a little update on a couple of those recent wins be it Mission or Savannah, Houston. And I noticed that you also talked about a higher-level of CapEx investment, I think, $0.3 billion now, up from $3.5 billion last quarter. Anymore color around where that\u2019s going to be allocated? Is that more into recent acquisitions, just any color there? Thanks.","William Rutherford","Yes. Hey, Frank, this is Bill. Let me start with the acquisition performance and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the acquisitions. They\u2019re on plan. First, as you mentioned, Mission is going very well. We\u2019re just two months into it, obviously, but we\u2019re excited for Mission Health to join the HCA network. We\u2019re pleased with how the integration is going and their performance is on plan at this point.","Memorial on Savannah had a good quarter, continue to operate on their plan, so very solid performance from Savannah. We\u2019re also very pleased with our performance of our North Cypress facility in Houston. This is also on our plan.","So overall, we\u2019re right where we anticipated to be. If you recall, as we had our year-end call, we anticipated the acquisitions to contribute roughly 3% of EBITDA growth in 2019 and they achieved that level in the first quarter. So very pleased with the performance and seem to be on track with what our expectations were.","On the capital increase, yes, there is some increased capital related to Mission and then as we continue to see opportunities in the market. But our capital spend and trends are online with what we originally guided.","Samuel Hazen","Yes, but most of that step up, Bill, is related to sort of existing markets. The $3.5 billion, Frank, to the $4.3 billion, there are a few projects that are related to our acquisitions. But most of that is the continuing investments in our existing markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to improve our network positioning to increase capacity in key areas and drive technology improvements, along certain services lines that we think are differentiators for HCA and we continue to invest in that at this particular point in time.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Frank.","Frank Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of your competitors seem to see a little bit faster medical admissions and a little bit slower growth in surgical admissions. You didn\u2019t seem to have that issue. Could that be, because you\u2019re taking share in the surgical side and the other guys are not taking as much share and there\u2019s just something going on with the market, or do you think it\u2019s just totally separate companies and geographies?","Samuel Hazen","This is Sam. Thank you for that question. Our inpatient surgeries were flat in the quarter. A lot of that was driven by some C-section reductions. But our outpatient surgeries conversely were up and especially inside of our hospital-based outpatient surgery centers, which were up 3 %.","So one thing we did have in the first quarter is, we have one less surgical day. And so the calendar is not present what I would call it a favorable calendar and surgical set of days. And so that yielded some pressure on surgery. So if you look at surgery on a per business day standpoint, which is how we look at it, we had really strong surgical activity.","I think the company\u2019s efforts around creating what we call the OR of choice has been very productive for us. We\u2019ve been on this journey since 2012 to improve the operations of our surgical suites and appeal to our surgeons in a way that create efficiency, better nursing, better technology offerings and so forth inside of our surgical suites. When you couple that with better improvements inpatient satisfaction, you yield a pretty positive result.","The other thing I will tell you is that, some of the deep service line capabilities that we are building or have built are surgically oriented in nature. For example, trauma is heavily surgery-oriented, burn heavily surgery-oriented, cardiovascular, a lot of surgical growth this quarter for us in cardiovascular, and even our robotics investments that we\u2019ve made have been very productive for us as we look at surgery across the line.","As I mentioned in my comments, the company has achieved a high watermark on its inpatient market share. We think that\u2019s fairly broad-based across different service lines, which include the surgery components. So we\u2019re very pleased with our surgical initiatives the investments that we\u2019re making, and we think broadly it\u2019s having an impact in the market with our physicians and with our patients and it\u2019s yielding pretty solid growth for us.","Peter Costa","Thank you. And just if I could have a follow-up. Given the strength in surgeries that you\u2019re showing and the strength from the acquisitions, isn\u2019t it time to come off your long-term EBITDA growth rate target of 4% to 6%?","William Rutherford","Well, we\u2019re not ready to do that yet. And so, obviously, this year we guided above that and last year we did perform above that and we\u2019ll have to evaluate that as we get through the rest of this year and look at some of the other factors that are important to long-term guidance. But we hear your point and your question and it\u2019s not a bad question by any means and we\u2019re working our way through it.","I think it\u2019s important to understand, we\u2019re pushing 100% on as many fronts as we possibly can. And if we can produce 20% EBITDA growth like we did this quarter, we\u2019ll do that. And so I don\u2019t think the management team is trying to beat down the performance of this company. We\u2019re trying to lift it up wherever we can find it, and we understand the guidance is a part of that, but we will continue to look at that as we move through the rest of the year.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Peter.","Peter Costa","Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Mark Kimbrough","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Can you guys comment on the IPPS proposal for 2020 in the company specific impact? And then what does your 2019 guidance assume for the calendar fourth quarter as they reflect the favorable proposal, or a lower more typical average?","Samuel Hazen","Hey, Mike.","William Rutherford","Yes, Mike, this is Bill. I\u2019ll take it. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at that proposal as everybody else is still early, so we haven\u2019t quantified it. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate that as we go through the common period, so no specifics on there.","Relative to our guidance, I will say, our guidance anticipate in the fourth quarter that we will return back to kind of a normal Medicare rate update. We did have incredible rate this year that were in that we talked about on our year-end call. So our guidance did presume that we go back to a normal rate. So we\u2019ll have to see what that final IPPS rate turns out to be once we go through the common period. And when we get closer, we\u2019ll comment on the quantification of that.","Michael Newshel","All right. Thank you.","Samuel Hazen","Yes.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.","Ann Hynes","Hi, good morning.","Samuel Hazen","Hi, Ann.","Ann Hynes","Could you give us some detail, I think, the investment in Galen College of Nursing is interesting? How do you think that will improve expenses over time, and maybe when more we see that investment at the income statement? Thanks.","William Rutherford","Thanks, Ann. So the Galen College of Nursing is a very exciting acquisition for HCA Healthcare. This is a very impressive organization. We think their culture lines up great with HCA. Their strategy and their discipline around standardization and how they scale their solutions was very impressive to us.","And so we see this as an opportunity to put on the front-end of our nursing agenda, an education component that will allow us to interact with nursing students early on in their journey to be a nurse and hopefully integrate them into the HCA Healthcare network in a way that allows us to source talent for our investments in our growth and so forth.","As far as expenses, we see some opportunities to use their platform as we expanded in our broader education initiatives. HCA has a very robust clinical education agenda that\u2019s underway and we see the Galen College of Nursing as being very complimentary and in some cases synergistic with that particular effort. We haven\u2019t put a number to that as of yet. We have to close this deal hopefully by the end of this year through a regulatory process that we\u2019re going through currently.","But once we get through that, we\u2019re going to be fairly quick in trying to expand their model into different HCA markets, so that we can get moving on it. But we don\u2019t have any numbers yet specifically on expense synergies, but we do think it\u2019s going to create opportunities for us to enhance the pipeline of nurses into our company.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Gillmor with Robert W. Baird.","Matthew Gillmor","Hey, thanks. Following up on Peter\u2019s question, can you quantify the calendar impact on volumes? And then did the Hurricane Michael have any lingering impact on the Panama facility that impacted overall volumes at all?","Samuel Hazen","This is Sam. Thank you for that question. On the second part of your question, the short answer is no. Our Gulf Coast, the Medical Center in Panama City, that\u2019s an incredible group of people down there in what they went through and how quickly they rebounded, and I want to take the opportunity since you asked the question to thank them again for everything they\u2019ve done.","So we\u2019re up and running fully at that particular hospitals. So our corporate teams, our local teams, other markets supported that hospital in getting up and running, so it had no impact on the quarter, as it relates to volume. I think the way we look at surgery, especially on the outpatient side, almost 95% to 98% of all outpatient surgeries are done on weekdays.","So when you look at one less week day in the quarter and then you put the outpatient surgeries on top of that, you can get the sense of what our per calendar day or business day rather surgical volumes were \u2013 I\u2019m not doing the math here on my phone, but nonetheless I\u2019ll give you some sense of it.","On the inpatient surgery side, it\u2019s not as much. We do surgeries on the weekends, mainly for emergency patients, but it\u2019s a small number. So I think the inpatient surgeries are also influenced by the business day calendar, but not nearly as much as the outpatient. And then you have the same kind of impact on cardiology business, which the company had tremendous cardiology growth in the quarter.","Our cardiac volumes were up 3% on the procedures side. Our electrophysiology volumes were up 5%, again, that\u2019s in the face of a business calendar that was a little softer than the previous year, and our cardiovascular surgeries were up 4%, so very solid growth in that particular service line as well. And I think, again, somewhat impacted by the calendar, but we overpowered that as we went through the quarter.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Gillmor","Got it. Thanks, Sam.","Samuel Hazen","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Whit Mayo with UBS.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Sam, I don\u2019t want to jump the shark, but assuming that we may see some CON law changes in Florida, maybe mostly around some tertiary services. What does this mean for HCA?","Samuel Hazen","We have not seen the final rules on the CON regulation changes in Florida as of yet. Florida is fairly relaxed currently on a lot of their CON rules. There is no restrictions of any significance on expansion of existing facilities. There are opportunities to do certain outpatient facilities without certificate of need requirements. So it is gradually relaxed itself over the years.","I mean, the opportunity for us would be new hospitals, potentially in certain markets. It would also mean new programs, for example, rehab is a very restrictive CON process today, so our opportunity to get into that service line would be potentially available to us if the CON rules are changed on that front. And then there\u2019s a few other programs where there are some restrictions that as we understand it could be relaxed. So we\u2019ll learn more as this bill continues to progress through the legislative process.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from\u2026","Whit Mayo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup.","Samuel Hazen","Hey, Ralph.","Ralph Giacobbe","Hey, good morning. Are there more of these larger arbitration cases outstanding? I know they happen from time to time, just trying to get a sense of whether there\u2019s more of a bullish at this point? And with the out-of-network related to exchanges specifically, or was it broader commercial and over what period of time? Thanks.","William Rutherford","Yes, Ralph, this is Bill. From time to time, we have discussions and disputes with payers that result in arbitration and this was one of those, I can\u2019t say that there\u2019s a big one now that we see near-term. This did relate to health insurance exchange activity in the early periods of health reform, principally 2015, 2015, with a little bit of 2016.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks, Ralph.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into the margin improvements, because that seems to be where the biggest surprise, and I guess maybe labor in particular. I guess, we\u2019re all kind of assuming that as the economy keeps improving that wages are going up and that this will be more of a pressure on you going forward, but really good labor cost growth in the quarter. So I just want to understand what was driving that and how you think about that number tracking through the year?","William Rutherford","Well, I spoke to most of the details a minute ago on labor and how we viewed it. Again, if you look at same stores for the company, our labor costs were up 3.6% on revenue growth of 6.3%. We were able to find some productivity inside of that and manage our wages, as I said, under 3%.","So we had good reductions in contract labor. And I just think overall, really well managed by our facilities. Obviously, when we have commercial volume and we have high intensity volume, we aren\u2019t using a ton of marginal cost to support that. We\u2019re using some marginal cost for sure, but because it\u2019s got more revenue turnover and more revenue yield per patient, if you will, it clears more effectively. And that shows itself in the margin expansion that I mentioned as well earlier in the call and it shows itself significantly in labor as well when you figure roughly 50% of our labor costs in HCA are fixed in nature.","And so to the extent, we have some volume growth, but really good volume growth as far as the mix of that volume. It clears itself pretty effectively through the different expense categories, and that\u2019s what we saw in the first quarter. As it relates to the rest of the year, we\u2019re not anticipating anything significantly different with respect to labor pressures.","We continue to execute the multiple agendas that we have to improve our environment for our employees. So it\u2019s a better place to work and more attractive to them, and we don\u2019t see any unusual cost pressures coming from that.","Kevin Fischbeck","Thanks to hear them.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. I appreciate, guys, taking the call \u2013 the question. I guess, it\u2019s been a little while since we\u2019ve talked about taking risk. And I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes in the market or payer expectations or even in the HCA side in terms of your appetite to be taking more risk, and I guess sort of attitudes from payers, et cetera, everything along that line?","Samuel Hazen","This is Sam. Thank you for that question. Nothing in our view has changed materially across our 43 different markets. We continue to interact with the payers, I think, very effectively and strategically in many instances. I think the approach that we take to building on our network with various outpatient facilities that have different price points is productive for the payers and at the same time very convenient and efficient and satisfying for our patients. That\u2019s been effective for us.","We do have some contracts where they\u2019re value-based provisions in them and so forth. I think what people fail to recognize is that, HCA on a roughly 75% to 80% of its inpatient admissions takes a former risk. In that, we get DRG payments or we get a case rate payment on a particular patient and it\u2019s our responsibilities to manage efficiently underneath that.","And so we are taking forms of risk. We\u2019re not taking risk outside of the walls of the hospital in any material way, because we don\u2019t feel we\u2019re in a position to control that or influence that or even price that necessarily.","So our approach has been to focus on risk parameters that we can control that we have some visibility into and then be a really productive partner for the payers by meeting their needs with different facility offerings with very efficient high-quality outcomes that don\u2019t result in readmissions or don\u2019t result in infections or longer lengths of stay and such. And so that\u2019s been our approach, and we think that generally is workable with the payers. So we are really seeing any significant changes broadly across the marketplace.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Josh.","Josh Raskin","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. I\u2019m interested if you could just touch on some of the key factors that drove the year-over-year change in operating cash flows, particularly as it relates to the DSOs and then maybe update us just on anything to call out around the quarterly cadence of operating cash flow over the remainder of the year?","Samuel Hazen","Hi, Scott, thanks.","William Rutherford","Yes, Scott, this is Bill. So as I called out in my comments, the most significant item that affected the year-over-year cash flow was our 401(k) match that we funded in the first quarter related to 2018. There were a couple other items that affected it. The payer settlement we spoke to went into receivables in the first quarter, we\u2019ve subsequently collected that in April.","With the Mission AR acquisition, there were some increased receivables just given we were two months into that, both of those were in the $80 million range. So when we adjust for those or cash flow from ops is right on track. We continue to believe for the full-year, cash flow from ops will range between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. And so we feel good about where the company is positioned on that. I think as the company continues to see some growth in earnings, we\u2019ll see that growth in cash flow operations as well.","Samuel Hazen","So our original guidance was $6.5 billion to $7 billion\u2026","William Rutherford","$6.5 billion to $7 billion, yes, and we really continue to believe that\u2019s the proper guidance for HCA.","Samuel Hazen","Correct. Okay. Scott, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Samuel Hazen","Steve?","Operator","Mr. Valiquette, we aren\u2019t able to hear you. Please check your mute function. Again, sir, please check your mute function, we aren\u2019t able to hear you.","Steven Valiquette","Hello.","William Rutherford","Hey, Steve.","Steven Valiquette","Hey, sorry [indiscernible] and I turned on the cellphone. I hope, you can hear me.","Samuel Hazen","Yes, go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","I just want to follow-up. Okay. So just separate from the surgery discussion earlier, there has been discussion this quarter among your peers softer same-store revs per adjusted admission that maybe happening for other reasons as well that you guys obviously had pretty good results in 1Q 2019 on that metric and now there\u2019s a ton of variables that go into that metric.","But I\u2019m just wondering if you are able to comment on the durability of your results there just for the rest of 2019 just to give investors more confidence around, again, this same-store revs per adjusted admission metric for HCA for the full-year? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","Thanks, Steve. I think, obviously, we benefit from commercial volume growth, and our commercial volume growth, like I said, we\u2019ve had six consecutive quarters of adjusted admission growth in our Commercial segment and that yielded strong revenue per adjusted admission.","The second thing I would say is, as we build out service line capability and deepen our programs broadly across the organization, that yields more revenue per patient Those are the two factors that drove our revenue per unit up above where maybe people expected. And we\u2019ve had a pretty good pattern with that. I think in 2018, if I remember correctly, we were north of 3%, and that again is a function of those two variables.","Also when you look at our case mix, our case mix trends, which is not a perfect proxy for acuity, but a good one is actually trending north of 3% as well. So we continue to invest in both of those components of our business. We have numerous initiatives that are geared toward being more accessible for the commercial population. We have more outpatient investments that are geared towards that.","Also, in the service line standpoint, we continue to build out capabilities across the company\u2019s portfolio. And again, those things still think have room to grow. And as we see continued momentum in the markets with job growth and strong economies, we think that portends reasonably well for us over the course of 2019.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. I appreciate your best color. Thanks.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Actually was \u2013 I wanted to follow-up on that one. I guess, the quarter itself was quite good. Clearly, the commentary is very bullish. And so I guess the question would be, is there anything that could potentially move you back into the guidance range on revenue per adjusted admit that\u2019s 2 to 3 for the year? Does it seem like pretty likely to be tracking above?","William Rutherford","Well, we\u2019ll have to see. There\u2019s obviously quarter-to-quarter trends we have. But as you\u2019ve heard us talk about, we feel there\u2019s a lot of momentum in the growth prospects of the company. As Sam just mentioned, good commercial growth really helps drive that. We continue to invest in higher acuity services.","So, we do anticipate continued strength in the revenue portfolio and the composition of the company. So I think for the near-term, we might be above that, but we\u2019ll just have to see what the future quarters yield.","Steve Tanal","Appreciate that. And maybe just lastly, from anything just on the M&A pipeline, any comments there? How was that looking? Are there still opportunities out there? Have you slowed the pace? Any color would be helpful? Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thanks, Steve.","William Rutherford","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have anything to report on at this particular point in time. It\u2019s our judgment. And I mentioned this, I think, on the last call or maybe the call before that, we could be entering a cycle where there are some nice opportunities for the company.","We are having discussions, but they\u2019re early discussions with different systems that are exploring their options as they look at their future and their situation. Most of those are independent not-for-profit systems that we think have some appeal. And so we will continue those conversations to say that there are any more than we\u2019ve had in the past, I really can\u2019t say that. But I do think we are entering a period of time, where we could see more than we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Steve Tanal","Great. Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Anagha Gupte with SVB Leerink.","Anagha Gupte","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So very impressive quarter. You continue to impress and you decouple from the rest of the hospital operators on growth and all the metrics. So, my questions are really about how much of this is even secular anymore relative to the HCA playbook? And I can ask many, but two quick ones would be your commercial mix has been very impressive. You had once, I think, a year ago maybe talked about market specific population growth probably in a better employment in your markets. Is that anymore, or is it just shaking, because you\u2019re investing so well in service lines and I mean, all of that and with your physicians?","And then secondly, on the pricing growth, also, the rates in the payer mix and acuity, but you\u2019re much better than everyone else. And is it also, because you have an unparalleled asset base across the inpatient assets, your 2000-plus sort of access points that you\u2019re buildings towards? So you have the ability to optimize your payer mix and your acuity by sight of service, if you will, any comments on that?","Samuel Hazen","All right. Thank you, Anagha.","William Rutherford","I\u2019m not in a position to speak to the other companies and their results. What I can speak to is how we approach the market and what it takes for us to compete in these large metropolitan markets. And typically, we are competing against a local not-for-profit system or to most of which are only in that particular market, very few of them are what I would call portfolio market players.","So we have to adjust our approach to deal with those local nuances. But we have been very effective in transporting ideas, transporting initiatives and investing aggressively in our growth agenda across the company. And our results are broad based. Our market share on the commercial is at an all-time high. We grew our market share on the commercial book actually slightly better than we grew our overall market share in the in this last report that we\u2019ve got, so that\u2019s very encouraging.","We continue to believe we\u2019re doing the right things, again, from a payer standpoint and relating to them and finding ways to be a solution for them and at the same time creating an efficient and satisfying experience for the patient. So a lot of our commercial revenue is on the outpatient side. We invest in that. We try to create programs that make it easy for the patients to navigate. And so, we\u2019ll continue down that pathway, because we think it works. And so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s hard for me to compare against the other companies, because I don\u2019t get to see their results like I do ours nor do I understand their business model to the same degree, as I understand our competitors across our markets.","Mark Kimbrough","All right. Thank you, Anagha.","Anagha Gupte","Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll hear now from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. Just two question on the trend in your services and the demographics. As you look at the weighting towards cardiac services this quarter and, on the other hand, the fewer C-sections that you had. Is that \u2013 are we talking aging of the population on the one hand and the very, very low birth rate on the other? And I\u2019m just curious how you see that developing, given that the vanguard of the baby boom generation is now in the early 70s.","Samuel Hazen","So there\u2019s two pieces. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. There are two pieces to that question. On the cardiac side, we have seen strong cardiology volume trends even in the fourth quarter, I think, we were up about 5%.","And so we\u2019re up again about that same level, and that really goes to our service line strategy, which is led by a team up here in Nashville, who supports our field teams in physician recruitment, program development, technology, deployment, patient navigation, all of those kind of things, and we think that has allowed us to attract physician talent and add program capacity and that\u2019s yielding volume gains for us across the board in cardiology.","In the obstetrics world, what\u2019s interesting in this quarter, our commercial obstetrics volume was up about 6%. Our Medicaid volume was down significantly. And so that\u2019s what drove sort of the overall blend of the metrics and yielded some reductions in C-section. We do see birth rates flattening out across the country. We\u2019ve spoken to that before.","And our approach to women services has been to really create destination sites in most of our markets, where physicians and moms want to go, because we have the facilities, the physician capability, the nursing capability and so forth that creates a very positive environment. And that\u2019s working for us in markets, where we\u2019ve made those investments. And we\u2019ll continue to look at, again, transporting that idea more broadly, so that we can pick up market share.","I think for the most recent report, our market share in obstetrics is actually flat, but that where we\u2019ve lost it is again in the Medicaid side of the equation and not so much on the commercial side.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","Thanks, Matt. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Jesse Klink","All right. This is Jesse on for Sarah. Thanks for taking the question. So on the last call, you highlighted that 80% of hospitals grew even, say, year-over-year, 70% for admissions year-over-year, 65% of hospitals grew outpatient surgery year-over-year. So all in 2018 was really good year. Just wondering how that\u2019s trending so far in 2019? If it makes a difficult comp at all, do you still think there\u2019s room for improvement among those facilities? And then if there is room for improvement, just what could that mean for the kind of 2% to 3% volume growth and 4% to 6% EBIT growth guidance? Thanks.","William Rutherford","Well, we had a really strong portfolio performance again in the first quarter of 2019. It was very similar to the metrics that you just delineated. We had 75% of our hospitals that had year-over-year EBITDA growth. We had 54% have admission growth. Now some of that is because of the flu season and the impact that the flu season last year had on our year-over-year comparisons. But nonetheless, that\u2019s a pretty powerful metric in my judgment given that we had one less business calendar day or one less business day and then we had the impact of the flu from the previous year.","Emergency room volume was a little softer than what I recorded \u2013 reported last year and, again, I think that\u2019s due to the flu. But all in all, we had a really strong portfolio performance pretty much across the Board, so we\u2019re very pleased with the execution of our strategies by our management teams across the Board.","Samuel Hazen","Okay, great. Thank you. Hey, Cody, we\u2019ve got time for two more questions, okay?","Operator","Absolutely. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Sam, I guess my question for you. As I think about your physician strategy, are you looking at piloting or pursuing any new approaches to in-hospital physician practice ownership? And then, again, as we think about the M&A pipeline, how does that relate to that in terms of your appetite for acquiring in-hospital practices at this point?","Samuel Hazen","Well, we continue to add to our physician services group physician practices. I think, we\u2019re over 5,000 physician practices in \u2013 or 5,000 physicians roughly 1,200, 1,400 clinics across the company, and that\u2019s growing it roughly 8% to 10% per year. So that\u2019s an ongoing trend that we think is part of our success, but at the same time part of creating an offering for our patients and for our payers that works.","As it relates to hospital-based physicians, specifically, we are exploring approaches to deal with some of the pressures that exist in the marketplace. We have today hospital-based physician practices that are owned by HCA. For critical care medicine, we may have the largest or the second largest critical care medicine practice in the country. We also have a very large pathology practice inside of HCA that\u2019s growing.","We are exploring hospital as we\u2019re exploring emergency room physicians. We\u2019re exploring anesthesia in ways that are maybe different than what we\u2019ve done in the past. We don\u2019t have anything today to report as to exactly what that\u2019s going to be. How that will impact acquisitions in the futures? I don\u2019t think it will be a material impact on any acquisitions. It could be synergistic on the margins for some acquisitions in the future if we do have a different approach there. But at this point in time, it\u2019s not really that material.","Brian Tanquilut","All right. Thank you.","Mark Kimbrough","Thank you, Brian. We\u2019ve got one more.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our follow-up from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the follow-up here. Quick question, case mix, I guess, quantify that increasing at 3% in the first quarter? Did you disclose the same-store case mix? And also it\u2019s increasing over the past three years and mostly due to our CapEx investments. With the amount of CapEx spend in the process, is it fair to think the case mix growth shouldn\u2019t slow anytime in the next two to three years?","William Rutherford","Yes, Peter, this is Bill. Our case mix index for the first quarter was 2.6%...","Samuel Hazen","Same facility\u2026","William Rutherford","\u2026on a same facility basis on there, a lot of service line variables on there. I don\u2019t know whether it will slow or not as we\u2019ve talked about our focus, both from capital as well as the program development, Sam has alluded to throughout the call, is to continue to grow our high acuity and high intensity services.","So, we\u2019ve been in a period where we\u2019ve been north of that for some period of time in this 3 to 4. I said before, 2 to 3 likely might be a long-term settlement \u2013 settle period. But as we continue to invest capital in the high acuity, as our program development is focused on the high acuity, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we still see a robust case mix index for us.","Pito Chickering","Thank you very much.","William Rutherford","Okay. Cody?","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kimbrough for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Kimbrough","Okay, great. Listen, I want to thank, everyone, who participated today. Thanks for your interest in HCA, and I\u2019ll be around the office if you need any additional follow-up. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"10866":["HCA Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) Q1 2015 Earnings Call May  5, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Victor L.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Charlotte. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning, as usual, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. I trust most of you have had the opportunity to review our full quarterly earnings release issued this morning, which is consistent with the company's April 15th preview for the quarter. I will make a few remarks, then turn the call over to Sam and Bill to provide more detail on the quarter's results.","We were extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. The quarter's performance was once again highlighted by strong volume trends, favorable payer mix and excellent expense management. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 19.3% to $1.961 billion compared to $1.644 billion in last year's first quarter.","If you adjust the quarter's performance for electronic health record incentive income and share based compensation, adjusted EBITDA increased 20.6% over the prior year. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, excluding gains on sales of facilities and legal claims cost, increased 53%. And diluted earnings per share increased 60.7% over the prior year's first quarter. The same-facility admissions increased 5.1% and adjusted admissions increased 6.8% over the prior year's first quarter. This is the largest year-over-year quarterly volume growth rate in the company's last 10 years. The growth was broad-based across markets and service lines.","Our same-facility ER volumes remain robust, increasing 11.5% over the prior year, while surgical volumes also reflect solid growth over the prior year. With respect to health reform, as expected, we saw increasing levels of exchange volumes during the quarter. Bill will provide additional details in a moment.","Due to the strength of the quarter and our revised outlook for the year, we have raised our guidance ranges for 2015. We believe revenues should now range between $39 billion to $40 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $7.55 billion and $7.85 billion and earnings per share should range between $4.90 and $5.30 per share. There are a number of assumptions embedded in our guidance that are included in our release this morning and I would encourage you to review them.","We had another strong cash flow quarter with cash flows from operating activities increasing to $1.018 billion compared to $443 million in last year's first quarter. As I stated in last quarter's earnings call, one of our key strengths is our ability to create shareholder value through capital deployment. We deployed approximately $446 million in capital spending back into our markets and also used approximately $366 million to repurchase approximately 5.2 million shares of our common stock.","As of April 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 10.6 million shares of our stock, including 3.8 million shares from Bain Capital, and have expended approximately $781 million of the $1 billion authorization from February 2015.","As noted in our release this morning, we announced that the board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Also, as noted in our release this morning, we plan to increase our capital spend during the next three years by $500 million to $7.7 billion. The additional capital spend will allow us to expand our service capabilities to meet increasing market demand. Sam will discuss this in more detail in a moment.","We continue to advance our patient safety, quality of care, and patient experience objectives. Our focus is to continue to strengthen our delivery system capabilities and I believe we are strategically positioning the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.","And finally, I would like to congratulate Dr. Jonathan Perlin, our President of Clinical Services and our CMO, as he assumes the Chairman role of the American Hospital Association. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. Good morning, everybody. As Milton indicated, we had a strong quarter driven by strong volume growth and excellent expense management. So I'll give you some more detail on our performance and then discuss our health reform trends.","As we reported, in the first quarter, same-facility admissions increased 5.1% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 6.8%. We will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class.","During the first quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.9% and 6.8% respectively. This does include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 14.3% on a same-facility basis and now represent 32.2% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 10.6% and 13.9% respectively in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends. We continue to see strength in our six expansion states but also have seen strength in our non-expansion states as well, and I'll provide some additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform comments.","Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 12.5% in the quarter while equivalent admissions increased 5.1%. These represent 6.3% of our total admissions compared to 7.6% last year and continue to trend favorably for the company.","Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, increased 5.8%, and equivalent admissions increased 7.7% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.5% in the quarter compared with prior year and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 22% last year.","Intensity of service or acuity moderately increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 26% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 2% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 3% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% from the prior year.","Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.6% in the quarter. This was softer than our recent trends. Currency translation rates for our international division and Texas Waiver revenues impacted our reported number.","Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations, excluding Waiver revenues, increased 2.1% over the prior year. Our outpatient revenue as a percent of total was 37.7% versus 36.9% in the prior year and that also diluted NRAA (09:41) slightly.","Same-facility managed care and other, including exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.3% in the quarter. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $175 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $887 million, a decline of $37 million from the prior period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.507 billion, an increase of $212 million over the prior-year period.","Now, turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was excellent and we were able to leverage strong volumes. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission declined 0.7% compared to last year's first quarter, and this led to an improvement of 170 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter to 20.3%. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues improved by 40 basis points to 45.5% compared to 45.9% in last year's first quarter.","Salaries per equivalent admission increased 0.4% in the quarter on a same-facility basis, leveraging our strong volume in the quarter. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 0.6% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period, an improvement of 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's first quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives.","Other operating expenses improved 90 basis points from last year's first quarter to 17.7% of revenues. We did recognize $19 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $30 million last year, and that's consistent with our expectations. As previously mentioned, our as-reported adjusted EBITDA margins increased 170 basis points, and adjusting for EHR incentive income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points over prior year for the quarter.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another extremely strong quarter with cash flow from operations increasing to $1.018 billion at the end of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.587 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times at March 31, 2015, compared to 3.96 at the end of 2014 and 4.35 at the end of the first quarter of 2014.","So, let me spend a minute talking about health reform. Health reform activity was strong for the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 9,880 exchange admissions as compared to the 1,600 we saw in the first quarter of last year. You may recall, we saw about 7,700 exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2014, or a 28% increase quarter-to-quarter. And we believe this is largely due to the new enrollment. We saw approximately 37,000 exchange ER visits in the first quarter, compared with the 4,000 in the first quarter of 2014 and the 26,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","We have history on about 50% of our quarter one exchange volume and based on our look back at previous coverage, we estimate about 40% of need admissions were uninsured to prior to health reform. Given this is the second year of reform, we are also tracking what the coverage was in 2014. Based on the exchange patients where we have 2014 experience, 36% were previously covered under a HIX product, 39% were covered by another insurance product, and 25% were uninsured in 2014. We will continue to evaluate these metrics throughout the year.","In our six Medicaid expansion states, our trends in the first quarter were consistent with what we saw in the second half of 2014. In these states, uninsured admissions were down 59% compared to the first quarter of 2014, and Medicaid admissions were up 31% in the expansion states. For reference, in our non-expansion states, same-store uninsured admissions were down 8.2% and Medicaid admissions were up 7.2%. When we roll all of the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just over 5% of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and in line with our expectations for the quarter.","So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was strong in the quarter, and it continued to accelerate compared to the previous four quarters in 2014. As I stated in my fourth quarter comments, we believe this performance reflects improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets. And we also believe it reflects market share gains which have been driven by a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda by our operating teams and capital spending that has been invested both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. There were no unusual factors that contributed to the quarter's accelerated growth.","Admissions with a flu-related diagnosis were up, but the overall effect on volume growth is minimal. Growth in volume was once again broad-based across most of the company's markets, and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter, all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, growth in adjusted admissions, and growth in emergency room visits. All but one division had growth in both managed care and exchange admissions and adjusted admissions.","For the company, managed care and exchange ER visits grew by 13.4%. All divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these two payer classes. All but two divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 26.6% of total admissions for the quarter, down slightly from 27.2% in the first quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the 8th straight quarter where we have had growth in inpatient surgeries.","Nine divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries, which were up 1.7% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in seven out of the last eight quarters. Our ambulatory surgery division also had growth in the quarter. Surgeries in this division were up almost 1%. Most service lines had some level of surgical growth with notable growth in orthopedic, cardiovascular and neurosurgery.","Outpatient revenue for the company grew by almost 12% in the quarter and represented 37.7% of total patient revenues. Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 3.1% with 10 divisions showing growth. Managed care and exchange delivery were up almost 8%, 11 divisions had growth in these payer classes.","Neonatal admissions grew 7.3%, behavioral health admissions were up 11.7%, rehab admissions were up 14.1%, and average length of stay grew by 1%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions.","Market share trends for the company for the 12-month period ended September 2014 were generally consistent with past trends. Market share grew by 13 basis points to above 24%, approximately 65% of our markets increased share across most service lines. Of particular note was the rebound in overall inpatient demand which increased in the third quarter across HCA markets by slightly over 2%. Commercial demand was even more notable with an increase of over 6%. We believe demand in both the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 were equally strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available.","HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving sustainable market share gains and overall results. We continue to invest in our local markets at significant levels but occupancy and utilization levels have grown to the point where we need to increase our capital spending to maintain the capacity for future growth.","Bed occupancy levels have grown to over 70% of operating beds and in many fast-growing markets, they are running at even higher levels. ER bed utilization, even with the significant investments we have made over the past few years to add capacity in this service line, has grown by 7% and is now over 85%.","The anticipated increase in capital spending that we announced will provide over the next few years more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity, enhance service line offering and add necessary equipment for our nurses and surgeons.","In certain markets, capital spending will be deployed for new hospitals and new outpatient facilities. Many of our projects have a lead time that requires us to get started soon to address these capacity constraints.","And finally, managed care and exchange contracting continue to progress as planned. The company is currently contracted for almost 95% of its revenue for 2015, 65% of its revenue for 2016 and 45% of its revenue for 2017. The pricing terms and the non-pricing terms of these contracts are generally consistent with the previous year's terms.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam, thank you. Charlotte, if you could come back on and poll for questions, and I would ask that everyone limit your questions to one, so we can give everybody an opportunity.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Again, we would ask that you limit yourself to one question. We'll have our first question from Matthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. In light of the strength of results, I want to ask, if you can touch on it, what you saw over the course of the quarter, if there's any granularity you can give us on the three months as they developed, perhaps any impact that you saw from the weather, although I know that was pretty northeast-centric? And then anything at all you can say about what you've seen in April?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Matt, thank you. Sam Hazen. I can tell you right now we don't touch on April. We stay with the quarter, but Sam will take the rest.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","You have to, in any particular quarter, consider the business day complement within each of the months. And I want to say we had a headwind in January and a tailwind in March with respect to the calendar as far as business days are concerned. And so, that influenced each of the months accordingly.","Nonetheless, in each of the three months, we had pretty solid volume growth, if I remember correctly, across most of our metrics, March was clearly the best month for the quarter because of the size of the month, number of business days that we had, and so forth. And I think from that standpoint, we had a pretty steady performance throughout the quarter, with a little bit of acceleration in the month of March given the calendar benefit.","As it pertains to weather, we did have weather in a number of our markets in Texas, and also in Tennessee, in Kansas City. But those tended to wash out, I think, reasonably well in the quarter and really did not have any kind of material impact on the volumes.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Matt, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Clearly, very strong results. So, I'm just curious, with the strength in the volume and the growth in the economy, are you seeing any wage pressure, are you planning on that in light of all the growth that you're seeing? And then, with this capital deployment you're putting in place, accelerating that, and with the buyback, would that necessarily preclude you from the M&A market? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, you want to address wage and Bill will take the other one?","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","We have had in certain markets, where the economy has historically been a little bit better, seen some level of wage pressure. We've been able to deal with that on the fly, if you will. And we've adjusted certain compensation programs and so forth to give ourselves capacity to address some of those challenges. We are benefiting over the last few years from a relatively low inflationary environment and we are considering that in evaluating what we can do to prepare ourselves for possibly some level of inflation over time. I do think it will happen from one market to the other. It won't happen in one big step across the whole organization.","Having said that, in the first quarter, we did have a higher level of contract labor utilization than we typically have but we attributed most of that to the increased levels of volume that we saw in the quarter and we had to staff that at some level with additional contract head count. We think that will normalize as the volumes normalize over the course of the year. But from that standpoint, Frank, we are not considering any short-term pressures with wages that are going to create a problem for us.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","And Milton?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On the capital deployment strategy, Frank, we've been saying now really for a number of years that we have a diversified strategy with respect to capital deployment. We always try to be optimistic with how we deploy capital. So this quarter makes a really good example, where we're stepping up our capital spend, as Sam described, in many of our markets to meet anticipated demand in those markets. At the same time, another $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And again, we will continue to look for acquisitions that fit our profile.","Our balance sheet today, the leverage ratio is the lowest point it's been since we entered the LBO in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our cash flow is as strong as it's been, I think, in the history of the company. So, we've gained financial flexibility. And so we will continue to deploy capital in a way that we think will maximize shareholder value and shareholder returns, at the same time with a view towards continuing to invest in our business for the long term. And in the markets that we're in, of course, we're seeing a lot of good opportunities and improving macroeconomic conditions as well and all that contributes in our change in outlook relative to how much capital we plan to deploy in these markets. But we don't think that any of these steps relative to share repurchase nor the additional capital spend in any way reducing our flexibility to be acquisitive if we have the opportunity.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Frank.","Operator","We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe, Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I just wanted to come back to that point. So you mentioned debt to EBITDA down, I think, 3.8 times. I think historically, you've talked about being comfortable in kind of the 4 times and 4.5 times range. So I guess at this point, how should we think about your appetite to lever up a bit, maybe talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline?","And then just along those lines, there seems to be more interest in JVs or partnerships out there among hospitals. Is this something that you all are interested in or maybe has that been a hurdle as to why maybe we haven't seen larger system sales to this point? Thanks.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Milt. Let me touch a little bit of that, then maybe Bill Rutherford want to comment on it as well. Ralph, we're actively looking for the right acquisition opportunities for HCA. We do have a profile that we're looking for and potentially moving into new markets, for example, or expanding in our existing markets. That's been more, of course, what we've been doing recent years is more what we call a tuck-in acquisition. Those are the ones that \u2013 again, we like those as well, but they tend to be smaller as far as relative to HCA as a total company.","But we're always looking for right opportunities. We potentially have transactions in some phase of development. Many times though, obviously in the last year, they haven't moved to closure. But we're continuing to look. We think that we have a lot to offer to a strategic player out there relative to bringing our size and scale to the marketplace and some of our operating capabilities as well.","So we will continue to be interested. As I've said many times over the recent years, it's just very hard to predict when those opportunities will come. They tend to come and go at a pace that's hard for us necessarily to manage. We would also be interested in joint venture opportunities. When we meet with a strategic player about a potential transaction, it doesn't always have to be 100% acquisition. We would consider partnerships. As you know, we operate several significant partnerships in our portfolio in some major markets. So we have a lot of experience with success in doing that, and we would continue to have that as an option if, in fact, we had a willing partner who wanted to move in that direction.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Bill, you want to...","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Speaking of balance sheet, Ralph, as we've said, our leverage target range is 3.5 times to 4.5 times. Given our size, a full turn's almost $7.5 billion. So that gives us a lot of flexibility within that range, plus considering we're sitting here at 3.8 times right now. I think if you look at opportunities in the marketplace, if the right opportunities came along, I think we've got plenty of flexibility to operate within that range to lever up if the right opportunity came up.","Our acquisition pipeline still is active in the outpatient area and kind of the other services that we remain active on, growing those outpatients. You've seen us do acquisitions of a smaller size even last year. So I think our balance sheet is really strong, gives us a lot of flexibility. And given our stated ranges and given our size, I think we've got plenty of capital capacity to execute on a variety of market opportunities.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Ralph.","Operator","We'll go next to Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. This is Josh Kalenderian in for Darren. Thanks for taking the question.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sure.","Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to ask you guys what the company's contingency plans are in the event that the Supreme Court sides with King. And then related to that, hoping you can give us the approximate exposure on a run rate basis to the ACA benefit from exchanges, and how much of that is in federal marketplace? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you. Milt, you want to lead off just on the SCOTUS comment?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, one thing about our operating strategies that we're investing in, these strategies are effective either in an exchange product, a reform environment, or what I would call our core environment. They're effective either way. So, I don't see any significant change in our operating strategy at all, if the Supreme Court decision rules against the government. Now, as a contingency plan, we always look at opportunities to react to the marketplace. But quite frankly, again, our main operating strategy is we're going to be effective either in a reform environment or not.","Now, I think that with respect to the Washington aspect, and we're very active. And Vic, of course, is head of our government relations, we're very active in Washington. We would work very, very hard in Washington to lobby for some sort of other program if in fact \u2013 or some sort of transition plan. So, a number of things we'd be doing in Washington as a contingency plan. But as you know, I'm not going to tell you that we can certainly predict the outcome of what's going to happen in Washington. But we certainly would be very active as we are today in terms of getting our voice heard by the decision makers in Washington.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","And I guess I'd add to that \u2013 this is Vic \u2013 that almost weekly, when I go to D.C., I see more and more concern about individuals losing these subsidies in these states. And whether you're talking to Democrats or the Republicans, I think there's a strong belief we can't lose these subsidies.","And the other thing that you're seeing is that they're looking at a longer period of time to try to keep the subsidies in place. We don't know what the Supreme Court would rule if it goes the other way. But I think the belief is by most members of Congress is that this has to be extended for some length of time to allow those people to keep those subsidies.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll just add on just a couple other points and just remind you that our exchange admissions are basically 2% of total HCA admissions. If I go by just state enrollment trends, about 75% to 80% of our states are in federally-run exchanges with 20% to 25% in state-run exchanges, in response to your question.","And then as we indicated in my comments, we're estimating that reform contributed about 5% of adjusted EBITDA for the company in the first quarter, go north of that for the balance of the year as it progresses. So I think, back to Milton's point, the core business and core HCA operation still remains very strong.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Darren (sic) [Josh] (32:58), thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just following up on the comment you mentioned some of the strength earlier. Would you be able to perhaps give some additional anecdotal indications of how your economically sensitive volumes are progressing? I mean, you noted orthopedics earlier and trends in obstetrics, et cetera, and then any geographic variations like Texas that are worth calling out relative to the rest of the portfolio.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Andrew, thank you. Sam, you want to.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Yeah. It's very hard to sit here and attribute a certain component of volume to one thing or the other, but using commercial demand from our market share analysis as the proxy for overall economic health, and the best metric for that is the third quarter of 2014 where commercial demand across all of HCA's 42 markets was up 6%. That was fairly broad-based. We have some markets that are better than that and some markets that are slightly worse than that.","So when I look at the first quarter and I look at our commercial volumes across the various service lines and compare it to the third quarter, they're very similar. So it would suggest similar commercial demand growth overall, and we'll get that data sometime in the next four months to five months. I'll be able to report that out and verify that conclusion.","But specific to Texas, Texas in overall metrics across the eight markets where we do business in Texas were generally consistent with the rest of the company when it comes to top line activity and when it comes to payer mix activity. So there weren't any noticeable headwinds in Texas. We did pay particular attention to Houston, given the energy economy there. And again, HCA had pretty strong performance from a top line standpoint in the market, Houston by itself.","I look at obstetric demand which was up by, what'd I say, double digits. Commercial emergency room demand, very strong. And then, even in our physician practices, we saw a slight improvement in our payer mix, again, I think, reflecting some of the volume and some of the dynamics within our marketplace.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick, Mizuho.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you very much. I'm going to ask a question that I'm not sure you're going to be able to answer, but when I look at your margin, I mean, I get the scale, I get the argument of the density and the clustering and all the things that you do right. So I understand that. But your margins are whole lot better than everyone else's. So, A, congratulations, good job; B, please keep it up; and, C, how do you keep it up? Is it through the pricing or are there things that you're able to do and accomplish that others can't that you can attribute some portion of this?","I mean, you have to have looked at it at some point I would imagine because it is noticeable, it is striking and, of course, it's what drives that superlative cash flow that we talk about. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sheryl, thank you for the question. Sam is really smiling over here. He obviously is doing a great job but there are a lot of things he can talk about.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Well, I think, Sheryl, when I look at the company, I can't speak to the dynamics particularly inside of all the other companies and what their margins are because we have some variation within our portfolio of hospitals as you can imagine. I will say it's fairly tight when it comes to high performance, low performance and then clusterings around the mean.","The thing I think that we believe is driving margin production inside of HCA, you mentioned scale. We do believe leveraging the scale and continuing to find ways to leverage our scale both on making our business better with respect to quality, efficiency, patient experience, all those kind of things are very helpful in the discussion here and then finding ways, again, to take out administrative cost. We're able to do that.","The other thing that I think is important to the company from a margin standpoint is we do have a growing complexity of services that we offer and, typically speaking, more complicated service offerings will generate higher margins. And if you put that on fixed cost base like our hospitals have, the operating leverage that comes from that is very powerful.","So we've been very intentional over the past four years or five years to add more complexity to our facility offering. And in most of our markets make sure we can offer pretty much any service to any patient that needs care.","So if they hit an HCA system as an outpatient or in a physician practice somewhere, how do we keep that patient in the system by having a full complement of services. That has helped us on the margin. The third thing is we have been able to maintain our competitive position which has allowed us to get reasonable reimbursement increases from our payers and that's helpful, obviously, from a margin standpoint.","And then the fourth thing I would mention is that we have been intentional about our efforts to grow our commercial market share and put ourselves in a potion to generate margin from that particular segment. And I think gain, coupling our service line offerings, our capital deployment, our outreach strategy and focus it specifically on the commercial segment has allowed us to generate healthy margins for the company. And so, those are some of the things that we focus on, those are some of the things that we're fairly intentional with as it relates to resource allocations, tactical approaches in certain markets and so forth.","And then the last thing, and I think this is a powerful and tangible asset for HCA and one that we're getting better at each and every year, is leveraging the learnings that we see across the various marketplaces. If we see a great physician strategy or we see a great outreach strategy or program strategy or quality initiative, whatever the case may be, bottling that up, finding a way to get it to the marketplace quickly is something we're getting better at. And I think we will continue to gain ground over the years, and that will also help us with our margin initiatives as well.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, thanks. Milt, do you want to add something?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think Sam described it very well. I was going to just reinforce his last comment around our ability to really identify best practices and then to move those across the company. I think we're \u2013 as Sam said, we're more effective at doing that today than we've ever been in terms of getting these best practices implemented across different markets.","And then I'll just also just have to say to our teams, across our divisions and our groups and Sam, it's the ability to execute it. We have a team that really understands execution and accountability. And right now, there's just a lot of momentum in the organization. And I think we're seeing our teams really execute on our agenda across the board, and that's helping drive the top line and, of course, contributing to the margin expansion as well.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sheryl, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin, Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Question on the broad topic of maybe value-based reimbursement or risk taking and maybe even as far as provider, sponsors, health plans. Seems like there's been a lot more movement in maybe the non-for-profit world around some of that. I'm curious what sort of exposure HCA has with some of those arrangements and broadly what your thoughts are on the company's ability or even desire to take risk or share risk or in some way get paid on value as opposed to fee-for-service.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Milt, do want to lead off on that?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me maybe take the last part of that question, then go back to the value equation, but we're \u2013 as a company, we're not looking to move and to take risk. We don't see that right now in the intermediate term as something that we need to do. Now, do we have markets where we are taking a certain amount of risk that's not material to the company. Sure. We have pilots going on. We have experiments going on across all different revenue models from the (41:49) payments from shared savings program, pay for performance programs. We have in Tampa a physician group with full risk of about 35,000 lives.","So we have some things going on that allow us to see the marketplace, but in the aggregate, those are not material to HCA's operations at this point in time and with also a sense of urgency that we need to move that way. I know some in the industry may see that differently, but that's where we see it.","Now, with respect to value, and we talk a lot in our organization about healthcare and the value that we need to bring to our markets. And we see right now, our value as being turned by including, number one, patient safety, patient quality, patient experience, access points, so that it makes our system accessible, easy to get into, easy to access from a patient standpoint, from a physician standpoint, from the standpoint of bringing capability that Sam talked about in terms of being able to take care of any patient's needs from basic care to some of the more complex acute care that they may need in the marketplace.","So if we can deliver high-quality, and we're efficient as an operator and have the right access points, we see all those factors contributing to real value to patients and values to employers, value to payers. And that's what we're focused on. That's what we're executing today. That's our agenda. And then, we'll keep an eye on the marketplace and watch how this risk revenue model plays out, but we're looking at 42 different markets across HCA, all markets are a little bit different, but we're certainly not feeling any pressure to have to move our revenue to a risk model here anytime soon.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Josh, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question here. So you raised the guidance with Q1, obviously a very strong quarter, but can you just maybe flesh out the biggest variance in terms of why you're so confident early in the year to raise it? And then on the guidance, where you stand in terms of the same-store adjusted admission, 2% to 3% you gave before and pricing of 2 to 4 (44:10), you gave before as well? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you very much. Bill, you want that one?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll do it. Obviously, we finished 2014 very strong and we carried a lot of momentum into the first quarter of 2015. You don't always know how that momentum is going to carry across calendars, but given our really strong performance in the first quarter, felt really it was necessary to update our guidance. The majority of the updated guidance came from the strong performance in the first quarter but clearly our raise of almost $200 million of adjusted EBITDA factored in continuing momentum in the balance of the year. And so, we think, we really feel very confident in that revised guidance. It's largely continuing carrying the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014 into first quarter.","We're not revising really kind of our volume rate of guidance that we gave in February during our call. At this point in time, I think we still need some more quarters to get into detail. But given the strength of the first quarter performance, we thought it was necessary to up our guidance. And, in fact, if we hadn't and you implied the guidance for the balance of the year, it would have been relatively flattish year-over-year. So, we feel very confident with the momentum we've got right now, and that really is what led to the revised guidance in the release.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Joanna, Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte, Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the commentary you had about strong Medicare admissions and managed Medicare admissions. Is that likely just because there's more people in the system because of the aging boomers, or are you seeing something else in terms of inpatient authorizations?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it's both. As Sam mentioned in some of his comments, it's really hard to dissect kind of individual contributions. I think the overall company momentum contributed to that. Clearly, I think increasing enrollment in Medicare, more in the Medicare Advantage as well we're benefiting from. But kind of the other kind of marketplace dynamics are in the Medicare payer class as well as in our other payer classes. So, I think it's really a combination of a variety of factors that really go along with the volume drivers of our other core business.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Yeah. Bill, let me just add. We believe that Medicare business in general is not as economically dependent obviously as the commercial book. So the movement in Medicare is not going to be as pronounced as what we've seen on the commercial side of the equation. And so the aging of the baby boomers is going to continue to create opportunities for Medicare volume growth, and then gains in market share and program development and so forth are going to hopefully add additional volume opportunities for the company.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Ana, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Question for Sam, so as we think about this capital plan, are there any specific areas where you're expanding or is this just a general addition of inpatient beds and ER beds in hospitals. Or this more of a targeted approach to specific growth areas within your hospitals? Thanks.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Well, it's general in the sense that it will go to what produces revenue for the company which are the beds in the ERs and the surgical equipment, as you said. I'd like to think we're heavily targeted in how we deploy capital and we're looking at markets. Specifically, we're looking at facilities within those markets and then we're adding to the capability of those institutions. Where necessary, we're bringing new institutions into the marketplace. For example, over the past 18 months, 24 months, we've added 4 new hospitals. We've added numerous outpatient facilities to round out the convenience of our network for our patients so that it's easy for them to access an HCA system.","So it's going to be the same approach, just more of it because we have those kind of opportunities, we believe, in the marketplace to continue the programs, the effort and hopefully the sustainable growth that we've seen over the past few years.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Brian.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","And let me just add one thing there, we do have certain markets, as I mentioned in my call, Vic, where there are more pressing demand needs and more pressing capital needs. So the company will be focused on a handful of markets here or there. We haven't finalized that plan specifically yet. But we do see some opportunities specific to certain markets where there could be a little bit of an enhanced spend in those markets to really take advantage of the situation.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice, UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. I might just ask you about the supplemental programs in Florida and Texas. Obviously, there's an aspect of the Texas Medicaid Waiver that you're not currently booking. Can you just comment on whether there's been anything behind the scenes there, discussions and whether you're actually getting the money, just not booking it? And then more broadly, there's certainly been discussions about the back and forth between CMS in Florida about the low income pool and about the Texas General Medicaid Waiver. Can you give us your perspective there, and sort of size the exposure and what you think is going to happen, if anything?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thanks, A.J. Bill will take it.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, A.J., let me try to cover some of those. First, let me address kind of Texas Waiver. As we indicated at the end of last year, we plan on reducing our revenue recognition to the Texas Waiver. In the first quarter, we recognized about $77 million of Waiver revenues in Texas, compared to about $112 million in the first quarter of 2014. So, it was down $35 million which is really consistent with our expectations and I think the items we talked about last year. We understand CMS inquiry in Texas is continuing. We don't have anything new to report on there, and so we're still keeping our eye on it.","Clearly, a lot of discussion with various programs, whether they come under the form of provider tax, UPL, low income pool, kind of we understand that all of those are really approved and funded with CMS, either as a state plan amendment or a 115 Waiver program. And there's differentiating characteristics, as you know. The state plan amendments are not time limited. And generally, the state does not have to be asked to be to reapproved for those unless it modifies it's Medicaid program.","And then we got the 1115 Waiver programs which are time limited and states must ask for re-approval. And those are the issues in both Texas and Florida. The Florida has had a lot of publication on there. We receive about $75 million annually from the Florida (51:17) funding. We think it's really kind of early to talk about what might happen with these programs. With Texas, we know we have a Waiver that goes through 9\/30\/2016. All of these programs are extremely important for the safety net of the hospitals in those states and communities.","So we'll continue to keep our eye on what's going on between CMS and so forth. You think if there's programs at risk, it's in those 115 Waivers in those non-expansion states. And really that's Texas and Florida for us. Kansas and Tennessee are others, those are really the smaller programs on there. So we're going to keep our eye on it, and see where that flows, but we don't have anything new to report on Texas. And our revenue recognition's really in line with what we talked about last year until we get some more clarity on that.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, A.J.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.","Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. This is Ryan Halsted on for Gary. Just wanted to ask a question about the commercial contracting. As you're doing your contracts for 2016 and 2017, I'm just curious if you're seeing a move towards more narrowing of the networks? It seemed like 2015 was kind of a shift to a narrow network for you guys versus 2014 so I'm just curious if you're seeing or if you're contemplating potentially going further with narrowing the networks in the out years?","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Yeah. This is Sam. The short answer to the contracting provisions for 2016 and 2017 around narrow networks is they haven't really changed materially at all. On our core commercial contracts, there's hardly any changes with respect to that. Within the exchange component of our contracting, as we indicated at the end of 2014 in our first call for the fourth quarter of 2014, we have increased the number of exchange contracts for the company, I think, about 35% to 37%. And some of those did include a narrow network component, others didn't.","So, in global terms, there's not a lot of change at this particular point, and it looks as if our 2015, 2016 and 2017 contracting cycle is not going to have a lot of change. And we don't think it's in the best interest of the company to push that particular strategy in most situations. So I don't anticipate during the next 24-month to 30-month cycle any material changes.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Ryan. We've got time for one more question.","Operator","That will come from John Ransom, Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Can you hear me?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Yes, we sure can, John.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Just on the exchanges, you didn't contract with 40% or so of the plans. Did the out-of-network contribution from some of those members, has that been a material driver for you?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I want to say it was \u2013 hey, John. This is Bill. I'm not sure about 40%. We were really well represented, I think, with all but a couple of markets in first year reform. We did see some out of network in year one. As Sam mentioned, I think the increase in exchange contracts that we saw in year two addressed some of those.","So, I won't say it was material. We were seeing some out-of-network business in the reform in the exchange business in year one and year two. In several of those markets, we've gotten into the contracts in there. So, I won't classify it as it was a material driver for us, but it was a factor.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right.","William B.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Janine, thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you who are listening to our webcast. With me this morning as usual: our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And then we have several other members of our management team here today to assist in the Q&A, should we need them.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard, this morning's call is being recorded, replay will be available later today. With that, Richard Bracken.","Richard M. Bracken","All right. Thank you, Vic. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. Earlier this morning, the company reported its third quarter 2013 earnings results, which were consistent with the release we provided on October 17. Before our team provides additional details and analysis of the quarter, I'd like to start with a few general observations.","We were pleased with the results of the third quarter. Patient volumes for the third quarter, as expressed in same-facility admissions, increased 0.7% while same-facility adjusted admissions increased 1.1%. This volume growth was generally consistent with the trends we have experienced during the first 6 months of the year. Similar to the second quarter, in addition to volume growth, we were able to achieve favorable earnings performance through an improved service mix and continued efficiencies in our expense structure.","Revenues increased 4.9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% to $1.603 billion compared to the same period of the prior year. EBITDA operating margin for the quarter was 19%. Importantly, we believe that our growth strategies continue to position the company well. The underlying size and strength of our markets, our asset configurations, the expansion of service capacity and access points, a focus on quality care and patient service all supported by an appropriately sized capital spending plan have helped us achieve these favorable results.","Two important components of our growth agenda are to ensure patients have easy and convenient access to our networks and to assure that we have sufficient capacity to take care of patients in both an efficient and a safe environment. In part to accomplish this, we have increased capital spending and selectively acquired certain facilities, both hospitals and outpatient centers. Capital spending in 2012 and 2013 combined will approximate $3.8 billion with the majority of these expenditures going to improve access and increased capacity.","HCA has added over these past 2 years approximately 900 new inpatient beds, which includes 2 new hospitals. We have added over 200 new emergency room beds, both in our existing hospitals and in new sites off our main hospital campuses. We've added to our networks with strategic acquisitions. Again over the same period of time, 4 hospitals, 10 ambulatory surgical centers and 17 urgent care centers have been acquired to expand our networks. We believe our strategies will continue to position us well to accommodate market demand.","Last week, we announced that the company completed a $500 million share repurchase from our equity sponsors in conjunction with their secondary offering of 30 million shares. Our repurchase represents approximately 10.6 million shares and was funded through capacity under our revolving credit facilities. We expect this repurchase to be accretive to earnings.","Also last week, the Joint Commission released their list of top performing organizations. And I'd like to recognize those HCA hospitals that were recognized based on core measure performance data for 2012. HCA had 110, or 80%, of its licensed hospitals in the United States among those included as top performers on key quality measures. We believe this to be continuing confirmation of our operating team's dedication to clinical excellence.","And finally, regarding the ACA, we know you have a lot of questions about our contracting results and ACA enrollment outreach. And Milton will comment on these important issues in just a moment. But from a broader view, we, like most Americans, have been closely watching the rollout. The much-publicized issues with the federal website have not deterred our internal positioning. Fundamentally, we believe the most successful and sustainable strategies to participate efficiently over the long run in the ACA will be those that emphasize comprehensive patient access points, state-of-the-art and well-capitalized facilities and clinical technologies, a proven and transparent track record of providing high-quality care and service and the ability to leverage the cost structure to provide better value for the consumer.","These, of course, are the strategies that we've been working on for years. We feel confident that whatever turns might come regarding the ACA, we are well positioned to participate and provide quality health care services. And with that, I'll ask Milton to take the call.","R. Milton Johnson","Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all. First, let me introduce you to Bill Rutherford, our recently announced, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2014. Bill is here today and available to participate in the Q&A. I trust most of you had a chance to review our third quarter earnings release issued this morning, which was in line with our preview of the quarter. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions.","We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, which was the result of solid top line revenue growth and excellent expense management by our operating management teams. Revenues in the third quarter increased to $8.456 billion, up 4.9% compared to the prior year's third quarter, driven by both volume increases and revenue per unit growth. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.603 billion compared to $1.533 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%, consistent with the prior year's third quarter. However, adjusting for the reduction in our EHR incentive income, adjusted EBITDA margin would have exceeded the prior year's third quarter by 70 basis points.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $365 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared to $360 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. Overall, third quarter volume trends were generally consistent with our first 2 quarters of 2013 with same-facility admissions increasing 0.7% and same-facility equivalent admissions increasing 1.1% as compared to last year's third quarter. Our same-facility medical admissions increased 0.1%, while same-facility surgical admissions increased 1.8% compared to the prior year.","During the third quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Same-facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 9.6% on a same-facility basis and now represents 29.7% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year, while same-facility Medicaid equivalent admissions increased 0.8% compared to the prior year's third quarter.","In the third quarter, same-facility managed care and other admissions declined 1.1%, while same-facility managed care and others equivalent admissions declined 1.5% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, uninsured admissions increased 10.1% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior year. Same-facility uninsured admissions represent 8.8% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 8% in last year's third quarter.","Fairly consistent with the second quarter results, same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.9% in the quarter. Same-facility surgeries increased 1.3% in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.9% in our same-facility inpatient surgeries, while our same-facility outpatient surgeries increased 0.4% compared to the prior year. We were very pleased with our inpatient surgical growth rate of 2.9%. It is the highest growth rate for same-facility inpatient surgical growth since the third quarter of 2002.","During the third quarter, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.4% on a same-facility basis. This is primarily due to a 2% increase in our same-facility case mix, which is the measure of inpatient acuity. Same-facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 2.5% in the quarter, while Medicare case mix index increased 1.2% and helped to mitigate some of the impact of the sequester. Same-facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 1.4% and same-facility Medicaid case mix increased 3.5% over the prior year. Same-facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission reflected solid growth at 6.4% over the prior year period. Managed care and other case mix increased 3.4% over last year.","Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $252 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year. And during the third quarter, same-facility charity care discounts totaled $876 million, an increase of $68 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.084 billion, an increase of $184 million from the prior period.","Now moving to expenses. Our expense management trends remains favorable and consistent with the second quarter of this year. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to the prior year. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.3% on a same-facility basis. Same-facility productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission declined 0.3% over the prior year period. And same-facility wage rate growth was 2% in the third quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $7 million or 2.5% from the previous year's third quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter compared to last year's third quarter.","Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from a reduction of supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $40 million and contributed 300 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the third quarter. And the reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and we will anniversary this change in the fourth quarter of this year. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1% from the prior year period.","We recognized $75 million in electronic health record incentive income in the third quarter compared to $131 million in last year's third quarter. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $26 million and $24 million in EHR-related expense in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively.","Cash flows from operating activities totaled $900 million in the quarter, compared to $655 million last year. The $245 million increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $136 million and $51 million in lower income taxes. During the quarter, capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $451 million. Year-to-date capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $1.347 billion. And we invested $440 million in various acquisitions during the quarter. At September 30, 2013, the company's debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.39x compared to 4.41x at June 30, 2013. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.334 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","Before turning the call over to Sam, let me give you a brief update on exchange contracting for the Affordable Care Act. Approximately 152 of our 156 U.S. hospitals or 97% of our U.S. hospitals have an exchange contract with access to a bronze plan. Of the approximately 152 hospitals that have access to a bronze plan, approximately 93 hospitals are in the lowest or second-lowest bronze plan. Approximately 77 of our 156 U.S. hospitals have access to the lowest or second-lowest silver plans. It is our belief that network participation will evolve over time as we and others adjust to various market dynamics. But now let me turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter. 6 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in year-over-year same-facility inpatient admissions. The following divisions had strong growth in the quarter: East Florida, which includes Miami and surrounding markets; Far West, which includes California and Las Vegas; and TriStar, which includes Nashville. 10 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility adjusted admissions. Our London division had growth in both same-facility inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions. Overall, the growth inside our portfolio with domestic hospitals was comparable to the past 2 quarters. 54% of our domestic hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions and 55% had growth in adjusted admissions.","Emergency room volumes were not as strong in the quarter as compared to recent years. Although 8 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility emergency room visits, we had inconsistent patterns across the company with stronger growth in Florida, California and Nevada and softness in Texas, Utah and Virginia. We have seen a general weakness in the lower-acuity emergency room business. And there has been some increased competition in a number of markets. We feel these 2 factors are part of the reason for the slower growth rates. The company continues to invest significantly in its service lines to increase access and capacity, to improve operational efficiency and to enhance quality and service.","Total surgeries for the company on a same-facility basis were up 1.3% in the quarter with inpatient surgery volumes up 2.9%, hospital-based outpatient surgeries up 1.1% and our ambulatory surgery division down 0.5%. As you heard, this was a very strong quarter for surgical volumes. We believe that our efforts inside our surgical departments to improve our operations, clinical outcomes and surgeon satisfaction contributed to this growth in surgery volumes.","Inside our ambulatory surgery division, overall cases, which include certain endoscopic and pain management procedures that are not counted in our surgery volumes grew by 4.4% as a result of some recent acquisitions and new facility development. As indicated, acuity this past quarter was up. This increase was primarily driven by the strong inpatient surgical volumes. Same-facility surgical admissions accounted for 29% of total admissions, an increase of 40 basis points as compared to prior year. This is the first quarter in many quarters where growth in surgical admissions outpaced growth in medical admissions. Additionally, within the overall surgical business, we had strong growth in higher-acuity areas such as orthopedics, neurosurgery and cardiovascular surgery.","Same-facility behavioral service admissions were up 3.4% and acute rehabilitation admissions were up 8.5% in the quarter. These metrics are generally consistent with the first half of the year. And finally, same-facility deliveries were up 0.4%, which was similar to the first half of the year. Neonatal intensive care admissions were essentially flat for the quarter. However, overall neonatal patient days were down because of a drop in Medicaid patient days. Commercial patient days in our neonatal intensive care units increased slightly.","Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended March 2013. Once again, this is the most current data available for the company and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets. The company's inpatient market share during this period increased 54 basis points to 23.7%. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets during this period was essentially flat. This is a slight weakening from prior periods and reflects a weak first quarter in 2013. Inpatient demand across HCA markets in the first quarter declined by close to 0.9%. Again, we believe the calendar issues we discussed on our first quarter call explain the significant portion of this decline.","Sequentially, market share increased in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter. This is the seventh consecutive quarter the company has gained market share. We gained market share in 15 out of 17 service lines, which is a slight improvement as compared to our last report. HCA had market share gains in 28 out of 37 markets with growth in 8 out of our top 10 earnings markets. Market share in both the commercial and in-migration segments of our business grew, reflecting continued success with our outreach efforts in these 2 distinct markets. Across all of these metrics, the company's market share trends are generally consistent with past reports. This performance reflects solid execution of our growth agenda, which continues to evolve and continues to be resourced appropriately.","And finally, I would like to comment briefly on 3 exciting initiatives inside of HCA. The first one is the recent development of our clinical data warehouse. For many years, we have had access to clinical outcomes measures within our information systems, but we have not had good visibility into the information or transactions, if you will, that generated these outcomes. Now with our clinical data warehouse, we will be able to use this information in innovative ways to improve our quality outcomes, to eliminate inefficiencies in the process of delivering patient care and to find new ways to drive growth.","The second initiative is the rollout of our oneHR plan. Similar to other HCA shared services initiatives, this plan is designed to consolidate certain human resource functions that currently reside in our hospitals. By consolidating these functions into specialized centers, we should gain some cost synergies. But more importantly, we expect to improve our performance in recruitment, compensation management and education. These areas are critical to ensuring we have a competent workforce that can deliver patient care in an efficient and effective manner.","And finally, we are reorganizing our corporate performance improvement department by distributing these resources to our operating divisions. We believe this new structure, which combines corporate and field resources, will have many benefits. It will allow us to sustain our process improvement efforts more consistently. It will allow us to deploy best practices faster across the company. And it will increase our capacity for implementing company initiatives, such as our Clinical Excellence program, ER wait time reduction program, surgery room turnover and others. All of these initiatives leverage the unique scale of HCA. And we expect them to improve our services and improve our overall efficiency, which in turn should enhance our overall competitive positioning in our markets.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Sam, thank you very much. Janine, if you'd like to come on and take a queue for calls?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can walk us through your thought process with -- getting to the heart of some of the criticisms of HCA, the thought process behind your exchange contracting. I know you mentioned that you expect it to be a process to go on over time. But I think there's some confusion as to how you see your positioning vis-\u00e0-vis others and why perhaps HCA's unique market positioning and scale and scope might play a role in those decisions.","Victor L. Campbell","All right, Sheryl, thank you. Milton, Richard? Who wants to lead off of it?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. Let me lead off, and maybe others may want to add some thoughts. I think we've been very consistent describing all year our approach to exchange contracting. We have, in my view, taken a very consistent, disciplined approach, one where we have looked at the market dynamics, the particular sort of market makeup with the size of employers, the competition in the market and a structure exchange contracting accordingly to how we think the behavior of the uninsured may react in certain markets. Of course, currently with all the uncertainty around the exchanges early on, adds some additional confusion to it. But hopefully over time that, of course, will get worked out. But as I said, the result of our work has been that we have access to bronze plans in most of our hospitals, 97%. Almost 100 of our hospitals in the lowest or second-lowest bronze plan, so we feel good about that. We do think that in certain markets over time, where we may not be in the lowest-priced offering in a particular market, it'd be interesting to see how that evolves. In many of these markets, we have a large footprint. We have significant capacity with our emergency rooms. And it will be interesting to see how that plays out over time with respect to certain out-of-network activity in certain markets. So we feel good about where we are with our contracting strategy. I think it reflects the approach that we've been describing from the beginning that it would be disciplined. And again, we like where we are. But as I said in my comments, also believe that over the coming years, it will evolve, that network participations will change. We will probably make changes. And I'm sure the competitors will make changes. So this is not going to be a static situation in my view. And I think as it evolves, we'll be well positioned to compete for all the reasons that Richard described in his comments about our positioning with our core operational strategies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was curious if you could comment about the DOJ's ruling to HHS about purchasing premiums. I know that CMS just came out with a frequently asked question discouraging this. But any thoughts about that particular initiative and any other of the outreach initiatives associated with the Affordable Care Act?","Victor L. Campbell","Richard?","Richard M. Bracken","Let me just comment. Obviously, there are any number of outreach efforts that are out there that have been discussed. And really similar to some of the comments that Milton was making, we're evaluating and looking at them all to determine our course of actions. We believe that over time, best practices will surface. At this point, we have made no decisions to follow any particular course. You know that we were clear last time on our call about the kind of things we're doing in our hospitals in terms with our counselors. And we've provided some dollars to not-for-profit organizations. But really that's a pretty modest effort compared to what you read about. I think our course is going to be one of being careful, seeing what best practices are, what is clearly in the zone of compliance and charting our course appropriately. So I think that evolves over time -- this time just like our contracting strategies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is on Parallon. And you guys have made a number of acquisitions this year. I guess, I'd be curious just to get an update on what capabilities you think you've acquired and how you're approaching the market with your suite of services there. And maybe just some numbers at this point on what the revenue run rate looks like.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Darren, thank you. Milton, you want to take that one as well?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. A couple of transactions this year, Martin, Fletcher, a locum tenens organization. A larger transaction was The Outsource Group. We closed that July 1. So we've got 1 quarter under our belt with that transaction. Again, The Outsource Group is an organization that's based in St. Louis, about 4,000 employees. They provide revenue cycle management, extended business office outsourcing, Medicaid eligibility, which will be a new capability that we will have now in Parallon. Various other things, like on-site financial counseling and early-out self-pay collections, primary and secondary bad debt collections and the like. So it complements Parallon's core operations very well and brings a couple of new capabilities to us as well. Roughly, The Outsource Group should be probably around $125 million of revenue on an annual basis to size it for you. And we would expect margins in that business to ultimately be somewhere in the kind of the high-teens to possibly 20% range to size how we're thinking about that opportunity. Overall, Parallon, things are going well. Our operations with respect to our revenue cycle continues to go well. We are on track with our LifePoint implementation. I think they referenced that in their call. We have -- at their request, we've worked together with LifePoint to accelerate the implementation. It should be complete by the middle of next year with all of their hospitals. I think we'll have roughly about 35 hospitals implemented on a consolidated revenue cycle by the end of this year. So that's going well. Our CHP, Catholic Healthcare Partners transaction, we're starting up with them, early developments are going well. We will build a new center for them in Cincinnati. And so we are currently working through that process to get that site determined and up and running and start the migration. We have moved their revenue cycle employees over to Parallon. So that has occurred. So things are going on track. HealthTrust continues to do well. We're seeing solid growth in earnings from HealthTrust this year, year-to-date about 11%, roughly 10% to 11% in HealthTrust, so again going well. So overall, Parallon is performing well. I continue to think that over the coming years, we'll have many opportunities to grow through Parallon.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You guys did a great job controlling costs so far this year. But when we think about 2014, obviously there's going be a revenue opportunity from covering uninsured. I just am wondering whether there's something that you would point to as saying, \"Hey, we tightened our belt because things were tough this year. Next year, when maybe we get a little bit of a tailwind from collections, we might look to invest in XYZ.\" I wasn't sure if there's any thoughts about cost growth next year or things that maybe you dialed back on this year that need to be invested in next year.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Kevin, thank you. Sam, you want to take that one?","Samuel N. Hazen","Our operating teams have done a really good job reacting to the changes in volume trends that we saw starting back in the first quarter, as we mentioned on the past calls, and then what we've done in the third quarter here. I think when you think about what HCA is trying to do, it's more of a systemic effort at trying to gain efficiencies than it is an episodic effort at responding to certain dynamics here or there. And I mentioned a couple of the things that we're doing that will have efficiency opportunities embedded in them. And I think those will help us drive toward more efficiencies in our operations. And that's through eliminating redundancies in overhead, eliminating process inefficiencies and identifying new ways to leverage our supply chain. On our biggest cost trend, our labor, at this particular point, we're not seeing any unusual wage pressures in the marketplace as we think about our positioning today and look forward. And so our belief on our wage trends are that we can manage those consistent with where they've been and create the right kind of balance between that particular cost category and our revenue trends. So the company's efforts broadly on the cost front continue very aggressively and will, I think, create the kind of trends that we need to maintain in order to be effective. Like I said in my comments, our performance improvement reorganization is a huge opportunity for the company to create a better structure for sustaining and identifying new ways to generate efficiencies in our operations. The clinical data warehouse is a very unique asset that we think only resides inside of HCA at the level that it doesn't [ph] within our company. And that is going to be a very rich bit of data that allows us to improve our quality, find new ways to create process improvement and clinical efficiency, as well as cost efficiency. And so those things are big-ticket items for the company, and we feel good about how they present themselves over the next few years. And if we execute on those, as we've executed on other initiatives, I think we're going to be well positioned to keep our costs where we need them to be.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think I may have asked you about capital deployment. You just did a $500 million repurchase this last week, opportunistic. But it was a little smaller than some of the other repurchases you've done. Is that just a function of where you're at with your banks? And then also maybe comment on the hospital acquisition environment. So those 2 aspects of capital deployment.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Milton, you want to lead that?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Well, with respect to our share repurchase, $500 million share repurchase we just closed, the size was limited by our restricted payments basket, which at the time of the transaction was $878 million. And we expect at the end of this year, we should be somewhere around $550 million to $600 million of restricted payments basket capacity. And that, of course, would be net of the $500 million share repurchase. So that was somewhat of a limiting factor for us here in the -- at the end of the -- or the beginning, I should say, of the fourth quarter. With respect to acquisition opportunities, there's not a significant acquisition in terms of financial impact on our balance sheet that we see here in the short term. We have several transactions that we are looking at, more of what I would call the tuck-in acquisitions that we've completed, like we did down in Tampa with the IASIS facilities. As you know, we're looking at a transaction, it's public information down in Florida. We have a transaction that we're looking at in New Orleans. And of course, we're still -- the transactions of a couple of hospitals in Kansas City, still underway, going through the FTC process. So we continue to have those that are out there moving, and we'll continue to look for good opportunities through acquisition. We said, I think, for a few years here that we think the marketplace will present opportunities for us for acquisitions. We've got the capacity with our balance sheet to be out and to complete those transactions. So again, nothing that's material to our balance sheet that we're working on now but several smaller transactions that we'll be very pleased to complete somewhere in the coming several months.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question is around reform and the impact. You guys have spoken in the past about potentially sizing what you think that impact could be. So I'm curious as to sort of the timing of when you think you'll have your thoughts together on that. And maybe what are some of the key variables that you're still waiting to nail down?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. Well, I think we'll be looking at 2014 reform guidance when we give our annual 2014 guidance. And that will happen probably in February of '14. The variables are, I think, the biggest one is, especially here in the early part of reform, what will be the overall uptake in our markets through the exchanges. Will states ultimately expand Medicaid or not? And as you know, only 4 states that we operate in expanded Medicaid. So the big states to us, like Texas and Florida, did not expand. So how will that evolve over the coming couple of years would be very interesting for us and material, I think, to our model. So I think again those are the ones that we've talked about, just the overall uptake, our ability to gain market share in these markets where we do have contracts. And those would be, I think, the key variables for us. We have a good sense right now of what our pricing would be, of course, now that we've negotiated our rates. But still the overall volume uptake is going to be the big question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert H. Baird (sic) [Robert W. Baird].","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was just curious on the bronze plans that you've contracted with. What did the deductibles look like for those plans on average? And how are you thinking about collecting that? And is there any experience you have on any existing individual plans that you can refer to as kind of a collection rate?","R. Milton Johnson","Well, I think -- I'm looking at Juan. The maximum out-of-pocket on an individual bronze plan, Juan, do you remember that number?","Juan Vallarino","$6,240.","R. Milton Johnson","$6,240. And then if you're at the -- at 100% up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Guideline, now you can't do it with a bronze plan. But if you are in the silver, the second-lowest silver level plan, if you participate at that level, there's a cash assistance program from the federal government that will assist you with your out-of-pocket cost. So for example, at a 100% of the Federal Poverty Guideline, I think the actuarial value of that silver plan plus the cash assistance is about 94%. So it's a very high coverage. And again it moves up to -- it reduces up to 250% with a cash assistance plan. But the maximum out-of-pocket for an individual is just over $6,000.","Juan Vallarino","And it varies by income. So the less income you have, the higher -- the lower the out-of-pocket.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just following up on an earlier comment. Could you discuss your thoughts on retaining ER volumes, especially for those where you might not be in network? And how do you think about reimbursement for those volumes [ph]?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam or Milt, you want to address that?","R. Milton Johnson","Well, I think you're referring to -- in the markets on the exchange, where if a patient presents to our emergency room, they're in an emergent [ph] situation, of course, we will take care of that patient. And then we will bill the payor out-of-network charges. So typically, that would be full charges. Practically, it could be settled for something less. But there's a lot of variation in those various rates. But obviously, it would be something most likely at or higher than the commercial rate for those patients.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can give us a sense of what your current success rate is in terms of getting Medicaid eligibles signed up today and maybe how similar or not you think that would be in terms of getting exchange eligibles signed up next year.","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, you want that one?","Samuel N. Hazen","We have a very comprehensive effort across all of our hospitals to ensure that we have adequate resources in our facilities to assist with Medicaid eligibility applications and so forth. As Milton mentioned a minute ago, The Outsource Group will provide additional resources for the company to buttress those where it needs to, especially in those states where we've seen Medicaid expansion. I don't have the exact percentages here around how many applicants today get approved. But the vast majority of them tend to get approved for Medicaid. So it's north of 50%, probably around 60% or so of eligible Medicaid beneficiaries get approved. We work with those other patients to get other government funding or they follow through on the application process insufficiently and they wind up not getting approved. But we have a pretty high success rate. We monitor that by facility, we monitor that by state to understand where do we have opportunities to improve it. We think the presumptive eligibility procedures that are out there will assist us in that process somewhat. How much, we don't know yet, but it will have some impact on those metrics. But we have a pretty good program and the numbers are somewhere in that probably 2\/3 range approved. And 1\/3 that don't get approved for a host of reasons, some of which their income is too high, some of which their applications don't get turned in or we can't locate the patient, whatever the case may be. But again, we're evaluating those resources and looking very closely at those metrics on a routine basis to enhance the procedures where we can.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Whit's question. It brought up something interesting to me. Even if the actuarial value is 94%, how do you guys ultimately collect the deductible? Do you bill the Feds directly? Do you bill the plans? Are you responsible of getting it through the subsidized member?","Victor L. Campbell","Juan Vallarino is going to answer that one.","Juan Vallarino","You bill the plan.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, the subsidized [indiscernible] mentioned would come through the plan.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe to go back to the use of the Certified Application Counselors and given the difficulty with the exchanges so far, how have they behaved or how have they acted differently than you would expect them to work once the exchanges are up and running? And have you seen actually any improvement in being able to get people signed up on the exchanges?","Victor L. Campbell","All right, Milton, again.","R. Milton Johnson","Well, sure, we've been tracking the early activity with our application -- our Certified Application Counselors. We have approximately 400 of them. Quite frankly, they've encountered the difficulties that the public has encountered as trying to access the exchange via the Internet. So it's been off to a slow start. And that relative thought [ph] to the issues, then that's not unexpected. I think over time, we're going to see that improve as the system stabilizes. And as we gain greater access on a more consistent basis to the system, then we'll see that. We've trained our coordinators and we feel we're well positioned to perform. It's just a matter right now more of the technical difficulties that we're dealing with as far as getting people actually signed up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could provide some comments on what you're seeing in the company's initiatives regarding the rehab and behavioral health services business. And are you continuing to see market share gains in these segments?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Sam, you want to address rehab and behavioral?","Samuel N. Hazen","We have about 55 behavioral units inside of HCA today and we have a similar number of in-patient rehabilitation facilities inside the company. As I mentioned, we're up about 3.5% on behavioral admissions in the quarter. We're up about 8.5% on rehab admissions. Rehab is up 10% for the year and behavioral is up about 2.5% for the year. And that is slightly down. We still have opportunities to invest in these service lines within a number of our markets. And we are doing that. We're adding capacity in certain situations. We're adding physician capability in other situations that will allow us to grow our volumes. We still think there are opportunities for managing our continuum of care more effectively in certain situations that will enhance our ability to deliver more care in these 2 service lines. But when you look at the market share data in both of these service lines, we do have gains in share across the company. The behavioral service line, in particular, shows very strong demand curve. Rehab is not as strong but also stronger than other medical areas. And we think managing the continuum in total is a very important part of what we're trying to get done in the marketplace. It's really not just with those 2 service lines. We're doing it more broadly with pediatric service lines, with trauma service lines, with deeper capabilities in other service lines. We're using our infrastructure within our markets to manage the continuum more effectively. We have what we call transfer centers in each of our markets that allow us to assist the patient and the physician in navigating our continuum more effectively. That's allowed us to keep more patients in our system. And so we think those structural things will continue to evolve and allow us to gain share hopefully down the road.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question. Broadly looking ahead, right, I know reform is a black box for '14. But x that, I think you've talked about yourselves being a 5% grower on the EBITDA line, give or take. I just wanted to confirm as we look ahead to '14, is this a reasonable starting point to think about x reform? And I know you have about -- I think you have $100 million headwind from lower health care IT revenues. Any other headwinds or tailwinds you could point us to outside of that 5% growth would be helpful as well.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Milton?","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, sure. And I think, Justin, what we've been saying is a 3% to 5% EBITDA growth, to clarify. But seriously, and excluded -- I think, as you look at next year, I think what we've indicated is that, excluding the EHR incentive income, which is going to decline as we all know. We captured most of that upside in the early years of the opportunity. And also excluding the impact of the noncash share-based expense that we're incurring, again we're unique because of the LBO when we've had to restart our management equity plan, unique in our sector in that we have an increasing cost there. And after I think next year, that should then be up to its run rate. But excluding the impact of noncash share-based costs and excluding the headwind from the EHR incentive income, I think our base business can grow EBITDA in that 3% to 5% zone is something that we feel that is reasonable. And I think that's consistent with what we've been saying over the last several months.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","In your prepared remarks, you talked about seeing some pressure in the ER, specifically on lower-acuity stuff, while also mentioning expansion in the urgent care business. So if you don't mind just sharing your strategy and your views in that area. I mean, should we think about CareSpot as a market share capture strategy? Or is that a proactive push to get -- to move some of the lower-acuity or lowest-acuity volumes now to the ER going forward?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Brian, thank you and Sam, you want close it?","Samuel N. Hazen","Yes. I think one of fundamental aspects of our growth agenda is to ensure that we have adequate access to our system. And that includes a host of different capabilities, everything from emergency room capacity, as Richard mentioned, to physician clinics to other outpatient settings in locations that make it convenient and easy for patients to access an HCA system. We are exploring the concept of urgent care in a very substantial way to understand how it can fit into our overall network of offerings. CareSpot is in 2 markets, largely at this particular point in Nashville and Kansas City. We are studying the effects of that. It is intended to be more around creating access than it is to move patients necessarily from one setting or the other, although it does play a part in that approach. But we believe it's a convenient and efficient way for patients to get low-end care and then provide access to an HCA network if they need more substantial care or sophisticated care down the road. And so that will continue to evolve. We've studied that. We actually have another market, pediatric urgent care centers that are connected to our children's hospitals that serve a similar role. Additionally, we have many affiliations with urgent care centers in these major metropolitan markets that allow us to virtually expand our network. And HCA is the downstream health care system for some of the freestanding urgent care centers that exist in the market. So it's all again part of the core strategy of trying to create physician access to the system. And we will continue to study the effect of owning urgent care as opposed to affiliating and what that means to us as we move forward.","Victor L. Campbell","All right. With that, thank you. Brian, thank you for your question. I thank everyone for participating. And Mark and I will be around all day and look forward to seeing you soon.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor Campbell","All right. Cassandra, thank you very much and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call including those of you listening to our webcast. With me here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., including losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in our third quarter earnings release which I hope all of you have seen this morning. The call is being recorded, a replay will be available later today.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","All right. Thank you, Vic and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast today. I hope everyone has had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning. Following my remarks, I will turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the results of the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $1.815 billion compared to $1.828 billion in last year's third quarter. Adjusting both periods for EHR incentive income, share-based compensation and RAC Medicaid waiver adjustments, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 3.5% over the prior year. The results of the third quarter fell short of our internal expectations primarily due to higher than expected labor cost and to a lesser extent and unfavorable payer mix shift and increased drug cost.","As we analyze the quarter, we were extremely pleased with our revenue growth in the quarter. Reported revenue grew 6.9% over the last year's third quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by our volume growth as we reported strong same facility growth in admissions, adjusted admissions, emergency room visits and surgery cases in the face of tough comps for last year.","Volume growth was broad-based across our markets and service lines. Our volume growth agenda is comprehensive and consistently delivers solid results. This speaks to the positive characteristics of our urban markets and the execution of our strategies to invest capital on additional inpatient and outpatient capacities and to the development of clinical capability across our service lines.","Based on expected growth in demand in our markets and continued expansion of our market share, I believe we will continue to see opportunities for volume growth. On the cost side, we reported higher labor expense than we have seen in recent trends. Labor productivity and contract labor presents opportunities for improvement and certain management actions have been implemented while others will continue to be implemented to address productivity and contract labor expense. Bill and Sam can provide additional details on our labor cost and our actions to address in the Q&A.","Now moving to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $1.101 billion and our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.84 times. This morning we announced that the board has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to 3 billion of the company's outstanding shares which would be in addition to the 1 billion authorization that we announced in May which currently has approximately 235 million remaining. The company has indicated in the past that its first priority for use of cash would be to pursue organic growth and reinvest in existing markets. Second, we look for M&A opportunities and then third, we consider based on market conditions, either debt repayment or share repurchases.","Today's announced share repurchase authorization is consistent with its capital deployment strategy. During the quarter the company repurchased 5.1 million shares of its stock at a cost of $446 million. Year-to-date, through October 23, 2015, we have repurchased 22.6 million shares at a cost of $1.765 billion. In fact, since October 28, 2014, the company has repurchased approximately 36.7 million of its shares at a total cost of $2.765 billion.","And then finally I would like to congratulate Dr. Jonathan Perlin on his election to membership into the National Academy of Medicine. His election is recognition of his many contributions to healthcare and his commitment to improving patient care. Now I will turn the call over to Bill.","William Rutherford","Thank you, Milton and good morning everybody. I would like to move right in to some of the areas affecting the company's performance for the quarter then I will run through some of our operating statistics and finish with an update on health reform.","When adjusted for the RAC settlement and Texas waiver accrual adjustment we recorded in the third quarter of last year, as well as share-based compensation and high-tech, on a year-over-year basis the company recorded a 7.2% revenue growth and a 3.5% adjusted EBITDA growth in Q3 of 2015 when compared to Q3 of 2014. Also when adjusted for these items our adjusted EBITDA margin declined [7] [ph] basis points for the quarter as compared to last year.","There are three primary areas I would like to discuss that affected the company's performance. First, we carried more labor cost in the quarter compared to our plan. There are primarily two items that impacted our labor cost. We saw an increase in the use of contract labor during the quarter. Our contract labor expense was up $55 million or 36% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. We have seen growth throughout the year but it did accelerate during this quarter. This increased use of contract labor is used to fill in for staff vacancies that occur because of higher turnover rates and needs we have to serve the increased volume.","Because of the premium we have to pay for these contract labor resources, we estimate this issue had about a $25 million impact on the company's year-over-year performance. The other labor observation I will call out is some productivity declines we experienced in the quarter. In essence we didn\u2019t achieve the operating leverage we had anticipated from the volume growth. We did see this developing in the quarter and our management teams have already begun necessary adjustments. We estimate this issue had about $25 million impact on the company's performance for the quarter.","The second area that impacted our results in the quarter is the continued increases in pharmaceutical costs. Our pharmacy cost in the third quarter of 2015 were up in total just under 13%. When we adjust for borrowing growth, we estimate the company had about $15 million higher pharmacy cost due to price increases for certain classes drugs. We have seen multiple price increases for a small number of drugs which primarily relate to single manufactured pharmaceuticals. We have various strategies we are deploying to attempt to offset these cost.","And the third area is we saw an increase in our uninsured borrowings in the quarter. Recall, we saw this developing in the second quarter. In Q3 of this year, our uninsured admissions were up 13.6% as compared to Q3 of 2014 and uninsured adjusted admissions were up 8.8% over the prior year. For perspective, this uninsured admission growth equates to roughly 4,400 admissions. These results were generally broad-based across our markets. Given our presence in Florida and Texas, the uninsured growth in these two states accounted for just under 75% of the uninsured growth for the company.","We believe there are a couple of drivers of this uninsured growth. One is, we saw a slowing of Medicaid conversions in the quarter. That is uninsured patients that become qualified for Medicaid. We believe state processing issues in both Texas and Kansas impacted a number of Medicaid applications that were reviewed during this quarter. And we believe this accounts for approximately 25% of the uninsured increase.","We also saw an increase in the number of people previously registered as insured that were converted to self-pay in the quarter. For instance, we saw 480 patients who were previously registered as health exchange convert over to self-pay in the quarter. We believe this is likely due to non-payment of premiums. Adjusted for these two items, we saw an underlying growth of uninsured patients who presented during the quarter of about 6.5%. And most of this growth we attributed to our 6.2% growth in uninsured emergency room business.","The impact to the company of this uninsured volume increase is the incremental variable cost we have to serve these patients. We estimate we carried approximately $20 million of incremental cost to the serving of this uninsured volume growth as compared to the prior years. So we believe these three areas are the primary driver of the company's performance relative to our plan for the quarter. Our teams across the company are actively addressing these and other areas to counter some of these trends.","As Milton indicated, we were pleased by our topline performance and I will next move into a summary of some of our volume statistics. As we reported, the third quarter -- in the third quarter our same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% against some fairly difficult comps from last year. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of this volume in a moment but I will give you some results by payer class.","During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.4% and 3.1% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 8.9% on a same facility basis and represents 33% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.9% respectively in the quarter. Managed care and other which includes exchange admissions increased 1.4% and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% on a same facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room business increased 5.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year.","Same facility case mix or intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter 0.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter. The same facility in-patient surgeries increasing 1.6% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.2% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.9%. Adjusted for last year's RAC and waiver adjustments, same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2%. Same facility managed care and other including exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 5% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $525 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $914 million in the quarter, a decline of $117 million from the prior year period. Our same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.755 billion or an increase of $642 million over the prior year period.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.101 billion. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $3.176 billion or a 12.6% increase from prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.586 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. And debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at September 30 of '15 compared to 3.96 times, December 31, 2014.","And lastly, let me touch on health reforms. In the third quarter, we saw 11,445 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,720 we saw in the third quarter of last year or a 48% year-over-year growth of exchange activity. Our Q3 volume is in line with our expectations and comparable to the 11,560 exchange admissions we served in the second quarter of 2015. We saw 40,200 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to just over 27,000 in the third quarter of 2014 and 44,740 in the second quarter of 2015.","Based on our look back of previous coverage, we still estimate about 40% of these admissions were uninsured prior to health reform. When we roll all the components of health reform that we could track, we currently estimate health reform contributed to just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. So that concludes my remarks and I will turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel Hazen","Good morning. I am going to concentrate my comments on a little bit more detail around our volume for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was solid in the third quarter. We believe this performance continues to reflect growing demand for healthcare services in HCA markets and further gains in market share for the company. We believe the gains in market share have been driven by combination of solid execution of our growth agenda and increased capital spending that has been invested to improve access to our networks and to add operational capacity.","Our growth in volume was broad-based across most of the companies markets and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a same facility, year-over-year basis for the quarter, all but one of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions and growth in adjusted admission. All domestic divisions had growth in emergency room visits, seven divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admission and nine divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for these payer classes.","Managed care and exchange ER business grew by 3.5%. 12 divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. Nine divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 27.3% of total admissions for the quarter, consistent with the third quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the tenth straight quarter with growth in inpatient surgeries. Ten divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries which were up 0.8% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in nine out of the last ten quarters.","Surgeries grew by 1.8% in our ambulatory surgery division. Surgical growth was strong in orthopedics, neurosciences and cardiovascular service lines. Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 0.9%, managed care and exchange deliveries were up 5.7%. Neonatal admissions grew 1%. Behavioral health admissions were up 7.4%. Rehab admissions were up 9% and our average length of stay grew by 1.6%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions.","Market share trends for the company's inpatient business for the 12-month period ended March 2015, were slightly improved over past trends. Our market share grew by 31 basis points. As a result, the company's composite market share is at 24.6%. Approximately 79% of our market increased share and gains were achieved across most service line categories. Overall, inpatient demand across HCA markets continued to show sequential strength during this period. Demand growth accelerated in our markets in each of the last three quarters of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 with the first quarter showing growth of 3.9%.","Commercial demand in HCA markets was stronger for this period with an increase of almost 5%. We believe inpatient demand in both the second and third quarters of 2015 were also strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available. So with that, let me turn the call back to Vic for questions.","Victor Campbell","All right. Thank you very much. Cassandra, if you could come back on and let's take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua Raskin","Appreciate all of the color on the uncompensated care. But I guess first question on, or my only question, will be on physician compensation. And I'm just curious, are you seeing any increases in cost to recruit or retain physicians? And maybe if you could speak specifically around the ED that will be helpful as well.","Victor Campbell","Sam will take that.","Samuel Hazen","Okay. Yes, let me answer this. And let me frame our physician discussion a bit. We have about 37,000 active participants on our medical staff, physicians. Of that, about 10% are employed by HCA. Our employment numbers on a year-over-year basis are up about 15%. About 40% of that is related to the acquisition of the urgent care company in Dallas, Fort Worth. So we are up roughly 7% to 8% on employees positions. That trend is generally consistent with the previous two years and so we continue to add to our medical staff both from the standpoint of employed positions as well as affiliated positions. Our medical staff in total has grown about 2.5% so far this year which is a really good number for the company.","And so we are not seeing anything unusual with respect to physician compensation elements inside of our business. With respect to the emergency room specifically, we do have a number of companies that we work with across the country. We have various relationships with them. But for the most part, that component of our business is managing at a normal trend and we are not seeing any kind of unique changes to our relationships with those organizations. Nor are we seeing it in anesthesia or radiology or any of the other hospital based areas. So that issue is really not presenting a significant challenge to HCA.","Operator","And we will go next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","I just wanted to dig into the cost issues a little bit. As far as the labor costs go, it's a little bit unusual for me to think about needing temporary labor and losing productivity. So if you can just give a little bit of color about what exactly happened there. And then how much of this you think that you have addressed for Q4 and how much of this do you think you've addressed for 2016? I guess, specifically labor costs but if there are any savings on the pharmacy or anything you can do on mix, that will be helpful as well.","Victor Campbell","All right. Kevin, thank you. Sam?","Samuel Hazen","Okay. Let me try to give as much color as I can on our labor spend and I want to start with contract labor. And I think there are a couple of macro issues that we are sorting through that are really difficult to specifically ascribe anything to but I think they are reasonable assumptions. I mean we do have an improving economy as we have indicated across most of HCA's markets and we think that is having some effect on our overall labor equation. It's pocketed in some markets and more significant in others, but nonetheless it is having some effects we believe and we have been indicating that as a potential issue. Is it material at this particular point in time, I don\u2019t think it is. I think it's a manageable event.","The other issue is, within certain service lines we have seen significant competition in new supply. And that\u2019s especially relevant in the emergency room where we have seen difficulties in recruiting emergency room nurses and having to use contract labor to service our emergency rooms. But the specific issues for HCA related to contract labor are really three-fold. One, we have seen an increase in turnover, nursing turnover in the company. It was running last year about 17.5%. It's trended up to about 19%. So that\u2019s created some challenge for us and we have had to use some contract labor to deal with that.","The second thing is, we have sustained very strong volume across the company throughout the year and that\u2019s requiring some additional staffing in order to service that volume. And then we have had a few recruitment challenges and some minor transition issues we think are temporary with respect to the rollout of our One HR model. And so that\u2019s contributed to the growth in contract labor within our nursing ranks. Last year about 6.5% of our nursing spend was in contract labor. This year it's about 8.7%. So we have seen fairly sizable increase and that has been accelerating a little bit throughout the year as Bill indicated and some of this started last year.","So what we are trying to do on the contract labor side specifically, is really focus on improving our turnover metrics. And we think we have a reasonable plan for being able to do that and some early indications of some positive indicator. The first thing is really related to better onboarding and support for new grads. We hire a lot of new graduate nurses and they have a tendency to turnover a higher pace if they are not supported properly. So we have got two or three different programs that we are utilizing to deal with the turnovers that we are seeing with the new graduate nurses. There is nurse residency programs that we are using and we are also leveraging our own internal registry company, Workforce Solutions, to sponsor certain programs and create a better environment for our new grads.","The second thing that we are doing is streamlining our recruiting process a bit to get the right nurses on the floor at the right time. And I think we have made some adjustment as we have moved through our One HR rollout to improve that and that\u2019s going to yield some benefit. And then finally, we have increased our training of our managers. We have got some better metrics and even greater accountability around turnover. And where we need to, we have adjusted wages and we will continue to do that in isolated cases.","The good news here is this, and this is part of the productivity challenge that we experienced. We actually have 750 additional nurses in the HCA pipeline right now that are related to graduate nursing programs and they are going through orientation. That is a very significant increase over last year when we had about 2,400 at this time. So we are up to almost 3,100 from 2,400. And we think that\u2019s going to create some opportunities to reduce or at least moderate the growth in contract labor. But those graduate nurses create a part of the productivity problem that we had in the quarter. Our productivity was probably off about 0.7% as you look at FTEs per adjusted occupied bed. That represented about 1,500 FTEs, if you will. So about half of those were attributable we believe to the onboarding and the orientation of graduate nurses.","The other area that has contributed to some of our productivity challenge has been the acceleration of initiatives in the company to advance our growth position and our competitive positioning within the marketplace. We have numerous field base initiatives that are centered on positioning the company for growth and we think those make a sense over the long run, but unfortunately they have ramp up, startup cost and so forth that create a little bit of a productivity drag on our overall metric.","We have a few other corporate initiatives that you have heard about. Whether they are in clinical IT or in One HR, that are creating a little bit of a challenge for us in the short run and we think those will phase out over time. And then finally some of our startup hospitals and new acquisitions have created a little bit of a dislocation with respect to HCA productivity versus the new hospital productivity. Having said all that, we have refocused and redoubled our efforts to make sure that our systems are working properly, that our scheduling mechanisms are precise and we saw some indications of improvement mid-quarter in September using that as a point of reference. We have significantly improved over August and July as it related to typical productivity measures reflecting some of these graduate nurses coming off orientation and at the same time making sure we didn\u2019t have any mistakes, if you will, in our overall management.","So we are confident that the company is doing the right thing with respect to the adjustments that we need to make. We are also doing the right thing with respect to hiring nurses and making sure that we can replace them, contract labor with permanent nurses. And we also believe we are doing the right thing by executing on these different initiatives that are preparing the company for success down the road as opposed to ignoring those or putting those particular initiatives off. So I think that\u2019s a long-winded answer. I know that\u2019s on a lots of peoples mind but I want everybody to understand how we are thinking about it and what we are doing to manage it as an organization.","Victor Campbell","Sam, thanks. Kevin, thank you. Just let me add that, as you can clearly hear from Sam's description, we clearly understand the issues in the quarter with respect to labor cost. I can tell you the organization is highly focused on making as many corrective actions as possible, as quickly as possible. Productivity, we can react to that more timely. Contract labor, more of a mid-term, intermediate term and we expect to make short term improvements. But to get back to where we were may take more of an intermediate term but we are definitely understanding issues and I think we are doing everything reasonably possible to address them.","Operator","And we will go next to Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. Maybe a high-level question if I could, and I'm not expecting that you have all the answers here. But if you look at the exchange attrition that you saw in the quarter. Number one, I'd sort of be interested in how you think that compares to a year ago? And number two, at a higher level, is there something that's brewing here that may be wrong with the perception of the value of health coverage albeit even very subsidized, that people who had coverage before aren't paying the premiums but are showing up in the emergency room for care that presumably most of that is going to be written off given limited ability to pay. Just curious, your thoughts on that as you look ahead to next year and what to expect from the exchange enrollment?","Victor Campbell","Thanks, Matt and I think Bill wants to...","Samuel Hazen","Yes. Let me address piece of it and Bill may add some more detail and color on this. But keep in mind that the benefit of health reform is still materially in line with our expectation for the year. And we still see the upside of reform and we saw growth in the exchanges in the third quarter of this year over the third quarter of last year. So we are still seeing solid growth. Now the issue of seeing some reduction in terms of lives in the exchanges, is realty as well. I don\u2019t have data through the third quarter, I have CMS data through June where I can compare the number of lives in the exchange as of end of March as compared to end of June at 2015. And there is a decrease at the end of June. Nationally it's about 2.3% fewer lives in the exchange and for HCA states it's about 3%.","So we are seeing -- and most of that is because of Florida. Florida has among the highest disenrollment numbers as far as percentage. Although still a very high number enrolled in exchanges in Florida. So that\u2019s probably a piece. It's hard for us to quantify because I don\u2019t have this information by market, I have got it by state. But we do see some reduction in covered lives and again that\u2019s through the end of June. With all that being said, reform is still playing out as we expected in terms of impact of HCA's earnings. And Bill, if you need to add?","William Rutherford","Yes. I will just try to add. We did go back and look at last year to see whether that changed. We think the growth of that 480 admissions has grown about 320. So roughly 130 or so in the prior year. So it moved up. If you look at that as a percentage of our total exchange activity it\u2019s roughly 3.5% which may fall in line with some of those macro studies that we see.","Operator","And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick of Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl Skolnick","Thank you very much and appreciate all that, especially the passion with which Sam describes what he is doing to fix the labor cost issue. One of the things you also attributed to, and good job on that, thank you, one of the things that you also attributed the weakness in the quarter on the EBITDA line to, but I'm not getting that sense here, is to payer-mix. And in particular either a slowdown or clearly not a decline but some sort of slowdown in managed care. And I'm wondering if we can explore that a little bit, especially given the statistics you gave with a 48% increase in exchange related managed care lives year-over-year and very strong components of revenue from managed care and clearly you're still able to get pricing there. But can we explore that issue? And if it's not as big a factor as you perhaps thought it was on the preview, give us some comfort as to why this external issue isn't likely to be a factor going forward? Because everything else you can control, that's something, to some extent you can control and to some extent you might not be. So tell us what's going on with managed care please.","Victor Campbell","All right, Sheryl. Thank you. Good question and Sam you want to lead on this one?","Samuel Hazen","Yes. Let me say this from the historic. I don\u2019t think in any of our markets there is any structural changes that have occurred with our relationships with commercial payers that would suggest we are in any significant way begin steered away from or out of contract or any of that. That is not the case. The company is locked in on the number and the available contract today just as we were last year and as we look forward to 2016 and 2017, we are roughly 75% contracted on '16 and 50% contracted on '17 at very consistent terms with recent past year. So for the quarter we were up what, 1.8% on adjusted admissions. That is slightly down from where we were in the first part of the year. I think the first part of the year Sheryl, benefitted from the first quarter in particular where our exchange comp against last year was quite a bit positive.","And so our trend of about 2% in this quarter is not that far off where we expect it to be. We actually grew our revenue at almost 6% in the third quarter compared to 7.7% year-to-date. So it is off a bit when I look at that, but there is nothing to suggest that the economy across HCA's 42 markets has dramatically changed or any other competitive dynamic has had an impact on our business. There is a normal ebb and flow to our business and sometimes it's hard to discern exactly why it trends down a bit. But I was reasonably encouraged by the fact that we still saw volume growth in our commercial book of business in the third quarter of 2%. That was a positive indicator for me. And it suggests that there is still growing demand in that particular segment of the business and it's very important as you know.","So I can't put anything on it at this particular point in time. Obviously, if we get the second quarter market share data and we start to see early reads on third quarter market share data, it will give me some better insights into whether or not we had a market share loss potentially in the third quarter which I don\u2019t believe is the case. So right now there is not a lot to point to. I will reemphasize that in my comments, I mean our managed care delivery volume was up 5.7%, that\u2019s a very strong number. Our emergency room visits were up 3.5% and within some other outpatient areas we had solid growth on the commercial side as well.","So that\u2019s sort of my take at this particular point. As I get more external data sources, I will be able to check my thinking on those particular assumption.","William Rutherford","And Sam, too, I think we had a really tough comp to last year. We had a favorable comp in the first quarter but the third quarter of last year I think was a, created a more difficult comp with respect to the growth rate over prior year.","Operator","And we will go next to A.J. Rice of UBS.","A.J. Rice","I want to come back to some of Bill's comments about the uninsured pickup you saw. I think there was a reference to, there was a slowdown in Medicaid process in Kansas and Texas. Is that something where you have got a bolus of patients that therefore you are going to maybe get incremental reimbursement in the fourth quarter? And I am going to broaden it out a little bit on the uninsured. I've been asked about repeatedly, about your ER investments and whether that's potentially some of the early volume you see there in the freestanding or associated with your facilities. Is that in any way driving incremental uninsured? And then also any comment on the Texas oil price drop and whether that might be having an impact?","Samuel Hazen","Well, Bill's going to answer it, but I want to add one more comment to what I said a moment ago about commercial volume. I was just looking over the last 11 quarters. In the third quarter we had the most adjusted admissions for our commercial book of business then we have ever had over that same time period. So, yes, it was a challenge then when we were up but the number we had in the third quarter was the highest number we had ever had. So, sorry, Bill?","William Rutherford","Yes. A.J., let me try to address the other questions that you have. One, specifically on what we cited as what we think is a slowdown in processing some Medicaid application in Texas and Kansas. We are hopeful those are temporary and as the state kind of goes through processing those then we will begin to see those covered on Medicaid. But that\u2019s really reflecting itself in a low conversion rate in both Texas and Kansas. And again, we attribute maybe a quarter of our 4000 or so uninsured growth relative to that issue. So we are hopeful that does correct itself going forward.","On kind of broader uninsured trends in the ED, we are seeing a growth in ED volume and that has a corresponding growth of uninsured ED but you had as Sam mentioned a lot of other kind of commercial and uninsured ED growth to kind of offset that.","Samuel Hazen","And I think the payer mix, Bill, in the emergency room was about the same as this.","William Rutherford","Pretty [possible] [ph]. When you look at uninsured as a percent, it still gets to around that 20% level. So it hasn\u2019t materially changed on us. And then Texas oil. Texas oil, I have not seen anything. When we look at Houston uninsureds, it's no more pronounced than any other markets that we have across the company.","Samuel Hazen","Clearly the oil economy have had some impact on Houston in particular and then some sprinkled impact across other Texas markets. However, the Texas economy is so strong that there still reported job growth even in Houston and obviously in the other markets and we are seeing that in the demand that we are studying within the Texas markets.","William Rutherford","And then one last one, A.J., I think you asked, the freestanding ED strategy we have really does not impact in any of our uninsured trends.","Operator","And we will go next to John Ransom of Raymond James.","John Ransom","Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for 4Q and what you see relative to business mix and staffing that may be different than 3Q? Thanks.","Samuel Hazen","All right, I don\u2019t know how much we can really address 4Q.","William Rutherford","Well, I think our guidance states it pretty clearly as far as the expectation goes. As far as the...","John Ransom","In other words, your guidance didn't really change that much from 4Q, so obviously you are seeing some of these issues as temporary. So just a little more color would be great. Thanks.","William Rutherford","Well, I think at a high level, John, we clearly as you just heard, I think Sam described we are expecting to see improvement in the productivity. Again we have already, we have implemented actions. We will continue to implement other actions during the quarter that we hope will show results here in the fourth quarter. So I mentioned in my earlier comments, some around the implementations of actions around contract labor. Maybe more the intermediate term, certainly hope to have some impact in the fourth quarter. But that\u2019s solving a turnover issue is a little bit longer term issue. You know basically we see continued top line growth that gives us lot of encouragement about the fourth quarter. And then we think -- we have taken actions around some of the initiatives that Sam mentioned. So I think the outlook for the fourth quarter is reasonable and I am comfortable with our guidance.","John Ransom","And just on that point -- sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. So on that point, is there any reason to think 4Q, 2015 will be any more seasonal than 4Q '14? Are you seeing elective procedures getting pushed further and further back?","Samuel Hazen","No, I don\u2019t think so. As we know Q4 is generally one of our strongest quarters that I don\u2019t see '15 being any seasonally different then maybe what we have experienced in the recent past.","Operator","And we will go next to Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","I will change gears, here. Maybe on the DC front, obviously a lot of talk about how to deal with this, addressing the Part B premium increases for Medicare beneficiaries, talk of cuts for provider or for the program. Could you talk and provide us your view on how you see that playing out and how you see hospitals exposed on that issue? Thanks.","Victor Campbell","Sorry, Frank. I will go ahead and do this. I guess number one, I think everybody has probably seen or heard there was a bill proposed, put together last night. It's our understanding that the house will likely vote on it this week and send it next week. I really haven't read all the 144 pages, I haven't read hardly any of it. But I have seen few synopsis here and there. I guess on the front side, number one, it is still proposed so we will see where it comes out at the end. First, we don\u2019t like any reductions in Medicare payments ever. But having said that, we also know that on more than one occasion we have to help for the better good of whatever.","The one reduction which is in there which we have seen before is the extension of the sequester now going out to 2025. And then I think the only other Medicare reimbursement related reduction or going forward relates to some outpatient, off campus changes. And I guess what I can say there, number one, they are prospective as to future transactions. So that\u2019s what's a good thing. It's not anything retroactive and it's not a straight cut. So we will study that closely. But I never want to say it cuts good but I have seen worse cuts.","Frank Morgan","But this is essentially backend loaded so it wouldn\u2019t affect 2016.","Victor Campbell","I think that\u2019s fair.","Operator","And we will go next to Whit Mayo of Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo","Can you just remind me where we are today on Texas UPL and the indigent care program? I know it was $142 million headwind versus last year. I feel like there was another $70 million number that I had in my notes. And then maybe just remind us where you are on the $100 million of investments that you talked about earlier this year?","Victor Campbell","All right. You are sneaking in two questions. But we will let you have that. So somebody is going to address Texas UPL and then we will talk about the investments. Bill, you want the UPL piece?","William Rutherford","Yes. Well, on Texas waiver program, we really haven't seen any material changes in that program. In the quarter we recorded about $87 million of waiver revenue which is really consistent and almost exact same that we recorded in Q2. So that\u2019s remained consistent for us. The $142 million you mentioned was an adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of last year and we have kind of adjusted for that. We did anticipate earlier in the year a potential reduction in the waiver revenue but we set, I believe in last quarter we no longer anticipated that. So our waiver revenue accrual we are recording this, is really consistent throughout 2015.","Samuel Hazen","Yes. On the corporate initiative and so forth -- this is Sam -- the third quarter was a high watermark for the implementation of a couple of our initiatives. On the HR side as I said, we are deeper, almost halfway through our rollout. Maybe even two-thirds the way through our rollout on our One HR and we did have a significant cost variance compared to the third quarter last year and our overall HR cost center. And then on the clinical IT side, again, the third quarter was a fairly large quarter with respect to a number of company initiatives to improve our clinical IT capabilities and put ourselves in a better position with our physicians and enhance our nurses ability to deliver care and then just to improve our clinical data warehouse. So those are all components of the third quarter. It presented some comparison and challenges. We are pretty much at a high watermark on our HR spend and that will level out. IT continues to be an opportunity for the company and we will have some incremental growth there and we are going through our planning process for 2016. As we speak to make sure our priorities are lined up with where they need to be for the next few years.","Operator","And we will go next to Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker","So just on rehab and behavioral growth, both had extremely strong growth in the quarter here. Maybe if you could just discuss your investments in these areas and maybe the room for continued growth for both of them. Thank you.","Victor Campbell","Sam, line is yours.","Samuel Hazen","Both of these components of our business continue to perform very well for us. And keep in mind they only represent about 7.5% of our total admissions. Behavioral representing about 6% and rehab representing about 1.5%. We have ongoing development of new units in expansion of existing units in motion as we speak. In some instances that\u2019s to actually add service line capability in certain markets and then in others it's to add capacity in order to deal with our occupancy levels and the constraints that we have got for growth with respect to that. They both are very central to service lines for HCA. The behavioral health service line is very central to being able to manage our emergency room service line very effectively. And then rehab is very central to our neurosciences and trauma program. So they are very complementary on that front. And we will continue to leverage components of those strategy in a collaborative way, if you will, to advance our position.","The capital investment on these is small in the overall scheme of HCA's $2.7 billion of spend that we intend to pay for next year. So it's not a very significant component of that total spend but it is significant with respect to those particular service lines.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Just a question on exchanges. So as we think about going into the open enrollment season, are there any initiatives that you guys can put in place or are already putting in place to drive exchange enrollment? We saw the rates come out yesterday. Is there anything related to that that you can do to put the message across to currently uninsured folks? Thank you","William Rutherford","Yes. Thank you, Brian. This is Bill. Last year we stepped up our efforts in our communities. We partnered with several agencies including Enroll America and others, to try to reach out inside our communities where we believe still uninsured people have the opportunity to participate. We are going to continue to do that in our enrollment period. We have a team and a committee of people that are working with our local markets and some third party agencies where we will be sponsoring community agencies, participating with other community events and trying to reach out to the uninsured volume in our communities that we think still are able for subsidies. We are trying to target that very thoughtfully in some of our key and larger markets where we have data that suggests there is still opportunity there.","So I would characterize that we are active in that space and we are working diligently to try to reach out to that community.","Victor Campbell","And Brian, I would add, I think most of you saw HHS, they have put projections which are pretty conservative I think, going into next year. But the good news is, they also cited that they were going to put increased efforts in five different markets. The good news is three of those five happen to be important market to us. One is Houston, one is Dallas and one is Miami. We don\u2019t care much about their New Jersey effort or wherever their other one was, but those are three good ones for us. So thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Is the higher bad debt simply a reflection of the uninsured or is there anything else going on in terms of how you are treating discounts versus charity or collections on the insured piece? And then just real quick, as somewhat of a follow-up. The pricing stat on the inpatient side is sort of flattish. Could you just help reconcile that versus the revenue per adjusted admission. Thanks.","Victor Campbell","All right. So, Bill, do you want to...?","William Rutherford","Let me try kind of your bad debts and Ralph thanks for the question. As you know we have historically looked at the total uncompensated care which includes bad debts and uninsured and charity. And from period to period you can't get some movement from one or the other. With our slowdown and pending Medicaid conversions we saw this quarter, that does put a little bit more in the allowance through doubtful accounts which flows through for bad debts. But our total uncompensated care generally is moving in concert with what our uninsured trends are. We have seen recent growth or continued growth of co-pays and deductibles. That\u2019s not recent. Our collection rates are staying really consistent with where they have been in the prior years. So we are not really seeing any erosion in collection. So even though the co-pays and deductibles have grown, our collection rates amounts have remained stable. And so the largest factor on our uncompensated care continues to remain the uninsured growth. On the inpatients data, we need to get back with you on that -- we need to flow through on that.","Victor Campbell","Yes. We will follow up on that one, Ralph. I am not sure anybody has that answer.","Operator","And we will go next to Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","One question, three parts if you will indulge me. First, did I miss the charity and discount disclosure? I was listening but maybe I didn't write it down?","William Rutherford","You missed it. I will be happy to give it to you again, Gary. Let me pull it up. So our same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $525 million. Charity care totaled 914 which was a decline of 117 from the prior year. Uninsured discounts totaled 2.755 which was an increase of 642.","Victor Campbell","Right. You simply didn\u2019t listen. I am not sure we will let you do the other two pieces.","Gary Taylor","Oh, I get dinged. It's all related. Real quickly. I know at one point, you were writing -- or early in '14 you were writing off 100% of the inpatient self-pay via charity and discount and none of that was really flowing through to the net revenue before bad debt. Is that still true? Or it sounds like maybe, from your answer to the last question, maybe some of that is changing with the Medicaid pending?","William Rutherford","Yes. Let me just try to clarify. So we have a charity care policy that if you meet our charity guidelines, we do write off 100% of your bill. If you don\u2019t meet our charity guidelines and you are uninsured, we apply an uninsured discount which is basically reflective of what you would be billed if you are insured. So it's not 100% but it's a substantial portion of your bill is written off on uninsured discount and then the residual then goes through kind of the bad debt line item. But you also have movements going on with Medicaid and pending Medicaid that affects those items as well.","Gary Taylor","Okay. That's very typical treatment. So I must have misunderstood. My last question is, can you just give us an update on co-pay and deductible as a percentage of revenue? And could you be clear as to whether that's before or after contractual discounts or any other discounts or bad debt? Kind of how do you size what co-pay deductibles look like?","Samuel Hazen","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen over the past recent years a growth in the patient liability related to co-pays and deductibles. And we still see that. I call that a net 10% to 12% on a per account basis. But our collections have remained relatively stable. We have said and we validated this recently about a 30% of our write-offs were attributable to kind of deductible and cos and the balance to uninsured. That really has not changed and the data that we have seen. So I would tell you that the deductible and co-pay environments have been relatively stable for us, relative on a material way to our trends.","William Rutherford","And some of that we are still collecting upfront.","Samuel Hazen","And we still collected at least a third of that upfront.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Wright of Sterne Agee.","Brian Wright","Was there any impact at all of fewer weekdays post-Labor Day this quarter?","Victor Campbell","Anybody want that?","William Rutherford","Not that we [indiscernible].","Victor Campbell","I think we got three no's.","Brian Wright","Fair enough. And then just one clarification. The ACA EBITDA impact on the quarter, was that 6% or 6.5%? I just didn't get it all down.","William Rutherford","You know as we roll out the pieces that we do track, it's just under 6%.","Brian Wright","Just under 6%. Okay. Thank you.","Victor Campbell","And I think we got time for one last question.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Paula Torch of Avondale Partners.","Paula Torch","Thank you for fitting me in. So you gave us some great color on labor and cost but I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about potential for wage rate increases as we move into next year? Should we expect to see more of an inflationary environment on that front? And if so, could you talk more about your ability to manage through it? Thank you.","Samuel Hazen","Well, we have routine studies. This is Sam. We have routine studies that we do within each of our markets twice a year in order to understand our competitive positioning with respect to wages. And as we sort through those analysis and those different issues, we try to make timely adjustments. So as a routine we are making market specific adjustments to remain as competitive as we possibly can. So those are specific market issues. Across all HCA markets I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be some increase in wages in our trends over the next few years. I don\u2019t think it is anything that is overly material or something that we cannot manage through effectively. We obviously try to short cycle our commercial contracts in a way to line up with any acceleration in wages so that we can adjust our commercial pricing to sync up with overall pressures on inflation, mainly in the wage and then secondarily on the supply side. So I think from that standpoint we are in a pretty good spot as well. But right now we are of the mindset that our trends are generally reflective of current market conditions with maybe some modest acceleration in a few pockets here and there. But we think it's manageable in the short run.","Victor Campbell","All right. Paula, thank you very much. And I want to thank everyone and hopefully I didn\u2019t offend anybody from New Jersey with my comments earlier. It was not intended. Anyway, you all have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11018":["HCA Holdings, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor Campbell","All right. Thank you, Tony, and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I'd like to welcome everyone on today's call, also to those of you that are listening to our webcast. Here this morning with me is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milt, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. As always, the call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","Milton Johnson","All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on our call and webcast this morning. This morning, we issued our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release, and this morning's release also included our announcement of the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend, our three-year capital expenditure plan and guidance related to 2018 earnings expectations.","Before discussing the release and certain details of the quarter, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on our 2017 performance. During 2017, we continued to invest in our growth agenda as we focused on adding access points to our networks, broadening service line capabilities, and expanding our depth in clinical service offerings.","Over the course of the first three quarters of the year, our results were challenged by lower-than-expected volume growth and from losses associated from the effects of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We closed 2017 with a solid performance in the fourth quarter with same facility adjusted admission growth of 2.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.1% over 2016 fourth quarter, and we finished the year 2017 with adjusted EBITDA slightly over 2016. We believe our fourth quarter results position us well as we go into 2018.","On the cost side, I believe expense management was well executed, especially the improved results throughout 2017 in RE and turnover rates and contract labor. Labor rate growth was in line with our expectations for the year. Our clinical agenda remains robust, and I'm very pleased with our continued improvements and clinical outcomes as our investments in our clinical excellence programs are positively impacting care across HCA.","Based on the latest Leapfrog quality ratings, 70.2% of HCA hospitals received a grade of A or B while only 55.9% of non-HCA hospitals achieved such ratings. We also saw improvements in our patient experience performance in 2017.","We continue to advance technology initiatives in 2017. Big Data and mobility initiatives led the company's technology project portfolio. The use of our continuously expanding clinical date warehouse supports our clinical excellence program and positions us well for emerging approaches like artificial intelligence.","Over the next three years, the company plans to deploy approximately 100,000 add-ons [ph] as part of our nursing technology agenda. Our physicians increased their mobility used by more than 75% in 2017 as we continue to expand functionality to improve their workflow and access to information. We believe our emerging mobility capabilities and our clinical insights from our clinical data warehouse provide greater physician and nursing engagement and improved patient outcomes.","With respect to capital allocation in 2017, we continued our balanced approach by investing in capital expenditures in our existing markets, repurchasing our shares, and investing in acquisitions. We invested just over $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2017. We placed $1.1 billion of new capital in service in 2017, and project we will place $1.7 billion of new capital in service in 2018. We repurchased 2.05 billion of our stock in 2017 and expanded our healthcare footprint by acquiring eight hospitals and other health-related assets for $1.2 billion.","Now moving to fourth quarter, we finished the year with a solid note with fourth quarter EBITDA - adjusted EBITDA of $2.362 billion, a record quarter for adjusted EBITDA. I'll leave further discussion of performance in the quarter for Bill and Sam, but we are pleased with the overall results in volume, revenue growth, and expense management during the quarter. We also remain confident in our strategies and believe they will position us well for the future.","Moving to cash flows, we generated $5.426 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2017. We invested $3 billion in capital expenditures, distributed $448 million to non-controlling parties, producing free cash flow of approximately 2 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased just over $2 billion of our stock in 2017. HCA repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our stock or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares since the beginning of 2017.","As result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we currently estimate the company's effective tax rate in 2018 to be 25%, and estimate that the reduction in cash taxes in 2018 to be approximately $500 million. It is our plan to reinvest these expected savings into our markets and into workforce development. This morning we announced an increase in our capital spending plans for 2018 through 2020. Capital expenditures over the next three years are expected to increase by almost 30%, $2.3 billion more than the previous three years, to approximately $10.5 billion. We are making these investments to add capacity, improve facilities, add new facilities, and enhance technology. We anticipate these expenditures should drive growth and job opportunities.","With respect to workforce development, the company is increasing investments in four important areas over the next few years that we believe will create better opportunities for career growth for employees and better capabilities to serve our patients. These areas include, 1, investments in educational programs to improve the clinical abilities of our nurses and other caregivers; 2, tuition reimbursement for employees to support advancing their educational opportunities; 3, scholarship programs for qualifying employees and 4, an expanded family leave program. We anticipate spending up to 300 million over the next three years in these areas. We believe these programs will help increase patient experience and create more career opportunities for employees.","This morning, we also announced the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on the company's common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on the close of business on March 1, 2018. The initiation of our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in the financial strength of the company, and the consistency of the cash flow it generates. The announcement today reinforces our commitment to delivering value to shareholders, while investing for future growth.","I'll close my comments with a couple of follow-ups from 2018 guidance included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA, we expect to earn $8.45 billion to $8.75 billion in 2018, and our guidance assumes 2% to 3% volume growth, reasonable pricing, and well-managed expense growth. I'm looking forward to 2018, and believe the company is well-positioned to achieve our goals for the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rutherford","Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2018 financial guidance. Then I will turn call over to Sam for some comments on operations.","We are pleased with the fourth quarter results. Volume, intensity, and good expense management led to a solid quarter and a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 7.1% to $2.362 billion, up from $2.206 billion last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 20.4% versus 20.7% last year. However, same-facility adjusted EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year's fourth quarter.","In the fourth quarter, our same-facility admissions increased from 1.4% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 2.3%. During the fourth quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.4% respectively. This included both traditional and managed Medicare.","Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.4% on a same-facility basis and represented 34.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% and 0.6% respectively in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 6.4% in the quarter, representing 7.9% of our total admissions compared to 7.5% last year. Managed care and other, including exchange admissions declined 0.5% and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.","Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 5% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.6%, and outpatient surgeries increased 0.8% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. Same-facility hospital, managed care, and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 6.8% in the quarter. This increase is mostly explained by higher acuity as our same-facility managed care and other case mix increased 4.8% compared to the prior year.","Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $660 million in the quarter compared to the last year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $1.32 billion in the quarter, an increase of $280 million from the prior year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.78 billion, an increase of $380 million over the prior year period.","Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Same-facility salary, wages, and benefits per equivalent admission increased 2.7% over the prior year period, while same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.6% over the prior year. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 5.2% over the prior year period, primarily reflecting increases in various professional fee costs.","On health reform, our results have remained fairly consistent throughout 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we saw approximately 12,100 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 12,300 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full-year of 2017, our health exchange admission declined approximately 4% over 2016 levels, and represented about 2.6% of our total admissions. Our health exchange ER visits declined approximately 2.5% for the full-year of '17, and represent about 2.3% of our total ER visits. Health reform activity was generally in line with our expectations.","As reported, earnings per share for full-year 2017 was $5.95 as compared to $7.30 in the prior year. 2017 results include a non-cash increase in the company's provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. This estimate may be refined as further information becomes available.","In addition, the impact of the third quarter hurricanes unfavorably impacted results by an estimated $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share. The company also recognized an $82 million or $0.22 per diluted share tax benefit related to employee equity award settlements in 2017. 2016 earnings per share include benefits of $0.39 due to the Kansas City legal settlement, $0.41 due to tax benefits for employee equity award settlements, and $0.13 due to the completion of Federal Tax audits for 2011 and 2012.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.734 billion compared to $1.699 billion last year. For full-year '17, cash flow from operations was $5.426 billion, down $227 million from $5.653 billion last year, primarily from working capital changes. Capital spending for the year increased to $3.015 billion from $2.760 billion in 2016 as we continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities for the company.","Cash flow from operations of $5.426 billion less capital spending of $3.015 billion in distributions to non-controlling interest of $448 million resulted in free cash flow of $1.963 billion for 2017. And as Milton mentioned, we completed a little over 2 billion of share repurchases during the year. We had approximately 1.8 billion remaining in our $2 billion authorization as of December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.047 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.0 times. These cash flow and balance sheet metrics continue to be an important strength for the company.","So with that, I will move into a discussion about our 2018 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2018 consolidated revenues should range from $45 billion to $46 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.45 billion and $8.75 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year, and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for 2018. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1.5% to 2%, factoring a market basket changes, HCA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases.","Medicaid revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year. Managed and other revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%, and we anticipate operating expenses per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%.","Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate cash flow from operations between $6.2 billion and $6.5 billion. We anticipate capital spending of $3.5 billion for 2018 as we see continued opportunities to invest in our markets and in support of key strategic initiatives. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.2 billion, and interest expense to be approximately $1.8 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 355 million shares for the quarter, and earnings per diluted share guidance of 2018 is projected to be $8.50 and $9.","Earnings per diluted share guidance includes an estimated $50 million income tax benefit or $0.14 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements and an estimated $480 million or a $1.35 per diluted share related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but does not include losses or gains on sale facilities, losses or retirement to debt or legal claim costs.","So that concludes my remarks, and I will turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel Hazen","All right. Thanks, Bill. Good morning to everybody. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume results for the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. My comments will focus on our on same-facilities domestic operations. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, North Texas, and Capitol divisions, and conversely our East Florida and Far West divisions were weak. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down in the quarter. Eleven of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions; 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits; freestanding emergency room visits grew 20%, while hospital-based emergency room visits increased 1.6%.","Once again, growth was stronger in higher acuity visits, but we did see some solid growth in lower acuity visits also. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 2.5%. The company ended the year with 72 operational freestanding emergency rooms. We had 63 at the end of last year for 2016. Currently, we have 12 more that we expect to open at 2018 and another 21 in 2019.","Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 6% and 3.5% respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 1.1%. Surgical admissions were 28% of total admissions in the quarter, consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were up also 1.1%. Volumes were up in both our hospital-based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Behavioral health admissions grew 3.2%. Rehab admissions grew 5.7%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined were up 2.5%. Births were down 2.4%, which was consistent with the trend we have seen for the entire year. Neonatal admissions however increased slightly at 0.6%. Urgent care business for the company were up 10% on a same-facilities basis and 29% in total. The company ended the year with a 123 urgent care centers in its networks, up from 80 at the end of the last year. We anticipate another 15 centers to 20 centers will open in 2018.","To recap the year, volumes across most categories and most divisions continue to grow. 2017 was the 10 consecutive year of same-facilities admissions and adjusted admissions growth for the company. Growth this year, as you heard, was slightly off our plan, most of the variants was explained we believe about low birthrates and less growth in emergency room visits. We remain confident about the prospects for long-run growth across HCA's portfolio of markets. As I have stated before, we believe healthcare demand for services in our markets will over time grow on average around 2% to 2.5% annually. We believe this demand is driven by the following factors: First, population growth; second, utilization increases driven by the aging of baby boomers; third, growth in chronic conditions; and fourth, strong and diverse market economies resulting in job growth.","As you heard, we are investing more in our growth agenda with a planned ramp up in capital spending. We believe this increase in spending is compelling for a variety of reasons. First, we need to address inpatient capacity constraints. Inpatient occupancy levels for the company ended the year at an all-time high of almost 72% of operational beds. Over the past three years, we have added approximately 1,350 inpatient beds to our markets. We expect to add approximately 2,000 beds in the next three years. Second, within our existing markets, we are adding more outpatient facilities and creating a comprehensive and diverse array of facility offerings. Currently, we have approximately 1,800 outpatient facilities and clinics across the company; we estimate that we should have over 2000 by 2020. And finally, we are investing more in clinical technology and other types of technologies to enhance quality outcomes and experience for our patients, to improve the environment in which our nurses deliver care, and to make our facilities to preferred place to practice for physicians.","In sum, we believe capital spending should allow us to capitalize on the growth and demand, drive gains and market share, and yield a positive return. I said this last quarter and I want to say it again, we continue to refine and enhance our efforts and our execution systems to improve and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, create a better environment for our employees to work, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace, sustained growth, and thus drive shareholder value.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Vic.","Victor Campbell","All right. Thank you, gentlemen. One quick thing Bill did want me to correct when he was giving you the average diluted shares in guidance for 2018, $355 million, I think he said quarterly, he obviously meant the full-year.","All right. With that, Tony if you come on and pole for questions, and since we have so many on the call I do encourage you to hold your questions to one at a time.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. Sam had made a comment about attributing some of the weakness in 2017 to softness in vertical rates and ER visits. So, when you go back and look at your guidance for same-store growth in 2018, are you assuming that those particular trends that caused the weakness last year improved? Or, is it related to some of the CapEx investment or some changes in the local competitive environment? And then, also just any comments on the 340B payment? Is that built into your assumption? Thank you.","Victor Campbell","Okay, thank you. Bill, you want to do 340B, and then Sam will talk about -","Bill Rutherford","Yes, Frank, 340B would be built into our 1.5% to 2% Medicare growth rates we talked about.","Victor Campbell","All right. Sam?","Samuel Hazen","We are assuming at some level, Frank, that there will be a slight rebound in both of those areas. And that will help prop up the overall demand. We do believe, however, that there are other factors driving our guidance with respect to volume. And that is capital spending. Yes, our investment in outpatient facilities and physician strategies also and numerous other initiatives that have been sort of our core approach to the market all along. And we think those elements will allow us to recover market share gains again and ultimately compete, I think, in a marketplace that we believe is starting to recover slightly from where it was over the past 18 months and that's sort of our thinking.","Victor Campbell","Thank you, Frank.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just try to ask about the M&A environment, consolidation environment. You are obviously coming off a great year on acquisition, a pick-up from recent years. Can you just tell us what you are seeing in terms of additional discussions? And then, on the flip side to the whole consolidation story is what we are seeing some of the non-profit big assistance consolidate. Does that present any opportunities or challenges for you guys? What is your perspective on that?","Victor Campbell","All right, AJ, thank you. I think Bill wants to lead with that one.","Bill Rutherford","Yes, with respect to the pipeline, AJ, we continue to have a lot of potential transactions that we are looking at. As you know, from following HCA, we are very disciplined with respect to acquisitions. We set pretty high bars as far as the characteristics of the market and asset positioning within the market. So - but we do have a pipeline. We are pleased with the number of transactions we were able to complete in 2017. Of course, we have the Savannah Memorial Health coming online probably within two days, on the 1st of February.","And we are very excited about entering that new market and the prospects for our future in Savannah. With respect to some of the other consolidation activities, we don't see that having at this point a major impact on our outlook. We are not - when you think about those consolidations, we are not adding new competitors in any of our markets. They do may get benefit from scale. But again here over the intermediate term, we don't foresee those transactions that have been announced having an impact on our outlook.","Victor Campbell","All right, thanks AJ.","Operator","Next from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning guys. Sam, you talked about expanding the outpatient side as part of your CapEx strategy. How should we think about what the outpatient strategy is? Meaning what areas should we be looking at in terms of where the capital is going? And how do you view that in the grand scheme of things? The healthcare environment changes with United rolling out MedExpress and Walgreens facilities and CVS Aetna as well.","Victor Campbell","All right. Sam?","Samuel Hazen","First, let me say this when you think about the total spend that the company is incurring and forecasting over the next few years at 3.5 billion, obviously the biggest component of that is on our inpatient chassis where we have to add beds and other infrastructure capabilities, the aspects of outpatient facilities and such is obviously low capital cost per unit. And so, I think in the overall scheme of our capital budget, outpatient will never supplant - not never, institution is strong, unlikely to supplant sort of our spending on our inpatient facilities.","It's important to understand that HCA has roughly 180 hospitals across the company. And like I said in my comments, we have about 1800 outpatient facilities already. And expect that to grow to about 2000 in 2020. The way we think about our outpatient strategy is looking at the hospital as an individual entity with outpatient offering if you will, for example, free standing emergency rooms attached to certain hospital, physician clinics attached to certain hospital, urgent care wrapped around all of that attached to certain hospital and certain components of the market.","So, we look at all of these micro systems if you will. And they are centered around this notion of us needing to be comprehensive including ambulatory surgery and certain imaging capabilities in an outpatient environment. The outpatient space has always been competitive. In many markets, there is no certificate need on outpatient facilities today. And we continue to be, we think, responsive to the marketplace with our approach and our strategy. Our belief is that having a fully integrated network of inpatient facilities, emergency room, outpatient facilities, physician clinic is a very synergistic platform for achieving a growth, for better patient experience, for technology and information flow and so forth.","And so, the care coordination process becomes a better method inside of an integrated system. And that's how we are thinking about it. And that's why we are investing, I think, consistently on both the inpatient side as well as the outpatient side. And I'll end with this, as we grow our outpatient facilities and activities, we have to have downstream capacity available in the inpatient space in order to receive the business that may start somewhere else in our network. That has been an ongoing effort inside of HCA to improve care coordination and try to keep the patient in the HCA system when they need further care downstream. So that's our approach. That's our strategy. We think it's responsive to the consumer, our physicians, and the marketplace as a whole.","Victor Campbell","All right. Sam, thanks. Brian, thank you.","Operator","Next is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Obviously a much stronger fourth quarter versus your expectations. If you had to run through your dots on the drivers of upside in terms of splitting out between volume and price versus cost, the cost [Technical Difficulty] how would you split that out? And then if I can just squeeze a quick question on the interest deductibility, can you tell us what the adjustment should be to 2018 EBITDA that you're guiding to if we should multiply by the 30% number for interest deductibility and tax reform? I think it might be little different than the reported number. Thanks.","Milton Johnson","Maybe let me take the first question.","Victor Campbell","Okay.","Milton Johnson","To break it down, I mean, Justin, with the performance we had in the fourth quarter, obviously, the contribution - the improvement in volume, the acuity of that volume yielding a very good break on the volume on top of I think a highly effective cost management quarter contributed to the upside. And it's hard to maybe parse it out and break it, but it is one of those quarters where we really were pleased with the performance across all those metrics that are important to kind of produce this sort of result and beat the expectations for fourth quarter.","But again, I am very pleased with the management team, our operators in the field and others that really like I said in my comments, we saw softer volumes in the first part of the year. We faced the hurricane and then in this fourth quarter to see solid volumes on top of really effective cost management, and again, the acuity growth in terms of that volume contributing to rate. So across the board, I think you would have to give credit to all three dimensions for the success of the quarter.","Victor Campbell","Thanks, Bill.","Bill Rutherford","And Justin this is William, the interest deductibility and the EBITDA year, we don't see any phase out the of the interest deductibility of any material nature in the first five years of the tax and jobs cut.","Victor Campbell","All right. Justin, thank you.","Justin Lake","Thank you guys.","Operator","Next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to focus back on the process around capital spending a little bit. Sam, can you just elaborate for how you guys analyze projects? How you prioritize your projects? And maybe just comment on the new areas of investment. How the returns compare versus historical returns and hurdle rates? Thanks.","Victor Campbell","All right, Sam?","Samuel Hazen","Well, we haven't really changed our process on capital spending for the last five or six years. I think we have a very comprehensive approach and a very detailed approach that we believe yields positive returns. And we have got a history of proving that, we believe. The process that begins with what I'll call capacity and utilization metrics that indicate to us where are we approaching a constraint that might prevent us from being able to grow in a particular market and like I said on the inpatient side, right now, we're running at almost 72% on average, which includes weekends when obviously hospitals do not have as many patients in them typically.","Inside of our emergency rooms today or in 2017, we averaged 88% of our utilization target. That was our capacity utilization there. And so those are fairly tight metrics that we start with. The second thing we do is look at the growth opportunities within the particular market, whether it's a population trend, a physician group opportunity, a particular service line opportunity, a technology requirement, whatever the case may be to support our initiatives. We're evaluating that in the context of that particular market's dynamics.","And then from there, we go through a process that still base initially, works its way up to me and the team up here, where we incorporate corporate perspectives before we sign off on a particular project. Our approach, like I said, has been to deliver sufficient capital to ensure that our facilities are maintaining their equipment and their curb appeal appropriately. That's our routine bucket as we typically call it and that average is probably 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, let's just say. Then, we have about 250 million or so that we have for our IT initiatives that Milton alluded to in his comments and then the balance typically is centered around execution of our growth agenda, whether it's capacity on the inpatient or outpatient facilities.","Again, we think our model is diverse. We're not investing in any concentrated fashion in any particular market. It's very distributed across HCA number one. Number two, it's distributed across hospitals within those markets. Number three, it's distributed across service watch, so we have a very conservative approach to capital allocation we believe across the portfolio of the markets.","And then finally, I'll say this. Our belief is that adding capital to existing businesses, existing facilities, especially our inpatient operations is very synergistic. The fixed costs are largely intact. The medical staff is already there. The clinical reputation is there competitively in the market and then we have the network around it to support those investments and those projects tend to produce very positive returns for us. We did a study just recently where we went back and looked at all of our major projects over the past three or four years and with the exception of a couple of scenarios, we were exceeding our expectations, including an embedded organic growth component. So we're very pleased with the outcomes of our projects. It gives us confidence as we go forward and expand the overall spending levels for the company.","Operator","Next to Michael Newshel at Evercore ISI.","Michael Newshel","Can you remind us and sort of size how much EBITDA contribution you're expecting from last year's acquisitions and also how much margin expansion that you're baking into that or what trajectory that you expect the margins on those deals to get up to the existing base.","Bill Rutherford","The acquisitions will contribute roughly 70 to 100 basis points of growth next year. We've factored that in to our guidance. In the first year, they will come in at modest margins and so there will be a slight dilution effect overall as a company, we still anticipate around a margin maintenance after those acquisitions.","Operator","Next to Chris Rigg at Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg","Just wanted to ask about the London hospitals. I know there are pressure points in the first half of '17. That pressure moderated I think in the third quarter, not sure what happened in the fourth quarter and would love to get a sense for how you expect results there to trend in 2018.","Samuel Hazen","We did not perform well in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit below our expectations and you're right. We had a better third quarter than previous first half of the year, but unfortunately, we had a really difficult December in London and our results on a year-over-year basis were down $12 million when you look at it in US dollars. So it's not that tremendous. But we do think we're approaching, I'll call it the bottom and have the right strategies, both on the top line as well as restructuring our operations over there from a cost standpoint to respond to the marketplace and create a more stable environment for us as we go into 2018.","Operator","Next to Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Can you talk a little bit about payer mix? Commercial seemed a little bit better this quarter, but still slightly down. Do you expect or what do you assume for commercial volume in 2018 and then the 6.8% yield on commercial, a pretty hefty number there, would you say we should focus more on that metric and sort of the revenue contribution of commercial as opposed to the volume metrics, just given the push by managed care to kind of push more of the lower acuity volume out of the inpatient setting?","Bill Rutherford","Ralph, this is Bill. I'll start. And then Sam or Milt can add on. We're duly pleased with the fourth quarter. We did see an improvement in the payer mix. As we mentioned, we had 0.5% growth in our managed and other on an adjusted admission basis. I would say going into 2018, we would expect a modest improvement in our commercial trends for next year. We've got that factored in to our guidance. You're right, the fourth quarter on a revenue per adjusted admission was high, it was all driven by acuity and case mix as we mentioned. I think over the longer period of time, as we indicated in our guidance that will settle in more in that 4% to 5% range over a period of time and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. So that's what I think is best case to model our commercial book to look at.","Milton Johnson","Our commercial rates are consistent and '18 versus last couple of years. So again, the case mix in this quarter obviously was a boost to that rate, but as Bill said, we think somewhere in the 4% to 5% zone would be a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Next to Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America.","Kevin Fischbeck","Just wanted to ask a little bit about tax reform and how you guys are thinking about it, because it sounds like you're looking for about $0.5 billion of improved cash flow from tax reform, but you're taking up your CapEx number by $0.5 billion this year and it looks like on a three year number more like 900 million over the next few years, but you're not picking up your long term growth rate, so it seems like you're kind of spending all the tax reform benefit and not expecting an improvement in underlying operation. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and why this increasing CapEx is not increasing your view about the organic growth opportunity going forward.","Milton Johnson","Yeah. I mean, I think we currently believe that we can grow our business a net 4% to 6% EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA zone. The capital that we're investment - these are long term investments in our markets. We expect them to continue as we have in recent years produced solid returns in yields for us. And if we can accomplish that again, that's how we intend to grow that 4% to 6%. And you follow us for a year, historically an organic growth company and as Sam has mentioned in his comments, we operate in really very good markets for healthcare.","We see population growth, increase in chronic conditions, all the things that Sam mentioned and with the capacity constraints that we see in our markets, to continue to grow organically, we have to invest and I think we will drive very good returns off of those investments in the markets we're in. So, yes, we are increasing our capital spend, but I think the opportunities for us to sustain reasonable growth for our shareholders remains intact and not changing our growth expectations, but again, we've been saying for a number of years now, we think 4% to 6% is a reasonable zone for us.","With respect to tax reform, as you know, the free cash flow we're generating, we're able to now with adding the dividend, as you think about returning cash to shareholders, we have been historically doing that with share repurchase. This further diversifies our approach to returning cash to shareholders. Now with a dividend being appease of that, very pleased with that, but also as you can see, our first priority remains reinvesting back in our existing markets. And so with the step up in capital spending, again, pleased to do that and pleased to have that announced too. So I think it's a very well rounded approach to capital allocation and one that I think will yield very good returns to shareholders over the years ahead.","Operator","Next to Josh Raskin, Nephron Research.","Mary Shang","This is Mary Shang on for Josh today. I didn't hear anything on the floor and I'm sorry if it was a material challenge to volumes in the fourth quarter. We've been hearing it's been a more severe season and you're anticipating discontinued into the first quarter?","Samuel Hazen","Sure. The flu contributed somewhere around 0.5% to our admission statistic in the month or in the fourth quarter. Most of that did occur in December. And then, for our emergency room visits, I think it was about 0.9% of our activity was attributable to flu. So there was some modest element of flu activity in the quarter, but what was interesting, the non-flu volume, as Bill and Milton just spoke to was incredibly intense and acute and that's how we were able to deliver case mix index growth in the face of flu growth in the quarter. So really spoke to our core business being very strong in the period.","Operator","Next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Costa","Back to tax reform again, but a little bit of a different take on, my question is how do you see that impacting your conversations with managed care providers in terms of rate negotiations and also how does it impact your views of hospital purchases in terms of purchase price paid since the free cash flow goes up, even if EBITDA doesn't.","Samuel Hazen","We're not getting in the short run any significant change in negotiations with the managed care companies as a result of tax reform. We think there is still certain trends in our business, certain trends in their business and we don't believe that's going to radically change the discussion there. And as Milton indicated, we're 85% contracted in 2018 already. We're roughly 50% contracted in 2019 and around 25% to 30% in 2020. So we do have some open contracts out there, but we think that the discussion is more centered on the core business, and not necessarily the tax reform.","Bill Rutherford","And Peter I would just add that the managed care companies are benefiting from tax reform as well. So it's not just one side picking up the benefits. And on the M&A model, it's a factor in there, but as Milton talked about, our primary thing on the M&A is making sure we're in a strong market with a strategic asset. That's our primary focus in the acquisition side. Clearly, there might be some incremental benefit with historical versus perspective taxes, but that's more secondary in our analysis.","Operator","Next Ana Gupte with Leerink.","Ana Gupte","So as you look at the volume trends, which are really strong, congratulations, is this something that's going more to APA and you're picking up more share from your competitors or is this more sort of an industry wide trend. And to the extent that it's market share in the tax reform, is the playing field is getting more leveled with the not-for-profits, do you think that should again accelerate the volume growth going forward.","Samuel Hazen","We don't, at this particular point in time, have fourth quarter market share data, so it's difficult to say exactly how the quarter is stacking up from a market share gain standpoint. Our market share, as I've indicated in the past, and as the current data which is through the second quarter of 2017 indicates, it's stable and it hasn't been growing like it did in the previous periods as we've indicated in the past. So we're anxious to see what the third and fourth quarter data will show. We do believe that we have the right approach, however, to delivering market share gains again for the company, some of this is connected to all the points we've been making throughout this call. So we're very confident we think in our approach to our systems from one market to the other, being able to compete and hopefully gain market share.","What was the last question? I'm sorry. I think that you're right. Most of our competitors in HCA's markets are tax exempt systems that aren't benefiting from the tax reform act that was passed. And so for us, it does create an advantage by comparison to them and we think we're trying to utilize that advantage appropriately as Milton indicated with investments in our communities and investments in our workforce, so that we can deliver a better service to our patients and have the necessary capacity to really benefit from the growth strategies that we have.","Operator","Next is Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.","Gary Taylor","Nice quarter too that same store revenue growth fell into your range, which was good. My question is about same store revenue guidance, the 46% that you talk about, if we exclude '14 and '15 where the ACA was having a positive impact, really we have to go back to 2009 since the last time you approached the low end of that same store revenue growth range. So really you're telling us that you think the business will accelerate and it's very different message from what we hear from the rest of the industry and the growth headwinds that you've cited aren't new necessarily. So I guess the question is, how do you have confidence that 4% to 6% same store revenue isn't just incorporating some of the tailwinds you've talked about demographics, et cetera but is also appropriately contemplating some of the headwind for hospitals over the next several years.","Samuel Hazen","Gary, when we look at our domestic operation - our same stores domestic operation revenue in 2017 grew by 4.2%. And this was on sort of a slower growth platform that we've experienced in past years. So I think from the standpoint of total revenue growth, we're in a pretty good spot we believe with the guidance and with our experience. I'm not sure I understand your point vis-\u00e0-vis our actual performance this year.","Bill Rutherford","And Gary, can I add one more, you threw out kind of the health reform years, but recall on those health reform years, not only do we have the benefit of health exchanges, but as we said throughout that period of time, our organic non-health exchange was really robust during those period of times. So I'm not so sure, if you exclude those periods, we're below the 4 as a starting point holds up for us.","Operator","Next is Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Steve Tanal","But I guess just a follow-up on a couple of points. I didn't hear sort of the outlook on flu in 1Q. I mean, obviously, it looks like the flu has accelerated. If you could just give us some flavor for what you're expecting there and how that impacts the outlook. And then just on the CapEx plan, any color on sort of threshold IR hours that you could speak to or how you think about quantitatively deploying capital in some of the markets.","Milton Johnson","Steve, let me just say one thing. We don't provide guidance in a mid-quarter. So we won't really get into the flu for the quarter. Obviously, you can see the stats out with CDC and what have you, they're pretty strong. But we don't provide interim quarter guidance.","Bill Rutherford","I think on the CapEx, I think as Sam was describing the different types of capital investments, we clearly go through a pretty rigorous review of those looking at kind of the market demand, financial returns, and I would say that every project goes through its own analysis in terms of financial returns and internal rate of returns. Generally, when you're characterizing those growth investments that are either in patient capacity or even expansion of our outpatient network, they're meeting above company standards returns. And again as we look at it as a portfolio, we think we've got this consistent kind of track record of growing return on invested capital. So there is really no hard and fast kind of one threshold that we use. Each project and each type of project would generally stay on its own, but all of them generally would come with attractive returns that we factor in to our decision to go forward with the investment.","Operator","Thank you. We will take that final question from Sarah James at Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] for Sarah. So you touched on artificial intelligence in your prepared remarks. Can you dive a little deeper into how HCA is looking to apply this technology and how that will help you reduce the cost or improve the quality of your care?","Victor Campbell","All right. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Jon?","Jon Perlin","We took the opportunity to use meaningful years to replatform in a way that we can capture all of the data, every one of our clinical encounters. These clinical encounters provide really a lot of fuel for understanding quality and safety as well as efficiency in the capacity for growth. We used the artificial intelligence to do everything from changing workflow to making for efficient, for example, supporting patient application to identifying more efficient ways for care delivery. Early identifications have set us as such an example. So it's really fueled for supporting every aspect of our operations.","Victor Campbell","We will thank all of you for joining us and look forward to seeing you in the coming year.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning to everyone.","Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those listening to our webcast. With us here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operation. Several other members of the senior management team are here as well to assist during the Q&A session.","Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded. Replay of the call will be available later today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.","Richard M. Bracken","Thanks, Vic, and good morning to all, and thank you for joining our call. Today, the company reported first quarter earnings, which are in line with our pre-released expectations provided in our April 15 preview. Summary information concerning our first quarter performance was provided in our release this morning. And in just a moment, we'll provide a more detailed review of our first quarter performance. However, before we proceed to these analyses, let me provide a few general observations about the quarter.","As we identified in our releases, one of the most significant observations for the quarter was the slowing of patient volume growth from our recent trends. Growth in same facility inpatient admissions for the quarter was up only slightly at 0.1%, well below our historical trends. And, of course, from a more meaningful comparison, this rate needs to be adjusted for the leap year effect -- that is 1 less day as compared to last year's first quarter.","Doing so, same facility inpatient admissions for the quarter grew by 1.3%. Even though this rate has improved from the as-reported number, clearly, it was less than our recent trends. It should be noted that this is a slowdown in rate of growth also occurred in our outpatient volumes as reflected in our adjusted admissions performance.","Our analysis of first quarter volume related metrics has led us to the following general conclusions: The slowdown in inpatient volumes began mid-quarter with January's as-reported same facility admissions up 4.7%, February's down 3.6% and March's down 0.9%. Regardless of day alignment issues, performance clearly was challenged most in the month of February, and we did see some modest improvement sequentially in March.","The slower volume growth was felt across our portfolio of hospitals. However, it is interesting to note that roughly the same number of facilities did experience admissions growth in the quarter as compared to recent trends, but the growth that they did experience was generally less. And finally the slowdown in volumes was experienced across all payer classes and service lines. And Sam will provide more analysis of our Q1 volume metrics in just a moment.","Please note that we feel we're not in a position at this time to state definitively if the slowdown of volumes we saw in the second half of the first quarter is an anomaly or if it's just a start of a new trend. Additional time must pass to make this determination. Also, while typically we don't comment on current quarter metrics, given the volume issues in the first quarter, we thought it important to point out today that April's inpatient volumes, with the benefit of an additional business day, increased approximately 4% over prior year. This is more consistent with our expectations.","While our operating teams managed expense levels with the reduced volumes during the quarter, we maintain our investments in our service line strategies, technology and clinical improvement agendas. And we feel these investments are necessary for sustained growth over time.","And finally, as expected, this was a quarter with a significant amount of contracting activity for health exchange products. During the quarter, we have been in conversation with most every major payer in most every market. Our approach to exchange contracting has factored in assumptions, such as anticipated participation by individuals and exchange products, Medicaid expansion activities, uninsured market share and hospital occupancy rates, to mention just a few.","Our results today are as follows: Generally, we negotiate with health plans across roughly 37 markets. To date, in 27 of those markets, we have 36 contracts with our major payers and expect to be in active negotiations for additional contracts over the next several months. Currently, 85% of our hospitals are contracted with at least 1 exchange product. We have 17 -- we have contracts in 17 of our 20 largest uninsured markets. And in 9 markets, we will participate in multiple exchange products. Of the 36 contracts, 16 include some form of network configuration. And although we are not going to comment on the specific rates associated with executed contracts, they generally can be characterized as closer to commercial pricing than Medicare. And in some cases, exchange contracts had been coupled with term extensions of other managed care agreements that we might have with any given payer.","As I stated on our last quarter's call, we believe this will be a process that evolves over time. Although we are still in the early stages of America's reform agenda, the exchange contracting results to date have been within our expectations. We are encouraged by the dialogue we have had with the payer community and believe that exchange products, over time, will create value for our organization.","And finally, yesterday, HCA signed an asset purchase agreement with Carondelet Health to purchase their 2 hospitals, St. Joseph and St. Mary's Medical Centers in Kansas City. We are pleased with the execution of this agreement and are looking forward to adding these organizations to our company.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson","Thank you, and good morning. I hope most of you have had a chance to review our first quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding the first quarter results and then we'll take your questions.","As Richard mentioned, our first quarter results fell short of our internal expectations, primarily due to lower patient volumes, especially outpatient volumes. Cash expenses also came in well below plan due to less volume and management actions taken in the quarter. However, we were not able to fully offset the revenue impact of the volume softness with expense management. Following my comments, Sam will provide additional observations on patient volume and management's actions.","Revenues in the first quarter increased to $8.44 billion, up 0.4% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Excluding the net favorable Medicare settlements in the first quarter of 2012 of $188 million, revenues increased 2.7% over the prior year's first quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.568 billion compared to $1.823 billion in the first quarter of 2012, which included a net favorable impact from the Medicare settlements of $170 million. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. totaled $344 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to $540 million or $1.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.","First quarter of 2013 results include pretax losses from the sales of facilities of $16 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The first quarter also includes a pretax loss of $17 million or $0.03 per diluted share on the retirement of the $201 million principal amount of our 9 7\/8% senior secured second lien notes due in 2017.","Volume trends in the quarter moderated from recent growth rates with same facility admissions increasing 0.1% and same facility equivalent admissions declining 0.7% as compared to last year's first quarter. Our same facility medical admissions increased 1.2%, while same facility surgical admissions declined 3.2% compared to the prior year. Excluding the extra business day due to leap year in 2012, our same facility admissions increased 1.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.4%.","During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.5% and 1%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased to 12.5% on a same-facility basis and represent 28.9% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same facility Medicaid admissions were flat with prior year, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.2% compared to the prior year. Same facility managed care and other admissions declined 3.2% in the first quarter, while same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions declined 4.6% compared to the prior year's first quarter.","In the first quarter, uninsured admissions increased 5.4% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 7.4% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7% in last year's first quarter.","Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.8% in the quarter. Excluding the leap year effect, same facility emergency visits increased 4.9%. Same facility surgeries declined 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting a decline of 2.6% in our same facility inpatient surgeries and a 4.3% decline in our same facility outpatient surgeries. Adjusting for leap year, same facility inpatient surgeries declined 1.5% and outpatient surgeries declined 3.2% compared to the prior year's first quarter.","During the quarter, revenue rate growth per equivalent admission improved compared to recent trends. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.8% in the first quarter. However, excluding the impact of the net favorable Medicare settlement in 2012, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5%. This is partially due to an increase in our average length of stay and our case mix, a measure of inpatient acuity, which increased 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.","For the first quarter, same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 3.7%. However, after excluding the Medicare settlement revenue from the prior period 2012, Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.6%.","Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 0.4%. Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.5% over the prior year period, the highest quarterly growth rate yield on our managed care revenue in several quarters.","Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $418 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. During the first quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $905 million, an increase of $108 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.947 billion, an increase of $310 million from the prior year period.","Now moving to expenses. As I mentioned earlier, cash expenses came in well below plan, but on a volume-adjusted basis, growth rates were greater than recent trends, primarily due to the moderation in volume growth. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.3% compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense, excluding HITECH expenses and Medicaid waiver program expenses, increased 4.8% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year.","As I referenced earlier in my comments regarding our revenue rate growth, higher case mix and average length of stay also contributed to the growth in operating expense per equivalent admission.","Salaries per equivalent admission increased 4.1% on a same facility basis. Same facility productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission deteriorated 1.8% over the prior year period and same facility wage growth was 2% in the first quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $9 million of 3.3% from the previous year's first quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter over last year's first quarter.","Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from a reduction and supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $41 million and contributed 290 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the first quarter. The reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.","Same facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior period -- prior year period. We recognized $39 million in electronic health record incentive income in the first quarter compared to $55 million in the first quarter of last year. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $26 million and $17 million in EHR-related expense in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively.","Cash flows from operating activities totaled $740 million in the quarter compared to $797 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the net impact of the $201 million less in net income, being partially offset by $50 million benefit from changes in working capital items and $50 million benefit from income taxes in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Days in accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter were 52 days compared to 53 days for the same period last year.","At March 31, 2013, the company's debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.56x compared to 4.43x at December 31, 2012. And at the end of the quarter, we had $2.575 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities.","We are in the process of repricing certain of our bank term loans. We recently closed on the repricing of our $2.373 billion Term Loan B3, which has a maturity of May 1, 2018, and reduced the credit spread on that loan from 325 basis points to 275 basis points. This will reduce our interest expense by $11.9 million annually over the life of the loan.","Additionally, we are currently in the process of repricing our $2 billion Term Loan B2, which has a maturity of March 31, 2017, and expect to reduce the credit spread on that loan from 325 basis points to 275 points as well. This repricing, if successfully completed, will reduce our interest expense by $10 million annually over the life of the loan.","I do want to spend just a moment addressing the Medicare IPPS proposed rule, which was issued by CMS last Friday afternoon. As you recall, on our fourth quarter call, we had sized a potential reduction in our Medicare disproportionate share payments under the Affordable Care Act starting in October 2013 of approximately $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $200 million annually. The proposed rule issued last week utilized what we believe is a more appropriate DSH reallocation formula, which will result in Medicare DSH payments at approximately the same level as this year.","Also, the proposed rule reduces inpatient payments for the government's fiscal year beginning October 1, 2013, by 0.8% related to a documentation and coding recruitment adjustment in accordance with the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which was passed on New Year's Eve.","During our prior call, we estimated this payment reduction at approximately $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $100 million on an annual basis. Under the proposed rule, our documentation and coding recruitment cut would be approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 or approximately $52 million on an annual basis. I do want to remind everyone that this is still a proposed rule, not a final rule, which we anticipate would be published sometime in August.","Before turning the call over to Sam, I want to mention that Parallon exceeded first quarter expectations, and the implementation of LifePoint Hospitals for both supply chain and revenue cycle services is proceeding according to plan.","Now let me turn the call over to Sam.","Samuel N. Hazen","Good morning. I want to focus my comments this morning on the analysis we conducted on our first quarter volumes and the observations we are able to make at this point in time. Before I get into this, I want to give you a short summary of the 2012 third quarter market share performance for ATA. This summary is for the 12 months ended September 30, 2012, which is the most recent market share data available.","For this period, inpatient market share for ATA increased to 23.5%, an improvement of 58 basis points over the previous year. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets was flat on a year-over-year basis. We had share gains in 14 out of 17 service lines. The company gained share in 29 out of 37 markets, with gains in 8 of its top 10 markets. In the commercial segment, market share grew by 38 basis points. And finally, within the in-migration segment of our business, market share improved by 53 basis points.","During this 12-month period, the gains in the third quarter of 2012 accelerated, as compared to the other quarters in the study. Now let me move to the first quarter volumes.","We conducted a thorough analysis of the 5 major factors that drive our volumes to see if we could identify any significant issues that would indicate an adverse change in market share performance. In short, we could not.","As is typical, there were situations in a few markets where we believe our market share declined in the quarter, but there were also situations in other markets where we are confident that we gained share. The factors that we evaluated were as follows: First, we evaluated our managed care network contracts. There were no changes in our managed care contracts that reduced our access to commercial or governmental business, nor do we believe managed care companies are steering their business away from HCA facilities. To date, HCA has contracted for approximately 60% of 2014 managed care revenue and 40% of 2015 managed care revenue at rates consistent with the past few years.","The second factor that we analyzed was the number of physicians on our active medical staff. In the first quarter, the number grew by almost 1% as compared to the end of the last year. This is consistent with past periods. The company continues to invest significantly in its physician integration initiatives and in its clinical improvement initiatives.","The third factor we assessed was our core operations and organizational efforts that support our growth agenda. For example, we studied the average wait times in HCA emergency rooms. They were essentially identical to those in the fourth quarter. Our outreach resources and efforts were as planned, so there were no indications of problems in these areas of our evaluation.","The fourth factor we reviewed was a portfolio performance analysis for our domestic operations, which we adjusted to reflect the effects of leap year. In 2012, 69% of our hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions. In the first quarter of 2013, 62% of our hospitals had growth. There was a slight weakening overall, but it was not material, nor was it concentrated in a particular market.","To give you some perspective on the trends across the company's markets, the only state among our top 15 volume states that had a positive relationship between first quarter growth rates and 2012 growth rates in inpatient admissions was California. The growth rates in both Florida and Texas decelerated at a comparable level. When we conducted the same portfolio analysis for adjusted admissions, it is clear that the trends in outpatient volumes changed the most. In 2012, 77% of our hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. In the first quarter of 2013, only 56% of our hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions.","The final factor we analyzed was our competitors' actions. In general, there were no changes identified that would have caused an overall trend change for the company. There were a few specific markets where certain investments by our competition related to new hospitals had an adverse impact on our volumes, but these situations were limited and not broad based.","As a result of this analysis, we believe the first quarter calendar changes related to leap year, Easter and New Year, had a pronounced effect on our volumes and explain much of the deceleration in growth. In particular, outpatient surgery volumes, outpatient diagnostic volumes and to a lesser degree, commercial admissions were most affected by this calendar change. Most of these volumes are generated on weekdays. Also, our behavioral and rehab businesses tend to be more weekdays oriented. The growth rate in these service lines slowed in the first quarter also.","With respect to expense management, the company started responding to soft volume trends in late February. These efforts were accelerated in early March when it became apparent that the trends were not improving. Our actions included appropriate flexing of variable staffing and reductions in the use of premium labor. In certain situations, we reduced our workforce with more permanent measures.","And finally, the company has redoubled its efforts to limit overhead additions, postpone certain initiatives and restrict discretionary spending. Our management teams have been very effective in the past with implementing these type of measures and we are confident in our ability to execute.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell","All right, Sam, thank you. And if we can move to Q&A, Jessica, you want to come back on?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So question on exchange contracting. Can you talk specifically about Blue Cross Blue Shield contracting given the expectation they're likely to have significant market share on exchanges? And then you also said your rates look more like commercial than Medicare. As a level set, can you tell us how your current commercial rates compare to Medicare on average?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, you want to lead and then, Juan?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Generally, probably half of our contracts would be with Blue Cross entities. And with respect to the pricing, our revenue per equivalent admission averages, with commercial, probably around $18,500 to $19,000, and Medicare is usually around $10,000 to $10,500 per equivalent admission.","Victor L. Campbell","And Juan anything to add?","Juan Vallarino","No, I'm good.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just on the exchange topic. Can you maybe help us talk about what happens in the event that you aren't included in a narrow network product on exchange. Would you just bill at the out-of-network rate for anyone that comes to you, I guess? And then secondly, are there provisions in your existing contracts that would allow you to exit an existing managed care relationship if you weren't included in exchange product or would you have to wait for that contract to end?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Juan, you want to take that?","Juan Vallarino","Ralph, good questions on both. On the out-of-network, we would get out-of-network payments and we would bill it -- bill charges, we were not in the network. And to answer the second question, we'd have to wait. We'll have to issue a notice of, what is it, 180-day -- whatever the contract allows for.","Operator","We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess I'll ask a more mundane, immediate question and leave the 2014 questions to others. The cost initiative that you put in place, can you expand on that a little bit more in terms of what it might mean? I know you guys had a big cost reduction program back in the second quarter of 2011 after a tough quarter. Is what we're talking about, that you implemented something similar to that, maybe use that as a way to gauge it?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen","Well, I think there are similar elements to what we've done this year versus what we did in the past, A.J. I think the thing that we dealt with in the quarter is typically you have seasonal labor related to certain traveler contracts and so forth to deal with expected volume levels, you have to make commitments to those contracts in advance and you tend to have a runoff on those contracts. So we had to work our way out of those contracts first and foremost as quickly as we possibly can to get rid of the premium labor that was there to take care of the volume that did in fact show up as expected. From there, we approach it as we typically do. We make sure our headcount is consistent with where our expectations are related to volumes as we see them over the remaining portion of the year. Again that required some adjustments, both in our variable staffing, as well as some fixed staffing in certain situations where we made some judgments that the volumes had trended down more than we anticipated, and we're going to take a conservative view on that. And we have been able to significantly impact our headcount per patient over the last 45 to 60 days as compared to where we were in January. And it's important to understand we had record census in January at many of our hospitals. And as the flu burned off, we had dramatic drops in census 10%, 12% in inpatient census for some of our facilities. And it's not easy to adjust downward that quickly when we see that kind of migration out of our hospitals because of one particular condition. With respect to our other cost initiatives, they continue to be productive for the company, and we think they will continue to produce some incremental benefit as we move through the year. Those involve supply chain initiatives as you know, there are certain clinical initiatives that we think will enhance our cost structure. And so we anticipate similar transitions between quarter-over-quarter performance as we've seen in the past to line up with the volume expectations for the remaining portion of the year.","Richard M. Bracken","The only thing -- this is Richard. The only thing I would add to that, A.J., is that in addition to the sort of the real-time actions that Sam described, we have made some significant structural changes in our approach to expense management that tries to move our best practices across the enterprise. You might recall we refer to this as our performance improvement program. We started this almost 5 years ago. We have now 60 dedicated employees that are on the road to targeted hospitals throughout the year. We typically get to, not quite 20, around 15 to 20 hospitals. These teams stay at the facility sometimes 3 months. They monitor on a detailed basis any number of variables, labor staffing, best practices, supplies, and even our clinical agenda and improvements in our clinical variation are also included in these reviews. So in addition to the daily work that our management teams do that adjusts variable expenses, we have a system in place that deals -- tries to deal with pulling out more structural costs and has been very successful for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So the acquisitions in Kansas City have been in the works for a while here, but can you just kind of remind us of your views on uses of capital going forward? And maybe how the acquisition pipeline is looking?","Richard M. Bracken","Let me just comment on acquisitions -- this is Richard again -- for just a second. Milton might want to add some more on our other uses of capital. But relative to acquisitions, we, of course, remain very interested in pursuing strategic acquisitions. And as we have mentioned many times in the past, following reinvestment in our existing assets, strategic acquisitions are considered a priority use of our capital. We continue to consider these opportunities as they present themselves. And as you know, this is an unpredictable process. They mature in the marketplace at different rates and in different markets and we have to consider them all independently. We prefer acquisitions or even partnership opportunities that are complementary to our existing strategy. Large urban markets, for example. We like acquisitions that can maximize benefit from our existing infrastructure. For example, domestic versus international. And we really are looking towards acquisitions and markets where over time, we believe that we could achieve a meaningful share presence. So having said all of that, and those are sort of our desires, we are aware of most all material opportunities that might present themselves in the marketplace. And as such, we're able really to take a look at most everything. Just to close on sort of growth through development. Our primary strategy, as you know, has been sort of based on the organic capacity within our markets, and in investing in those markets, we are pleased that we're in markets that tend to grow faster and have a lot of population concentration. We now have 4 hospitals under construction in Salt Lake City area, Orlando, Houston and Fort Worth. And typically, and including these kinds of developments, we add somewhere between 400 and 500 beds a year of capacity. So this, in combination with a robust operating strategy that Sam mentioned, has really resulted in positive share gains. But we think about acquisitions, we have tuned up our acquisition development department. We're looking at everything that's out there and we're -- we proceed as we think we can make sense out of them.","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, do you want to talk more on...","R. Milton Johnson","I think that's a good description.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The volumes -- I just wanted to clarify, when you gave the monthlies, those were not adjusted for leap year, right? So that February comp of  down 3.6%, would that be closer to flat with leap year?","Victor L. Campbell","None of those were adjusted. Those were as reported. So you sort of have to go through and apply your leap year. Everybody sort of does it a little bit differently, so we'll let you have the actuals that we've given you for those months. But clearly, there were moving parts in all of them.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then the 5 factors that Sam went through, you mentioned the managed care contracting and no changes, et cetera. But are you seeing any changes in benefit design or deductibles or things like that, that you think may be impacting the consumer as opposed to the actual managed care contract itself?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, you want to lead?","Samuel N. Hazen","Well, I think there are some indications that there are more co-pay and deductible responsibilities out there with our patients than in the previous year. Is it materially different on a year-to-year basis? We're not seeing that in a material way in our accounts receivable activity. Milton, I think we had some increase in the amount of co-pay and deductible per account. But it wasn't yet so significant that it would suggest that it's the primary reason around deceleration in the market. There are reasons to believe that the outpatient volumes are more under pressure with respect to deductible and co-pay changes than inpatient volume. But it's not so material in our look inside of our receivables that would suggest that, that's a primary reason for any deceleration.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes. And maybe I can just give you a few numbers on what Sam's referencing. So I can just give you some of the collection numbers as well. So in the first quarter of this year versus last year, we actually collected 2.9% more in patient cash collections than we did in the first quarter of 2012. As far as upfront collections, we were up 1.1% over last year. When you look at the upfront collection rate, in other words, the average payment per account, it did go up, but Sam's referencing 7.9%, so the average is about $257 versus $238 a year ago. And -- but generally, our collection efforts are going well. Again, patient cash collection's up almost 3%, upfront collection is still up. So it's really the volume of upfront collections did decline a little bit, about 6%, in accordance with some of the volume changes.","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess just 2 quick ones. One, can you remind us of some of the nuances to consider and difference in the characteristics as you shift from traditional Medicare and you see those patients more and more in Managed Medicare? And then just on the exchanges, to the degree you're in networks, are you exclusive with that payer or you can -- can you sign up other payers and be in their networks as well?","Victor L. Campbell","Okay, Juan, do you want to take those?","Juan Vallarino","We're not exclusive to any payer, let's put that one aside. And the shift from Medicare to Medicare Advantage, the payment schemes are usually the same. So it's really -- well medical management the plan may or may not play from that patient. But from our perspective there's very little difference.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","From a volume standpoint, very little difference or do you see some sort of an impact typically?","Samuel N. Hazen","It's hard to judge that with 28% of the total population and in some markets it's even significantly less than that. In other markets a little bit higher especially in South Florida. That -- the overall demand for Medicare business changes. Hard to see it on that small piece of the overall equation. I think it's reasonable to believe that there are some impact on demand when it moves from a traditional book of business to a managed book of business. But it's hard for us to quantify that and see that given the influx of new patients into the Medicare population. So it's very hard to discern that.","R. Milton Johnson","And I think typically the Managed Medicare population is the younger Medicare population, which may just have less demand by nature of their age.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Josh's question earlier. And one of your peers commented on this earlier this week with regards to the high deductible plans. I mean, can you talk bigger picture maybe if you've seen any change in sort of the seasonal pattern of earnings over the last couple of years, not just as it relates to this year because of the sort of the adoption rate in the high deductible side?","Victor L. Campbell","Okay. Sam, do you want to address that first?","Samuel N. Hazen","I do think we have seen over the past 3 or 4 years a slight movement into the latter half of the year, especially on outpatient volumes. We have seen our outpatient activity in the fourth quarter, in particular, third quarter, a little bit less, but some. A lot of activity in those areas, more on the commercial side. We tend to see a lot of commercial activity in our outpatient business to begin with. Our outpatient surgery as a whole runs about 50% commercial business. Our emergency rooms run around 30% and our outpatient imaging tends to have a pretty good payer mix as well. So as you look at the trends over the past few years, you do see more of a shift towards the latter half of the year on the commercial book of business in the outpatient segment. So can you attribute all that to deductibles and co-pay? Possibly. It's hard to really know, but we have seen some movement. I don't know that I can sit here and quantify it for you exactly, but I think it's fair to say that there has been a shift.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","On the heels of a difficult quarter, you all have put together a really terrific set of prepared remarks across everyone who spoke. You answered a lot of questions and addressed a lot of issues and I thank you for that. It makes it a lot easier. So my question is this. We've not talked about your guidance, which you've reiterated. Can you walk through with us how you get from the weakness in the first quarter to guidance being maintained? And specifically, if you wouldn't mind commenting on whether or not you're still including or guiding us to include the same level of DSH cut affecting fourth quarter given your commentary about the proposed rule? And, yes, I get that it's proposed and not final.","Victor L. Campbell","All right, Sheryl. And Milton, I think, is prepared for that comment.","R. Milton Johnson","Sure, I'll be happy to bridge our February 2013 guidance that we gave on the fourth quarter call to how we see it today. Of course, we're not revising our range of EBITDA guidance for the year. But we may get there on a slightly different pathway. For example, we gave guidance that our adjusted admission growth in 2013 would be 2% to 3%. I would say now we're -- our belief is that we will most likely come in at the low end of that range. With respect to our revenue rate, we gave guidance that we thought that we would have growth in 2013 between 1% to 2%. I would say now we think that, that number would be more in the 2% to 3% zone. So our -- when you look at our revenue growth overall, I think we're still looking at the same level of revenue growth, just a little less volume, but a little more rate. And then with respect to expenses, we had, I think, given guidance that we thought we would come in, all in, around 2.5% growth. And I would say now based on the first quarter performance, adjusting for HITECH, we reported 4.8%. I think now we're looking more at -- even after the cuts and action plans that we put in place, somewhere probably around 3% to 3.5% would be an expectation. We gave guidance at our overall Medicare rate for 2013, including sequestration, including what we thought the DSH cuts would be, including what we thought the productivity and coding adjustments would be. We said we thought it would be down in 2013, 1.2%. We now believe that would be closer to being down 0.6%, all in. And so with all of those -- there's some movements with the details, that still puts us within our EBITDA range for the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so I guess when we think about the cost initiatives and just trying to think about how -- it was helpful, that last comment about bridging the gap, but is there a thought that you kind of think Q2 here on that run rate or should we expect an acceleration of the cost saves as the year goes on?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam or Milton?","Samuel N. Hazen","Most of our actions were accomplished by the end of March. We had some residual actions that would affect us in the second quarter because of certain timing of events and so forth. So the majority of our efforts to adjust our costs to line up with what we felt our volumes were going to do for the rest of the year were accomplished by the end of March. And so you should see a full benefit of that as we move through the second quarter, assuming we get the volume we're anticipating. Obviously our per-unit metrics are very dependent upon volume because of the fixed cost nature of our business. Therefore, if it were little better we should see better cost per unit obviously and obviously a little worse if we don't get the volume. So the actions that we've taken were 80% implemented by the end of the quarter, and there's maybe 20% or 25% that wasn't implemented that most likely will be implemented sometime in April and we'll get the benefit of that going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just was hoping you might be able to update us on your process to evaluate the ACA impact. I know you've said that, that'll come later in the year. I guess just given all the uncertainties that still remain uncertainties, I'm curious about how that process is coming along. And if you've got any updates for us in terms of timing and format of that?","Victor L. Campbell","Milton, you?","R. Milton Johnson","Sure. Ralph -- Darren -- I'm sorry, Darren. We're not going to set a date for that information just yet. You referenced still a lot of uncertainties. Quite frankly, earlier in this year, late last year we thought there might be more certainty. Take, for example, expansion of Medicaid. Still, I think, a lot of uncertainty around that. And so -- and as we're making progress on our exchange contracting that's been helpful. But we're going to remain, I guess, uncommitted with respect to a date. But as we continue to get more clarity, we do expect either later this year, certainly no later than probably the time that we would issue 2014 guidance that we would be giving a multi-year view. But I'm not going to set an expectation for a certain date today.","Richard M. Bracken","And I'll just add, as we go, we're trying to -- each quarter we're trying to update with the relevant information as we did this morning, so as it unfolds for us over each quarter, we'll try to update you on key points.","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Market.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll follow up on the question related to Medicaid expansion in Texas. Let's just say for now Texas doesn't opt in. I'm wondering if you've had a chance to really look at the opportunity in Texas in the subsidy -- subsidized part of the market. My understanding is that 139% up to about 250% of the federal poverty level would actually qualify for essentially full subsidized coverage. So, I wonder what -- have you looked at that for you in Texas, like if we don't get Medicaid expansion, does that -- is that a big opportunity -- what segment of the market would that be for you and then how would you go about the process of outreach to sign that market up?","Victor L. Campbell","All right. I think, Milton, you win that one again.","R. Milton Johnson","Yes, if we don't see Medicaid expansion, and this is true for Texas, but also other states. We do expect you'll see more uptake from that population, especially at the lower wage rates and poverty level and they would come into the exchange a certain amount. So that, I think, would be a positive for us to help offset having fewer lives covered in a market. So I do agree with that and that's how we're thinking about it from a modeling standpoint, if, in fact, you don't see expansion.","Richard M. Bracken","And I would -- on that last piece of your question, where you said you know what, about enrollment in the marketplace. Let me just give you more general comment about how we're thinking about that. Of course, enrolling in these plans is important. And we've thought a lot about how we should proceed in this. We -- to that end, we engaged an outside group that's been working with us. Doing a lot of focus groups in key markets, understanding what activities might be in the given markets. We don't want to duplicate anything, make sure that any efforts that we would take would be complementary in nature. We're infusing that logic with all the quantitative research that we've done about the uninsured. And so we have a pretty robust set of analysis going on to figure out how we should participate in this effort. But we haven't obviously put anything out yet and we're continuing to fine-tune that effort. So more on that as we work through our processes.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just not to beat the volume topic to death, but let me just try one more. Have you looked at the pattern of prior serious flu seasons and, I guess, looking back -- I guess you had to go back 10 years ago, maybe, to that 2003, '04 season. Did volumes drop off as the flu abated there? Just wondering if there's some precedent on that front?","Victor L. Campbell","Sam, we're going to test your memory here.","Samuel N. Hazen","I can't give you any specifics on the flu from 10 years ago. I'll tell you this. For the quarter, our inpatient activity was positive by 0.5 point related to the flu. Our emergency room activity was down 0.5 point because of flu activity on a year-over-year basis. It's important to understand for HCA -- I was telling the team this before the call, our admission activity, our average daily census and our ER volumes in the first quarter of 2013 was the highest volume the company has had in 17 consecutive quarters. And probably if I had data in front of me beyond that, it would be even more -- it's probably the highest we've had since the Columbia\/HCA days when there was over 300 hospitals in the portfolio. So our overall volume was at a peak. Now it wasn't on outpatient activity that are dependent on calendar days and\/or surgical activities, which depend on calendar days, but our overall volume was very strong in aggregate. And so how the flu reacts, I mean, December in the fourth quarter for HCA of 2012 was a record year-over-year kind of growth on both inpatient activities and adjusted admission activity. A lot of which was driven by the flu we were seeing early in December in a lot of our states. So there was that kind of dynamic going on, too, where it straddled both 2012 and 2013. So it's really hard for me to give you any sense of it, but the flu does affect our business and it comes and goes, and it can be very short, it can be protracted. It's hard to say exactly how it's going to change from one period to the other.","Victor L. Campbell","Thank you. I'm debating with myself right here. We've had 12 questions.

Would be interested in your observations and maybe your thoughts on how you see the politics or the process playing out in Florida and Texas and how they decide on what they're going to do.","Victor L. Campbell","So you did throw the curveball, it came to me. We're all reading the same press. We obviously have folks in both places. I think, clearly, if you look at Florida and Texas, it's probably greater odds for something to happen in Florida, but it's getting down to the wire and they've got, I guess, until the end of the week for this session to end. And so again, it's a moving part and I don't want to place any bets one way or the other there. Clearly, we're supportive, we would like to see it go in that direction. But we'll just see that play out. There's always the opportunity for a special session. Whether or not that would happen or not, again, is anyone's best guess. Texas is probably a little -- maybe a little more political at this point. There are folks down there that would like to see it move forward. You also have a situation where that session, they meet every other year, so if they don't get something done here pretty quick, we're not going to likely see a special session until the year after next. So I'd say, coin tosses, maybe a 2-headed coin in 1 state. And with that, I want to thank everybody for your participation. I know Mark is excited to take all your calls this afternoon, and I will be here as well. Thank you for participating.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead sir.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you Stephanie, and good morning to everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I'd like to welcome everyone on today's call, including those of you that are listening on the webcast. Here this morning with me is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release, and in our various SEC filings.","Several other factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements.","The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's first quarter earnings release that came out this morning.","This call is being recorded. A replay is available later today. With that I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining the call and the webcast. This morning we issued our first quarter 2016 earnings release, highlighting the financial operational performance of the company. I'll make a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the quarter's results.","We are pleased with the results in the first quarter which are in line with our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.003 billion for the first quarter, increased 2.1% over prior year. As expected, the first quarter of this year was a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2015 when adjusted EBITDA grew 19.3% over the first quarter of 2014.","Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., increased 17.3%, and earnings per share increased 24.3% for the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, net income, EPS and cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by an accounting change we adopted related to share-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the quarter.","Our 2016 guidance remains unchanged, except for adjusted EPS which has been increased by $0.20 per diluted share on both the low and the high end of the range. This is to reflect the tax benefit recorded during the first quarter of 2016 related to the accounting change made in this first quarter. We have not attempted to estimate the impact of this accounting change on future quarters of 2016, as the tax benefit depends upon the number of equity awards settled each period, and the market value of our stock at the time of settlement.","We continue to experience solid growth in inpatient and outpatient volumes as well as surgical and emergency room visits. We believe these results speak the quality of our markets, and the execution of our strategic agenda.","Same facility admissions increased 1.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Our growth drivers include capital improvements, programmatic developments within our service lines, end market access point development and strategic acquisitions.","This year we plan to invest $2.7 billion to expand our service capabilities and capacity in our markets. In 2016, approximately 350 new inpatient beds and 100 new ER beds will come online, with another 550 inpatient beds and 200 ER beds scheduled for completion in 2017. We continue to see solid growth from our investments into service line development such as trauma, cardiology, rehab and (4:58) services. Our strategy to expand our access points in our markets is providing growth opportunities to inpatient and outpatient services. The effective execution of our growth agenda is yielding market share gains, and Sam will provide additional details in a moment.","With respect to supply expense we continue to see solid execution of our initiatives to manage our supply costs. We are pleased with the early results of our integration of Tenet Healthcare into HealthTrust Purchasing Group. And clearly, one of the highlights of the quarter is the strong growth in cash flows from operations, up 37.4% over last year's first quarter. The quarter reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation. During the quarter we generated almost $1.4 billion in cash flows from operations, and we deployed $509 million to capital expenditures, and $621 million to repurchase 8.921 million shares of our stock. And we had $1.983 billion remaining on our $3 billion share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.","Finally, let me recognize Don Stinnett, HCA's, Senior Vice President and Controller who retired at the end of April. We thank Don for his 17 years of service, and the many contributions he's made to our company. I'd also like to welcome Chris Wyatt who has succeeded Don as Senior Vice President and Controller. Chris most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HCA Information Technology and Services organization.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven by good volume growth and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter.","As we reported, in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by (7:08)","During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.1% on a same facility basis, and now represent 33% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the quarter, in line with our recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.6% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 9.4%. These represent 6.9% of our total admissions compared to 6.3% last year.","There are a couple of points on our uninsured volume I'd like to call out. First, our uninsured same facility admissions in our expansion states were flat year-over-year, while our non-expansion states grew just over 11%. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions, and represent 90% of the year-over-year growth. And to put this uninsured growth into perspective, the 10.6% growth we saw in the quarter equates to just over 3,000 admissions for the company, compared to the 477,000 same facility admissions we have for the quarter.","Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 1.5%, and equivalent admissions increased 2.7% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 6.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the first quarter for both 2016 and 2015.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.7% compared to the prior-year period. Same facility surgeries increased 3.3% in the quarter, with inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4%, and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.4% from the prior year.","Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in the quarter. Our outpatient revenues in the first quarter continued to show very strong growth. Outpatient revenues in the quarter represented 38.9% of total revenues, up 120 basis points from prior year's first quarter.","Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.9% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $618 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $951 million in the quarter, an increase of $63 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.076 billion, an increase of $555 million over the prior-year period.","Now turning to expenses. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue was 45.8%, compared to 45.5% in last year's first quarter, and 45.7% for the full year of 2015. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the quarter on a same facility basis. Productivity, as measured by same facility man-hours per adjusted admission, improved 0.5%, and same facility wage rates increased 2.5% in the quarter.","Supply expense as a percent of revenues, were 16.7% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in last year's first quarter, on a consolidated basis. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased from 1.4% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives.","Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.1% of revenues, and was consistent with the 18% we ran in Q4 of 2015, and 18.2% in Q3 of 2015. We recognized $4 million of electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $19 million last year, consistent with our expectations.","Let me briefly touch on cash flow. As Milton mentioned, we had another extremely strong quarter, with cash flow from operations just under $1.4 billion, about a $380 million improvement. Cash flow from operations was benefited by $74 million due to the adoption of new accounting standard that I will discuss in a minute. Free cash flow increased $339 million, from $440 million in Q1 of 2015 to $779 million in Q1 of 2016.","At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at March 31, 2016 compared to 3.85 times at the end of 2015.","Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 12,500 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 9,860 we saw in the first quarter of last year, or about a 27% increase. You may recall, we saw about 11,200 same facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2015, or 11% increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter. We believe this is largely due to the minimum enrollment (13:27)","For perspective, exchange admissions represent about 2.6% of total admissions for the company. We saw approximately 50,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximate 37,000 visits in the first quarter of 2015 and 38,000 visits in the fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, our exchange and reform activity is in line with our expectations.","Lastly, as mentioned in the release, the company did elect to early adopt a new accounting standard FASB ASU 2016-09, which was issued in late March. This standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. In summary, the standard requires the excess tax benefits related to equity award settlements will be recorded as a component to the provision for income taxes prospectively, versus previously these amounts were recorded directly at equity. In the quarter, we recorded $74 million tax benefit, or $0.18 per diluted share related to this adoption. Also, these tax benefit amounts were previously presented as cash flow from financing activities, but are now reflected as cash flows from operating activities.","So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continued to show broad-based growth across our markets, and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. There were a number of factors that impacted our inpatient admissions and outpatient volumes this quarter.","First, flu admissions were down by 40%, which affected our overall inpatient admission growth rate by 0.6%. And then secondly, leap year positively affected our inpatient admissions by approximately 1%. But this calendar effect was partially offset by the Easter holidays which were in March this year. We believe the net impact of all these factors had an immaterial effect on overall volumes.","For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 14 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, and 13 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. The company had a total of 56 freestanding emergency rooms at the end of March. We had 44 last year at this time. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 31% and accounted for approximately one-third of our overall growth in visits. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 5%. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of provider networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects.","In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facility base and service line was equally strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.8%, which increased surgical admits to 27.6% of total admits in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories.","Outpatient surgeries grew by 4.6%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division had equally strong growth. Also same facility outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures grew by 1.6%.","The company continues, strategically, to add freestanding ambulatory, endoscopic and pain centers to its provider networks. As compared to the first quarter of last year, we have acquired or developed nine new centers, and closed or sold four for a net of five more, bringing our total to 131 centers. Including these new centers, the company's total outpatient surgery volumes grew 6.3% and outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures were up 6.7%.","Behavioral health admissions grew 2.7%, rehab admissions grew 2.8%. Deliveries were flat in the quarter, however, managed deliveries were up 4.4%. Neonatal admissions grew 4.7%, but our length of stay declined because of less acuity this quarter, which impacted our patient day growth in this service line.","Overall, average length of stay increased 0.5%, which was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase.","Other volume statistics for the quarter are as follows. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 5%, trauma volumes grew 27%, observation visits were up 13%, and finally the company's urgent care visits in total grew 22%. The company had 68 urgent care centers at the end of March this year, up from 50 last year.","The inpatient market share data for the 12 months ended September 2015 shows that HCA continued to gain share, and our composite share of 24.6% was at its highest level in the past five years. We believe our comprehensive growth agenda, which is both well-resourced and well executed, provides further opportunities for the company to increase market share and drive revenue growth.","With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Sam. Stephanie, if you will come back on and poll for questions, and we would encourage folks to ask only one question, so we can get everybody covered.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will go first to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","(20:07) So in this quarter, and in previous quarters that you've experienced increases in uninsured volumes, some folks have been focusing on bad debt, and so while I hate to ask the question, I have to ask the question because I know it's on the minds of many. So the fundamental question is, how worried should we be about the increment that we see in your bad debt ratio in this quarter? That's number one.","Number two, can you give us an estimate of the impact of the treatment of these patients on the EBITDA performance? And whether that might be a reflection of the difference between this year's in line performance versus last year's strong outperformance?","And third, can you give us a sense of whether or not that increase that you experienced was anticipated by you, or whether you're gaining market share and adding ERs may have led to a slightly higher than anticipated increase in uninsured services?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sheryl, thank you. Bill do you want to take that?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Sheryl, good morning. Let me try to address most of your points. When I look at the bad debts, and as you know, for HCA, I think we have to look at the total uncompensated care picture, which includes charity as well as the uninsured discounts. When I look at our total uncompensated care trends, those trends are pretty consistent with our recent experience. When I look at it as a percent of adjusted revenue, it was 32% for the quarter, 32.6% in the fourth quarter, 33% a little high in the third quarter, 30.7% in the first and 29.6% in the first. (22:00) So our trends are pretty consistent, and I would tell you we're pretty much in line with what we had internally projected.","As we've said, I believe the uninsured volume will be driven by our emergency room volume. Our emergency room uninsured ED visits were up 26,000 compared to our 3,000 or so uninsured growth, you see that's a 12% in net rate, which is pretty consistent with what we've historically seen.","And then as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by Florida and Texas. Obviously two non-expansion states that we continue to see. So I had anticipated our uninsured trends to kind of settle out around that high single digit level. I think it will be really settling where our ED visits land.","The EBITDA impact is really marginal. As we talked, the EBITDA impact is the marginal cost that we have for that, so I don't think that really contributed materially to the EBITDA issues for the quarter for the company.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, did you have anything? All right. Sheryl, thank you.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We go now to A.J. Rice with UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. I might just ask one technical question and then a broader question. Just on the technical one, you were very active in the buybacks in the quarter. What should we think of in terms of ongoing buybacks? And is there any update on what you did so far? But my broader question is with the consolidation for the managed care guys pending, and with a lot of discussion about various incentive payments on part of managed care guys with providers, either positive incentives or putting price at risk. Are you seeing any change in contracting behavior as you look out over the next year or two? And what percentage of your contracts are sort of locked up? And any color on what you're seeing there?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Milton, do you want to take number one? And maybe Sam on two?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, as I mentioned in my comments, at the end of the quarter, we had just under $2 billion remaining on our share repurchase, $1.983 billion. But I'm going to give you an update, through yesterday, at close of market activity, our remaining authorization is $1.708 billion, so just over $1.7 billion remaining. So we have been active since the end of the quarter. Obviously, we'll go into an open period here shortly \u2013 by tomorrow, and so we're evaluating our purchasing patterns as we go through the next several weeks. But we have remained active in the market since the end of the first quarter, A.J.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam or, Bill. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","On the managed care front, I think the general comment is this. The pricing environment is generally consistent across most of our markets with what we've seen over the past 24 months to 36 months. There are some nuances from one market to the other, with one contractor or the other, where we have to adjust the structural pieces of the contract, but again, those are more on the fringe than in the core aspects of the contract.","For the company, we're largely contracted for all of 2016, as we indicated in our guidance. We're about 70% contracted in 2017, and about 45% contracted for 2018. And in general, the pricing escalation and the structural aspects of those contracts are pretty much consistent with what we've seen in the past 24 months or 36 months. We don't believe that the consolidation across our 42 markets of the payers is going to have a global impact on HCA.","We think, if those particular mergers are consummated, that in some market, they could have some nuanced impact, but again, we don't see that as a material change in what's going on in the marketplace.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Wanted to concentrate on the divergence in growth rates on your surgeries, inpatient versus outpatient. I'm trying to figure out how much of that is patient preference or physician movement, relative to how much of that is HCA initiatives around growth in your surgery centers, and your specific initiatives to do that? I guess, trying to figure out how much of that is intentional, versus how much of that is just market driven?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Sam, you want...","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Well, we have a very robust surgical growth initiative in general across the company, and we call it our OR of choice initiatives, where we are very sensitive to physician issues, patient issues, scheduling issues and so forth. We've been very aggressive with our equipment investment, and that has application across both the inpatient and outpatient. On the inpatient side, the inpatient surgeries tend to be more connected to our approach in driving more complex care: trauma care, burn care, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and neurosciences.","And so those are a little slower moving, I would say, in general, although our inpatient surgery growth has been very steady over the last three-and-a-half years, where we've seen pretty consistent growth, I'm counting up the quarters as I look here, almost 11 straight quarters of inpatient surgical growth across HCA.","On the outpatient side, we again are seeing demand growth in outpatient surgery, and we try to create two venues for patients and physicians to operate. One being freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, where again, we've added to our portfolio over the past few years, and we have efforts to grow those particular centers. And then within our hospitals, where we have physicians who like to do inpatient cases, they also tend to want to do their outpatient cases on the same days, and so we're trying to accommodate them as well. But in total, our outpatient surgeries have grown very consistently over the same 12 quarters, 13 quarters, with a little bit of acceleration in this first quarter. And I can't really point to why it accelerated in the first quarter as compared to the trend. But our efforts are broad-based. We have a number of initiatives, including capital investments, that are intended to drive surgical activity across the three areas of our business: inpatient, ambulatory surgery and then hospital-based outpatient.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Josh, thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. You talked about labor productivity, but I didn't hear any mention of contract labor. Could you tell us kind of how contract labor trends ran relative to a year ago in recent quarters? And then also could you provide a comment on the recent Florida legislation on balance billing and out-of-network? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, you are up again.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","For labor, we were pleased with the results for labor in the first quarter, and we were pleased in particular when you look at it sequentially against the fourth quarter of 2015 where we had 3.5% productivity improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, which represents about a 75% flex rate, if you want to call it that, on the incremental volume that we saw from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.","Now, in the first quarter we have to pay more payroll taxes, more unemployment insureds and so forth, so our total spend was up about $122 million because of benefit costs, natural growth that occurs first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","Compared to last year we did have a slight margin erosion. Two factors drove that. Share-based comp being a piece of that, and then a moderated growth in contract labor being the other piece. Contract labor for the company has run the same amount of dollars over the last three quarters now. So the first quarter did not see any growth in total spend compared to the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the third quarter, so we've seen some stabilization.","We believe that our efforts around this particular area presents an opportunity for HCA in the future. If we can stem some of the nursing turnover that we have experienced and improve our retention efforts, and we have a number of initiatives to deal with that, we think we can drive some incremental improvements over time in this particular area. So all in all, the productivity and the results from a labor standpoint for HCA in the quarter were well managed, we believe, when you look at it compared to where we were in the fourth quarter.","With respect to the balance billing issue in Florida, we're not thinking that's going to create a lot of issues for us one way or the other. We believe for our patients it's going to be beneficial and that it will eliminate in many instances potential surprise billings around certain hospital-based physician providers. But for us and our approach to the market and our relationships with our physician contract companies, we're not anticipating any kind of impact from the balance billing legislation in Florida.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Frank, thank you.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I feel like you guys have a lot underway behind-the-scenes with HPG and I sense that there's some momentum in some areas like pharmacy and distribution centers, and how you're aligning the pharmacists with the supply chain decisions. Just any comments around these initiatives would be helpful.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take that one (32:22) And you're right, we have a lot of momentum inside the HealthTrust Purchasing Group, not only with activities with our members, as Milton said with the Tenet integrations and some others that they are very integrated with us from an operational standpoint and have been for over 10 years from managing our distribution centers, accounts payable, and we have some recent initiatives there that we still become very encouraged with.","One of them is what we refer to as a pharmacy consolidation initiative that we have going on throughout the markets in HCA where we consolidate the pharmacy supply chain as well as the pharmacy distribution chain, and embed pharmacists in there to work with our clinicians on the floor to ensure that the prescriptions in our pharmacy utilization is optimized on there.","In addition, it helps us with the procurement of pharmacy and looking at the storage and inventory on there. So it's just one more initiative that we have going on. They're embedded in our operating rooms to help us manage our inventories, supply chain within the operating rooms as well as many other distribution efforts. So the overall HPG from one aggregated spend on the GPO as well as operational initiatives, I think continue to deliver a lot of value to HCA and its members.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Milt, do you want to add something?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll just add with respect to HPG. I mean, it continues to grow. We're very pleased with the growth in terms of purchasing power. Being a GPO (33:54) a major piece of the leverage is purchasing power. I think for 2016 HPG will probably hit somewhere in the $27 billion to $28 billion range in terms of purchasing power across all of the membership, and again, that's a committed compliance model, and I think that will allow us to continue not only focus on improving operational results with better supply chain management, but also continue to achieve a better pricing from vendors as a result of being able to do (34:20) market share to them.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks (34:24)","Operator","We'll go now to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Question on the psych and the rehab volumes. The numbers were, I guess, pretty solid numbers but really sharply down over where they'd been the last few years. Just wanted to see if there was anything going on there as far as how you were spending your capital. And I guess thoughts about the IMD exclusion, whether that makes you think differently about how you pursue psych volumes, whether you'd want to outsource that or actually build freestanding sites to take advantage of that.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","In total, behavioral health admissions were off the trend at 2.7%. They've been trending in the upper single digits. I think for the most part, we had three facilities out of our 58 facilities that were down significantly. And when you looked at the other 55 facilities, they were actually on trend. So we had a challenge or two at two facilities, three facilities rather, that created the composite problem for the company. There is no change in our strategy. We continue to invest in behavioral health capacity, and we have a lot of demand for that. We've recently approved some expansion of behavioral health capabilities in a number of markets to deal with that.","In some instances, we have struggled with psychiatrists in the supply physician coverage, and that's been more the barrier to growth than actual capacity. But behavioral health continues to be a very important component and service line for our market strategy as well as a complement to our emergency room service line strategy.","On the rehab side, again, we did see a little bit of volume growth that was off trend. Rehab was more in the upper single digits as well. Again, no significant change across the company with respect to capital investment or focus on that particular service line. It was unusually soft in the first quarter. Again, a couple of hospitals explain some of that. We have seen in a few markets where we've some bundled pilots that it's had a marginal impact. But all in all, that continues to be a very strong service line. We have investments going forward into that particular service line where we're adding capacity. And again, it complements very important service lines for HCA like neurosciences, trauma and burn and service lines like that. So we see opportunities for growth in that one as well.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Well, if anybody want to address the IMD exclusion. Bill?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We don't think it's going to have any material impact on HCA. The majority of our behavioral health is still sourced from our emergency rooms. So again, I think as Sam said, I don't think that changes our strategy at all going forward.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks Kevin.","Operator","We'll go now to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I just want to talk a little bit more about the other operating expense line. It was certainly higher than we expected. I appreciate that it was roughly consistent with second half 2015 numbers, but it certainly was up 40 basis points year-over-year. And historically, it's usually stepped down or been flat year-over-year. It actually stepped up sequentially rather. What was behind that increase? And based on your comments around 2H, should be thinking of 18.1% really as the new run rate, or was there something particularly high in the quarter? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Well, let me say that other operating expenses, generally, stay about the same from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. We did see a little bit of a trend change last year where it actually trended down a bit in the first quarter. But in general, when I look back over three years, four years, it stayed about the same and that's what we saw this year. The fourth quarter and the first quarter were almost identical. But when you look at it compared to the first quarter of last year, the execution of our service line initiatives, primarily trauma and then secondarily, graduate medical education, is driving professional fee expense growth for the company.","We saw some deterioration in margin, primarily because of professional fee expense. And there were three things that drove that. First, we did an acquisition of a physician network in Northern California last year, where most of the costs of that particular acquisition are in other expenses. And that drove a piece of the margin erosion.","The second piece and probably the more important piece and more connected to the company's strategy is around trauma program development, where we have to invest in professional fees to support our trauma programs. And again, we've added significant amount of trauma programs, some are in their early stage startup modes, so you see a little bit of a disproportionate load of other operating expenses as a result. And then the third piece was in our graduate medical education programs, where we've added graduate medical education programs for residents and so forth at a number of our facilities which required some level of professional fees for faculties and such so that we can support those programs.","All in all, we think there will be some growth in these numbers over the remaining portion of the year, but not in any way where it changes our trend and our expectation on the margin levels that Bill laid out. If you look at some of our components, like our ER physician call per ER visit, or ER call pay-per-ER-visit, those are generally in line with what we expected, slightly up, again, because of these program changes. So that's the biggest driver of our other expenses on a year-over-year, but it's very consistent, like Bill said, with the fourth quarter and even the third quarter, so the run rate is really not that materially changed.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Andy, thanks. Thanks Sam.","Operator","We'll go now to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I had a question just on the exchange volumes, and recognizing that it's still a small piece of the overall business. Just interested if, in terms of the year-over-year, and even in terms of some of the sequential volume increases, whether you've observed any type of rising case mix or acuity on those types of admissions from the exchange patients?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Scott, thanks. Actually on our exchange business is staying really consistent, if you look at the mix, the case mix index, or the acuity of what we were running in 2015, and for that matter even in 2014. So as you know, we look at a variety of characteristics of that change volume, source of admission, surgical medical mix, and it's staying relatively consistent in 2016, is the best way to describe that. As I said in my comments, we are seeing growth \u2013 continued growth in reform, and I think that's largely attributable to the new enrollment that we saw this year starting in January, and so, with any hope, continue to see that growing going forward. But in terms of the mix of the exchange volume and the characteristics, very comparable in 2016 compared to what it was in 2015.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","We'll go now to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Sam, you talked about the freestanding EDs as driving 30%-plus of the growth in the ER space, so do you mind just sharing with us what your growth plans are for that side of your business? And then, what do you see in terms of acuity levels in freestanding EDs, and are we seeing a change in how people use ERs in the markets where you're opening these facilities?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Like I said, we have 56 freestanding emergency rooms today, that's up from 44 last year at this time. I think next year at this time, we will probably be somewhere between \u2013 depending on how quickly we get these up \u2013 10 to 12 freestanding emergency rooms more as well. So our pipeline on development of these freestanding emergency rooms is still fairly strong. We should be somewhere around 70 freestanding emergency rooms, I think, in the next 12 months to 18 months. The acuity level tends to be a bit lower than what you see in a hospital-based emergency room, for a couple of reasons.","One, obviously trauma cases aren't going to a freestanding emergency room, certain chest pain events are not going to a freestanding emergency room, nor are stroke events. So you have a natural tendency for the more acute patients, which are delivered by ambulance, to go to a hospital base because it's highly likely that they will be admitted. I think the freestanding emergency room plays a very important part in our network development; it plays a very important part in our outreach to consumers, to make it easy for them to access the system.","I don't know that the ER as a venue, if you will, is changing in any significant way. I do believe, though, that urgent care and emergency rooms over the past three years to five years, and I think this will be the case going forward, is still a substitute for the shortages of primary care physicians that exist in a lot of markets. And so you see urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms, and even hospital-based emergency rooms, providing the solution that patients are looking for when they can't get into a physician clinic because of physician shortages, or because of payer dynamics. So from that standpoint, that probably structurally stays in place and we think it's part, in part \u2013 part of the reason for the overall demand growth that we've seen over the past few years in emergency room visit volume, and we think that will continue in the near-term.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Sam.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Brian, thank you. Stephanie, we've got time for probably two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry if this is already something you can calculate from the numbers you provided, but can you back out the \u2013 give us the managed care admissions and adjusted admissions excluding the exchange lives? And I'm not saying that that's the right way to look at it, I'm just wondering if you have that that you can share with us.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Bill, I don't know whether you have that or not?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We can give that. I'll qualify that a large portion of our exchange business is coming from previously insured, so it's skewed, and that's why we include the exchanges in that number. It looks like on our managed and other, if you exclude exchange is up about 1% on adjusted admissions.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, instead of 2.7%. Yeah, okay.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, so let me ask you, based on what you've seen, is it your conjecture that there has been substantial growth in the exchange enrollment from the previously uninsured, or does it look more or like mix shift? And I know you can't give an exact answer, I'm just curious if you have an off-the-cuff?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's probably more mix. I would not say that we're seeing substantial changes in the exchanges coming from previously insured. As we reported last year, historically in the exchanges in the first couple of years about 40% of that exchange volume is newly insured and 60% was coming from previously insured. My sense is those trends are staying relatively the same, so I really don't see there's dramatic shifts in that aspect of that that obviously would be in year three. The current year exchange volume was also probably an exchange patient last year, too. So that's changing a little bit. But I would say that growth is just more continued market share and mix shift changes that we're seeing.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Matt. One more question, Stephanie.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. Just on the operating cash flow, I think you previously said you expected around $5 billion. Given the quarterly results, do you see that going higher? And then just on the CapEx, when we look at $2.7 billion, can you give us a sense for how much of that is going towards just real basic maintenance CapEx versus growth things like the freestanding ERs? Thanks a lot.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, guys?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, I'll start. So right now, I think about $5 billion of cash flow from operations we're still \u2013 that's what we're projecting right now. There are some quarter-by-quarter fluctuations that may occur, but right now, we still think that's a good plane number.","On our capital deployment of $2.7 billion, we said there's about $250 million of that of IT, roughly 40% or so are routine, and then 50% to 60% in terms of growth capital deployment. And as Milt said in his comments, that's spread among program development, access points and building new capacity. So when you take IT and routine, it's roughly 45% or so of our total capital, and the balance being growth capital deployment.","Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, and let me add \u2013 this is Sam. Let me add one thing to what Bill just said. I think HCA has a very diversified capital allocation strategy in general, but specifically to our capital expenditure allocation strategy, it too is diversified across markets, across service lines and across different kinds of facility base, and that creates a very conservative confident level of allocation for the company, in my opinion.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Chris, thank you very much.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","And I think with that, we'll call it a day. Mark is here, so we look forward to seeing some of you at the conferences that are coming up, and you all have a good day.","Operator","This concludes our conference.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Shannon. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I'd like to welcome everyone to the call today, also welcome all of you that are listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer.","Before I turn the call over to Milt, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.

In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the second quarter earnings release.","This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast today. I'll make a few comments on the quarter, and our updated guidance, and our recent M&A activity, and then I'll ask Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the second quarter results.","Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2017. Although, we are on plan for the second quarter, it's slightly off from our internal plan for adjusted EBITDA at midyear. Our results in the first half have been challenged by, one, softer managed and exchange volumes, and, two, our London market results have been negatively impacted by currency conversion rates and lower admissions from Middle East embassies and private insurance. Sam will provide additional detail on the London market later on the call.","Our operating and corporate teams have executed well in managing expenses in the first half of this year. We continue to invest in our key strategic initiatives that will contribute to improving future clinical, operational, and financial performance. As Bill will highlight in a moment, our balance sheet and cash flow gives us the financial flexibility to invest in our existing markets to acquire new hospitals and to continue to execute our share repurchase plan. I will provide an update on recent acquisition activities later in my comments, but we are pleased to be able to expand our networks across several markets.","Now turning to the second quarter, revenues for the second quarter increased 4% to $10.7 billion. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare totaled $657 million or $1.75 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of total $2.09 billion, in line with our expectations. As noted in our release, the tax benefit from equity award settlements was $9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to last year's tax benefit of $44 million or $0.11 per diluted share.","Volume growth trend remains materially consistent with recent trends, with same-facility admissions increasing 0.8% and equivalent admissions increasing 1.3% over the prior year. This represents the 13th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA. On payer mix, for domestic operations are same-facility Medicare admissions comprise 46.8% of the company's overall admissions, while our same-facility managed care and exchange admissions were 27.7% of total domestic admissions compared to the 46.3% and 28.3% respectively in the prior year's second quarter.","Based upon our results through six months of the year, we have updated and narrowed our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share for 2017. We currently estimate that adjusted EBITDA will now range from $8.35 billion to $8.5 billion and earnings per share will now range from $7.00 to $7.30 per diluted share for the year. Part of the EPS change is due to reducing the estimated tax benefit from recording of employee equity award settlements from our original estimate of $0.40 per diluted share for the year to our updated $0.27.","Cash flow from operations remained strong for the company in the quarter, totaling $1.404 billion, compared to $1.349 billion in last year's second quarter. Our days in AR improved to 49 days compared to 50 days at year end 2016.","We have remained active with share repurchase in the quarter. We repurchased 6.4 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $542 million. Year to date, the company repurchased 11.5 shares at a cost of $966 million, and at June 30, 2017, we had $887 million remaining under the existing repurchase authorization.","Now, let me provide an update on the recent acquisition activities. On July 10, we announced an agreement to acquire Weatherford Regional Medical Center, a 103-bed hospital about 30 miles west of Fort Worth, and acquired it from Community Health Systems. Weatherford Regional will join our 13 hospitals and 7,000 active physicians in our HCA Medical City Healthcare network. We would expect this transaction to close during the fall of this year.","Effective July 1, 2017, we completed the transaction to acquire two Texas hospitals from Community Health, and we expect to close on the previously announced Tenet Houston Hospitals by the end of this month. We continue to be on track to close the previously announced Memorial Health System in Savannah, Georgia by year end. And lastly, on July 21, we announced an agreement to acquire Highlands Regional Medical Center, a 126-bed acute care hospital in Sebring, Florida, from Community Health Systems.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and our health reform trends in the second quarter. As we reported in the second quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 0.8% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of the volume in a moment, and I'll give you some trends by payer class.","During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 5.1% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior-year period and represent 34.5% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, in the quarter compared to the prior-year period, fairly consistent with the recent trends. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 4.9% in the quarter. This represents 7.8% of our total admissions compared to 7.5% in the second quarter of last year.","Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.3%, while equivalent admissions were flat on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.5% of our total ER visits in the quarter, consistent with the second quarter of last year.","Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 3.2% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries were flat to prior year and outpatient surgeries declined 1.2% from the previous year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2% over the prior year for the quarter.","And as Milton indicated, international operations adversely affected our results. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations increased 2.6% over the prior year for the quarter. Our same-facility managed care other and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $422 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care totaled $1.172 billion in the quarter, an increase of $74 million, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.463 billion, an increase of $348 million over the prior year period.","Now turning to expenses, our expense management remained strong in the quarter. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.7% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it increased 60 basis points from 18.9% in the first quarter of this year.","Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% compared to the last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for the second quarter compared to the prior year.","We did see a growth in medical device spend similar to what we saw in the first quarter due to volume growth for some high acuity procedures. Supply expense as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points sequentially from the first quarter. Other operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.3% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year contract services and professional fees that we discussed on our first quarter call.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.404 billion. Year to date, cash flows from operations were $2.684 billion and free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests, was $1.132 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $3.8 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. This is higher than we typically carry in anticipation of closing three facility acquisitions in Houston on July 31.","We did complete several financing transactions during the quarter, including extending and increasing our revolver capacity and closing on a $1.5 billion, 5.5% senior secured note with a 30-year term, which we plan to use for acquisitions, and we redeemed some 2018 near-term maturities. This was an important transaction for the company as it represents the first time in 14 years that we've issued a bond with a term greater than 10 years. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.83 times at June 30, 2017, compared to 3.82 times at December 31 of 2016. Our strong cash flow, balance sheet position and EPS growth continue to highlight an important strength of the company.","Let me speak briefly on our health reform activity. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 12,800 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 13,400 we saw in the second quarter of last year for a decline of 4.2% year-over-year. But it did reflect a 7.5% growth sequentially from the first quarter. We saw approximately 52,400 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to the 54,800 in the second quarter of 2016 and 49,800 in the first quarter of 2017, or a 5.3% growth sequential. So overall, these reform trends are tracking with the enrollment activity in our markets and generally in line with our expectations.","So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Good morning. Let me provide some more detail on our volume trends for the quarter. On a same-facility basis for our domestic operations as compared to the second quarter last year, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was particularly strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, and Continental divisions. And conversely, our Houston and South Florida divisions were weak. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions.","Six of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 13%, while hospital-based emergency visits declined 0.9%. Once again, most of this decline was seen in lower acuity visits. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 1.2%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 13% and 1.4% respectively. Inpatient surgeries grew 0.6%. Surgical admissions were 30% of total admissions in the quarter, which is essentially flat with prior year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and neuroscience service lines. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were down 0.9%. Volumes were down in both our hospital base and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Seven of 14 divisions were up in this service line. Behavioral health admissions grew 2.6%. Rehab admissions grew 7%. Cardiology volumes grew 7.4%. Births were down 3.1% and neonatal admissions were essentially flat.","In summary, our volumes were generally consistent with the first quarter. As Bill referenced, we did see a slight improvement in our managed care and exchange volumes this quarter, with adjusted admissions in these payer classes flat year-over-year. As I stated in my comments last quarter, we believe commercial demand has been soft over the last four or five quarters, which we believe explains most of our softer volumes. On a positive note, we have seen our commercial market share rebound some in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 on a sequential basis.","Now let me transition to our operations in London. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for this market was down 30% in local currency and 35% in dollars, or approximately $25 million. This decline depressed the company's adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. The second quarter was particularly weak because of a significant decline in admissions, which were down 7.4%, and surgeries, which were down by 11.3%. There were two factors that drove this weakness. First, admissions from the Middle East, which is an important part of our business, were down 33% in the quarter. This business has been trending down over the past year, but was down even more in the quarter. Additionally, admissions in our medical insurance segment were down 10%. These declines were partially offset by our private pay admissions, which grew by 13%. We believe our team is making the appropriate adjustments to our growth strategy and cost structure to respond to these trends. Operating margins in this market were still strong, and we believe London is a good market for the company.","Overall, we continue to refine and enhance our efforts to improve our business and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace, and ultimately sustain growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Sam, thank you. Shannon, if you could come back on and we'd like to start the question and answer process and I'd encourage each of you who ask question, limit it to one so we can give everyone an opportunity.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. We first move to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just first on the guidance, perhaps this is an overly simplistic view, but historically HCA has earned around 25% of their full-year EBITDA in the second quarter, which implies a run rate that's slightly below $8.4 billion for the full year. So, what areas of improvement are you seeing that gives you confidence that the underlying trends improve in the second half of the year?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Milton, Bill, how do you want to take that?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I'll take a shot, and then Bill can come in. Whit, as you think about our projections for the rest of the year, so let's talk about the first half and how we think that relates to our expectations in the second half. So as I said in my comments, and Bill mentioned, we're on our plan for the second quarter, so the $2.09 billion that we reported in adjusted EBITDA is on plan with our second quarter. We were about, for the mid-year, about 1% off of where we thought our plan would be.","And so as we look at the second half, our comps do get easier. As we think about the volume comps and some of the revenue comps, they do ease in the second half. We think that we can continue to see solid expectations around 4% or so on revenue growth. And that if we hit our targets, we think we can come in pretty much, I think, around the middle of the range that we stated, our revised range. So, we have confidence in that. Obviously, our expense management, we've taken some action there. We think those will continue to yield benefits in the second half of the year. Again, as I've said in my comments, I'm very pleased with our expense management in the first half, but we have made some adjustments going into the second half, and I think that will help us as well.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","And Whit, this is Bill. The only thing I'd add, we did some change in the currency conversion of our London operations in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year as that begins to sunset itself. So that's an improving trend as well.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Whit.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. I guess if you could do a little more color on \u2013 because I guess the guidance, you're reaffirming the revenue target, but you're taking down the EBITDA target. Can you just give a little bit more color about what exactly the pressure is versus the original guidance as far as cost, or there's something around payer mix that's causing that to come down?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill, you?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, I kind of look at it \u2013 we lowered the \u2013 lowering of our EBITDA range by $50 million. It's a relatively smaller amount. The revenue range, we're on plan with our revenue, as Milton said here today. So, we feel comfortable to come still within that range. So there's nothing other specific that I would call out.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, so what we're doing with our guidance is obviously we tightened it on the high end. The implied growth rate that we would have to have to achieve the high end of range is probably close to 10% second half of the year. So we took that off the table and tried to \u2013 and as we usually do mid-year, we tightened our range. And so as Bill said, we did drop the low end by $50 million. We think that's reflective of our first half performance, where as I said, we're off our plan by about 1%. And so that's reflective, really, of that expectation. But if we can perform on our plan for the second half of the year like we have here in the second quarter, then we should be well within our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA that we stated this morning.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","Next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Just can I get a quick numbers question first? In your updated guidance, does it include the deals that have already closed, like Tenet, or it includes no deals whatsoever closed in it?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Justin, this is Bill. It doesn't include any acquisitions completed to date. We typically wouldn't include acquisitions that are not yet completed. The ones we've completed to date are relatively smaller revenue, roughly $150 million to $170 million. So we've got room within our revenue range for that, but just in case the guidance claims from how we originally presented it, it doesn't include any acquisitions, and there's really nominal, if any, EBITDA impact of acquisitions.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","And we're looking, obviously, for some revenue contribution in the second half, but immaterial EBITDA.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Correct.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then...","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Justin, did you...","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. The question was just around, Sam, you went through some of those market share numbers pretty quick. I heard you say that commercial actually is starting to stabilize\/improve. But can you give us some more color there, especially around or including the $4 billion that you talked about of in-flight capital and how you see that trending for the back half of the year, in your mind? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Sam, you?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","So, let me give you an overview on our market share for 2016, which is the last period that we have. Overall, our market share is modestly down, like down 8 basis points. Last year it was roughly 25%. It's about 24.92% or so, thereabout. So it's modestly down. The market as a whole, all of HCA's markets grew by roughly 2% with a slight tilt down in the last half of the year, just slightly below the 2%.","On the commercial side, the commercial demand in HCA's markets grew by 1% in 2016. Again, a little bit tilted more toward the first half of last year, but still growing even in the second half of last year, and that's where we started to see some rebound both really in overall share and commercial share. So if you look at our market share, and I like to look at it on a sequential basis because it tells me more timely what's happening in the marketplace, is we've started to see both our overall share rebound, to the point where we're 25.07% in the fourth quarter, so we're actually starting to see some recovery. And then we're up a little bit also on our commercial at 22.1%, so we're seeing a recovery sequentially in our market share.","We do have a couple of pockets of markets where we have some pressures. I highlighted some of those in our comments. But overall, I think we're seeing a stabilization and a slight rebound in our market share positioning across the company.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Justin.","Operator","Next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Can you give us more color on the managed and exchange volumes? Was it more on the exchange side or the non-exchange market? And to what degree do you view these as short-term factors impacting admissions versus more of a thematic or a long-term pressure?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I'll start with the exchange volumes. So as we mentioned, we're down about 4% on a year-over-year basis. And that tracks by all data that we have with the enrollments in our marketplace. And it's sequentially up 7%. And so that did have an impact in terms of the overall managed and other books. Over the past couple of years, as you know, we've been seeing exchange volume growth, especially in the first half of the year as it tends to ramp coming out of the first and second quarter, where we're seeing 15% to 20% growth in exchange. This year we're seeing a slight decline. Realize exchanges are less than 3% of our total, but that change in growth trends did impact the overall managed care book, but to a relatively smaller amount.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, and let me just add to that, Bill. This is Sam. I think last quarter we indicated that we were having to re-position some of our contracts in Texas because the lives wound up landing in certain payers where we did not have relationships. Over the last three or four months, we've been able to improve our position in that particular market, and I'm encouraged by the amount of contracting we've been able to do. So as we move forward, I think we should be in a better position, depending upon, obviously, the population of lives within the exchange. But nonetheless, our overall contracting position and participation in payer contracts in the exchange in Texas have improved.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, and this is Milt. Just on your question about short-term versus long-term, we're seeing some sequential improving trends in our managed care adjusted admissions. We reported we were down 1.9% in the first quarter of this year. Now that does include we're comping to leap year last year, and some impact of that would be leap year. But we're flat with managed care and other on the second quarter. So sequentially, the trends are improving, and we hope that we can continue to leverage off this.","But \u2013 so it's hard to call right now into the long-term effect here, but when we look at the overall health insurance \u2013 employer health insurance marketplace, it continues to be in very good shape. And with respect to the number of covered lives, so that gives me some optimism about the future, and if we can execute our growth strategies, especially our strategies focused around the commercial book, including putting more capital in place that was referenced earlier in the call, I'm optimistic that we can continue and go back to a growth trend with respect to our commercial book.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Sarah, thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Thanks. I'm going to try to \u2013 I don't know. I can't say it's a two-part even question, but just two areas. Can you just comment a little more on what's going on with the self-pay? The uncompensated care and bad debt are jumping around, but it sounds like the self-insured volumes you're seeing are pretty much in line with what you thought, if not even maybe a little better this quarter.","And then I was just going to ask also when your capital \u2013 you've stepped up the acquisition pace, but you also stepped up the buybacks, so that was encouraging to see sequentially. Can you sustain the buyback pace with the enhanced acquisition activity?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, A.J., just because you've been around for long, we'll let you do two different questions at once.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, A.J.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill, you want to take that?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, A.J., let me take the bad debts, and I'll talk about the share repurchase, too, and let Milton add on. So we know our bad debts are reading in terms of year-over-year a little elevated. And obviously, we talked about before, we think if you look at our total uncompensated care, which includes our bad debts, charity and uninsured, in any given quarter you are subject to some classification trends among these categories, but generally speaking, over time, our uncompensated care trends track with our uninsured volume trends.","And as we mentioned, we're seeing roughly a 4% to 5% growth in uninsured admissions, 4.9% in the second quarter. That's a little higher than we ran in the last half of 2016 and first quarter, but as you mentioned, pretty much in line with our expectations in that low-single digit. On a dollar basis, we ran about 5.4% more uncompensated care in Q2 than we did in Q4 of 2016. And on adjusted net revenue basis, that's looking at uncompensated care as a percent of revenue, year to date we're running at 34% versus 33% in full year 2016. So, we realize that did trend up, but overall, the uncompensated care trends are tracking right with our uninsured volume trends.","We remain really pleased with our revenue cycle collection efforts. Our collection results around deductibles and co-pays remain consistent. We don't see any deterioration in the deduct and co-pay part of the receivables. Our collections continue to keep pace. As Milton mentioned, our net days is 49. Cash as a percentage of revenue over 100%. So, it's pretty much in line with what our expectations are in terms of year-over-year basis when you are subject to some fluctuation on that.","Regarding the capital deployment, as you know today, we are able to continue to complete our share repurchase authorization. We plan on completing that by the end of this year. And we can continue to complete the acquisition pipelines that we see in front of us. Just given the strength of our cash flow and the strength of the position of the balance sheet, we're able to do both of those strategies without any interference on that.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Not much to add other than to say, I think that the strength of our balance sheet, our cash flow distinguishes HCA, gives the ability to continue to invest approximately $3 billion of capital this year back in our existing markets to complete our share repurchase plan and to make some strategic acquisitions. So this is really in line with now our financial approach in terms of capital allocation, and we're very pleased to be able to supplement the acquisitions through our strategy this year.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, A.J.","Operator","Next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks very much. I must confess, first of all, on the cash flow side, there's no question. It's copious. You're applying it brilliantly. I get that. But I have to come back to this managed care number because I'm actually quite confused. And it's really a big important factor in your leadership and your margins, and all the rest of that. So forgive me if I beat this dead horse. I thought you said that your managed care admissions same-store year-over-year were down 1.3%. And then, I thought I heard Milt say that it was flat. So...","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","No, Sheryl, it was adjusted admissions flat in the managed care and exchange book for the second quarter. Admissions only, down 1.3%. So that's the distinction between the two numbers.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, good. So I get that. If we can focus on the inpatient for a minute and try to parse this number out, and I'll just ask the question very simply. Are the troubles you're having with managed care admissions, because they're down, directly and only related to what you're seeing in the exchanges, or is there non-exchange impact there as well?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Sam, do you want to...","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I think it's a little of both. It's more pronounced inside of the exchanges than it is the commercial. I think one thing that's really relevant here is obstetrics on the commercial side is roughly, I don't know, 20% of overall commercial demand, give or take a few points. And with commercial obstetrics volume being down 2.5% to 3%, it weighs out to be 0.6%, so it explains half of our decline. And then, when you layer on some of the kicks, declines in enrollment, it gets us closer to what's happening in the market. So I think from that standpoint, that's how I would color it.","Obviously, we've seen some softening in our low acuity emergency room business. Again, as I mentioned in our first quarter call last April that we are seeing some competition in that space with urgent care, some freestanding emergency rooms that have evolved in certain markets, and that puts some pressure on the lower acuity side of the business. But our upper level acuity is actually growing in our emergency room. And I think that's indicative of the kind of programs we've added through stroke programs, comprehensive stroke centers, trauma, and the like. And so we're seeing those dynamics, and that's having a little bit of an effect as well on our admission rates.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Can I just follow-up on that?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Okay, go ahead.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I appreciate that, because that's really interesting. So, the low acuity cases, which I'm sure you're not sorry to not have, not being there, is that what's driving the higher percentage admission of cases in the ER?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, yes, that's sort of mathematical in that. Obviously, we get more admission rate on the higher acuity patients. So as a percentage of our total ER business, if in fact that's the component that's growing, we're going to see a higher admission rate. And our ER admission rate, like I said, in total was up 1.2%. I don't have the exact commercial admission rate. It's slightly up, if I remember correctly, from like 12.6% to 12.8% on the commercial side, indicative, again, of the higher acuity components of our ER business.","And let me say this, we clearly want the lower acuity business somewhere in our system. That's why we're investing heavily in urgent care, and we continue to invest in freestanding emergency rooms, because it allows us to develop a relationship with our patients and ultimately integrate them inside the HCA system. So we still have a very significant investment strategy and development strategy around urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms, other outpatient centers that start to introduce our systems to patients in commercial markets. So I'm encouraged by what we're doing there, and we have a lot of capital in the pipeline in those areas, and I think it's going to position us well in these markets as we move forward.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Sheryl, thank you.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Milton, just a question on acquisitions. You alluded to a good pipeline there. So as we see organic volumes moderate, just like what Sam was discussing, I mean, is this a proactive strategy to bolster volumes, or is this more opportunistic as you have done nine acquisitions so far? And also, are you willing to go into new markets if that opportunity arises, or is it all in-market tuck-ins?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Brian, thanks for the question. First of all, it's a mix as far as tuck-in acquisitions. Some of the acquisitions we've announced have been smaller hospitals that complement our existing markets, and Houston is a great example, one in south Texas, it'll complement our San Antonio market. We have, of course, announced Savannah, which would be a new market for HCA. We were very pleased with that opportunity to acquire that facility. And that, again, is example of maybe \u2013 I think it's the first significant new market we've had a chance to enter into since probably 2003. So yeah, it's a combination of both.","And we're seeing the strategy \u2013 number one, it's something that we have been pursuing. We're seeing more opportunities in the marketplace now. I think as many health systems, again, went through the positive environment from 2015 and early 2016, and now we're seeing some volume pressures. We're looking, I think, to be part of the bigger system. And so we are encouraged by that. We think we have a lot to offer as far as opportunity for many of these systems. So it is opportunistic, but it is also consistent with our strategy. So, we're pleased to see the pipeline more robust than it has been in recent years.","These transactions, we'll see if we can continue to get these to closure, but we are excited about the acquisitions, and we think it can be complementary to our growth story. As you know, over the past decade plus, HCA has been primarily an organic growth company. It tells of the richness and the depth of our markets and the population growth of many of our markets. And we continue to see that opportunity, but certainly, these acquisitions can complement that. And we are encouraged and excited about the opportunity.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Brian, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. I'm wondering if you can touch on the decline in the operation surgery cases in the quarter year-over-year, and maybe touch on your view on whether that's more competitive related, or whether you're seeing just some general industry softness there.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Scott, thank you. Sam, do you want that?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","That's a good question. As far as outpatient surgery, we have had a few quarters now where we've been flat to slightly down or slightly up, but not anywhere where we want to be. That was a little more difficult for us to draw definitive conclusions around simply because we don't get as much good data. So it's more anecdotal than it is empirical. I would say, though, our instincts are and our intuition around the marketplace is there has been general softening, number one. Number two, there's a lot of competition in outpatient surgery space because it's lower capital, and in many markets, there's no certificate of need.","So there have been a few competitive dynamics in the market here or there. But we're pretty opportunistic with our approach to our outpatient surgery. We have a multi-venue offering both in the hospital and outside of the hospitals in our ambulatory surgery center division. We continue to add units to our ambulatory surgery center division through acquisitions and new development, in addition to bringing more physicians into our partnerships inside of those ambulatory surgery centers.","So I'm encouraged by what our teams are doing to try to recover and grow in this particular segment. I do think the softening in the emergency room has a trickle-down effect on outpatient surgeries. Typically, we will see outpatient surgery activity from emergency room traffic 90 days to 120 days out. And because our emergency room business has softened somewhat, we think that's having an influence over our outpatient surgery. But nonetheless, we have a very aggressive effort at working with our physicians, investing in equipment, investing in facilities when we need to improve our overall position and sustain growth in this area.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Scott, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I was hoping I could get some more color as to what's going on in London. I mean a 30% to 35% decline in EBITDA seems pretty remarkable, and does seem like it could move the needle at least within the EBITDA guidance range. I mean, what's \u2013 particularly on the Middle Eastern side? I'm just having a \u2013 would love to get a better sense for what you guys think is driving that pressure and (42:31)","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Chris, thanks. Sam?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sam. I just actually got back from London a couple of weeks ago. I was visiting with our team for most of the week. And over the past few quarters, we have seen softening in our Middle East embassy business in London. I think a couple of drivers. One is we believe there's competition for the Middle East business because it's a productive payer for us and for others. So there's competition in Germany, Singapore, and even in the United States for Middle East business, and so there's that factor that probably intensified over the past few years having some impact.","Our intuition, again, is that with some of the difficulties in the energy economy, that's slowing the trends down on out-migrations from in-country healthcare to other countries. That's a piece of it. So that's having an influence as well. But all in all, our London operations continue to operate around a 20% local currency margin. It did in fact impact our growth rate this past quarter by a decent amount for a small division, if you will, and that's why we called it out. As Bill alluded to, we anniversaried some of those issues in the second quarter, and we believe in the last half of the year some of those anniversaried issues will start to normalize and not produce the impact that it did in the quarter. The second quarter by itself was a very difficult quarter for us in London.","I do think we're in the midst of repositioning our facilities, our network, our capabilities in London, and somewhat changing our business model to be less reliant on Middle East business and more reliant on local business, self-pay business, and some of the struggles that exist in the NHS system over there with waste and physician dissatisfaction and so forth. So we're investing in outpatient facilities, urgent care facilities, imaging facilities, working with our physicians on physician clinics and so forth to replicate aspects of what we're doing in the U.S. to build out a very user friendly, efficient facility complement in London.","And I'm very encouraged by what our teams are doing and how they're working through this transition. We've made some significant cost structure adjustments. We're leveraging learnings in our cost structure over here more effectively over there. So I'm anticipating a recovery over the next 12 months to 18 months in our London operations that will put us on a different trajectory.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thanks, Sam. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Just want to go to guidance; midpoint suggests EBITDA growth of 2.5%. And when I look back to last year, EBITDA grew a little bit under 4%. Just wanted to see if you can help with sort of the context of the 4% to 6% long-term EBITDA growth. Is that sort of still fair, particularly with the consensus kind of sitting in that 5% EBITDA growth for 2018? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, Ralph. Bill, do you want...","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, with the long term 4% to 6%, I mean, there's going to be years where that's going to be challenged. We're feeling that here at the midpoint of this year. But when I think about it, again, it is long-term guidance. When I look back over the last five years, I think our EBITDA, our growth CAGR is just under 6%. So I know we had to push there from health reform with that. But when we break that out, probably no more than a third of our growth in that period came from reform, and two-third came from the core business. So, we feel like on a long-term basis, that that's still a reasonable range for prior performance.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ralph.","Operator","Next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. A question for Bill. I just want to go back to the bad debt expense for a moment. Of that $1.73 billion this quarter, what percentage of that is co-pay deductible reserving? And I'm just trying to understand how that number can be up 41% year-over-year and sequentially if the collectability is unchanged, is all of that just reclassification?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thanks, Gary.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, Gary, so historically of our own compensated care, two-thirds is coming from the uninsured population, a third coming from our insured through deductibles and Cos. And as I said, as we look at the deductibles and Cos, the trends that we're seeing there are remaining very consistent, and our cash collections are remaining very consistent. So we don't see any deterioration in that segment of the book that gives us a concern.","Regarding the bad debts alone, you are subject from time-to-time, as we've seen in the past, with just some classifications between uninsured discounts, charity, and bad debts. Some of that's on time you know write offs versus the reserve for the provision. So that's why I think it's important you look at the total uncompensated care. To answer your overall question, we remain about a third of that's coming from deducts and Cos, and about two-thirds from the uninsured population.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thanks, Gary.","Operator","Next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the volumes that you talked about for managed Medicare or Medicare Advantage, which shows quite a positive in your reports today. Is that uniform across all markets?","You also talked about some markets like San Francisco and Houston being down, and I was wondering if that's got to do with capitated contracts with primary care docs? And is that likely to intensify, or is it leveling off and is more competitive?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","We didn't mention San Francisco. We said South Florida.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Sorry, South Florida, I meant. South Florida.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Sorry.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I was going to say, we've got some assets I didn't know about. I thought I knew just about everything in HCA. So I think in South Florida, as I mentioned in a couple of calls ago, we still are seeing some pressure from our managed care providers in how they're classifying certain patients between observation and inpatient. And when I add the two together, we're actually up in South Florida. But unfortunately, for admissions, it doesn't count as an admission. We continue to work with our physicians and these managed care payers to make the right decisions on those status-ing, and we're improving that a little bit, but that's the driver in that particular market.","In Houston; Houston, I don't know if you've seen it or not, but there's a lot of carnage in Houston with respect to system changes, leadership changes, and so forth. Houston is a difficult market because the economy has really suffered with oil prices and so forth. We've actually stabilized in Houston from a financial standpoint, but we have continued to see significant volume pressures, but it's been localized at a couple of our hospitals and not nearly as broad based as it was maybe a year or so ago.","So that's the two markets that had the most pronounced weakness. As far as Medicare Advantage and Medicare business, that's generally consistent across the company. That's a natural phenomenon that's going on in the marketplace this year, just like it was going on last year. Our pricing continues to be very consistent between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare. We do see some of these status-ing issues from one market to the other, but overall we are very positive about what's going on with our Medicare growth.","Now, I'll tell you, our Medicare business growing at 2.5% to 3%, or whatever that number was, is part of why our margins are down. People are asserting that our costs are up. It's really because the composition of our business is lower profitability on Medicare than it is commercial. And so as it grows, it puts a little bit of pressure on our margins, and that's part of the challenge that we had so far this year. But as that starts to stabilize and we start to see some recovery hopefully in our commercial book, we can recover that and get our margins back to where we want them to be.","But we have a lot of markets that are growing. As I mentioned, North Florida, Tennessee, and Continental had great quarters. A handful of our other divisions grew around 1% or so. And then, we had a few that were down around 0.5 point to 1 point. So still a solid performance across the portfolio, a solid performance across the different service lines, and just a continued pattern of incremental growth organically in a marketplace that's cooled down a little bit. And we think, again, that's somewhat cyclical.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","You're welcome. We've got time for one last question.","Operator","Next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. I'm going to try to apply for the A.J. waiver, see if I can (51:43). We did a quick calc of the revenue that you're acquiring. It looks like around $2.5 billion. Do you think you can, over time, get those margins to your company average? I mean, that's where the big EBITDA number, obviously.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","First of all, let me just clarify \u2013 this is Milton, John. Let me just clarify on the amount of revenue. Looking at the acquisitions that we have announced, including the hospitals that we've closed, and that would be Waycross and Tomball, and the South Texas facility from Community. And then, we've announced, of course, the three hospitals from Tenet in the Houston market, the recently announced Sebring, Weatherford, and Memorial Savannah. So if you look at the last 12 months' revenue on all those acquisitions, it would be about $1.5 billion \u2013 or probably $1.6 billion of incremental revenue annually, not $2.5 billion.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, and this is Sam. On the margin side, clearly, when we are acquiring facilities inside an existing market where we have infrastructure and capabilities to support those particular facilities with local infrastructure and then layer on the corporate infrastructure, we do see prospects for achieving end market margins.","Now, our markets have different margins. Some margins are higher in one market or the other. So to say company average, I have to look at it more specifically around the individual markets. The Savannah operation, as Milton said, is a new market for us. It is a market-maker, as I mentioned on the last call, because of the certificate need offerings that it already has in the State of Georgia. We believe there's a lot of opportunity in that particular facility. It will take us longer to get it than it will hospitals that are in market, but we do believe over a four to five year period, we're going to be in a really good position financially with this particular investment and this particular hospital.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, John, I guess we'll give you the A.J. waiver. What's your second?","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Just more of a strategic question. Consumer elasticity grows every year with high co-pay plans and deductibles. And it looks to me where you've got some exposure to lower cost competitors, such as ASC, physician-owned on ASC and maybe some of the alternatives to ER, your volume trends have been a little off as the ACA effect is waived. Do you look at that and say, maybe we need to layer in some more lower cost options versus just kind of the hospital-based higher cost?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, this is Sam again. I think it's important for everyone to understand, HCA has over 1,700 facilities providing care to our patients. We have 170 plus hospitals, which clearly are the largest component of our revenue, and the destination within our networks and our network system. But we are adding significantly to the number of outpatient facilities, urgent care, freestanding emergency room, ambulatory surgery, as I mentioned previously, physician clinics, breast centers, all of these different components that make it easier for the patient to access, create geography dispersion for our network, and put us in a situation where we can gain a relationship with a patient and hopefully keep them in the HCA system.","So we're clearly doing that right now and investing in more as we look at some of this capital that's in our pipeline. So that is a part of what we're doing. Strategically, though, we still want to downstream this business into our facilities whenever this more acute care is needed. And so that's a fundamental piece of our strategy. It's a fundamental piece of our investments. And it's how we market ourselves, if you will, to the consumer in these large markets.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, John, this is Milton, and I'll end with this. So, as Sam's saying, it's not that we're not investing. We're already investing in it. We see the strategy. I think what we're seeing in the marketplace is a lot of competition in that same space. I think that's what you may be referencing. It's a low capital entry point into healthcare and our market, so we're seeing more competition, but again, I think with HCA, with what Sam's describing and our overall network capability, that over time we'll see some of that rationalize. And so I think we're feeling some competitive pressure from these markets in those lower cost entry points, but I think over time our performance will continue to be very strong.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. John, thank you very much. And I thank everyone. Hope you all have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11021":["HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","April, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and also those of you listening to the webcast.","With me here this morning our Chairman, CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, CFO.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.","Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future results.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release. As you heard the call is being recorded and replay will be available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. Before we go into details about the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael which have recently affected our facilities and colleagues in the Southeast U.S.","On September 14, Hurricane Florence made landfall in South Carolina and on October 10 hurricane Michael made landfall in Panama City, Florida. Immediately before and after the storms, we evacuated several hundred patients to other facilities and without patient harm. Both storms had a devastating effect on the communities we serve in Florida and the Carolina's and where our HCA colleagues live and work.","Throughout these events, our colleagues in the affected areas and across the enterprise have supported our emergency operations efforts, our patients and each other. Our robust disaster preparedness plans give us confidence when facing weather disasters like this, but it's the teamwork and patient-centered commitment of our HCA Healthcare colleagues that make those plans work so well. I'm very proud of that teamwork and professionalism.","Now let me provide some comments on third quarter results. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Consistent with recent results, we saw solid volume and rate growth, increased intensity of service and excellent expense management which resulted in solid adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter.","This morning, we also favorably revised our earnings guidance ranges to reflect results for the nine months ending September 30 and expectations for the remainder of the year. More on this later in my comments. Revenues in the third quarter totaled $11.451 billion, up 7.1% from the previous year's third quarter.","Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. increased 78% to $759 million or $2.15 per diluted share compared to $426 million or $1.15 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Bill will provide more detail on these items in a moment.","Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased to $2.096 billion an 18% increase over the prior year which included the negative impact from both hurricanes in the third quarter of last year and Texas Medicaid waiver payments. Additionally, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA growth rate was unfavorably impacted by an estimated 310 basis points from the sale of Oklahoma University assets.","Year-to-date, through September, our adjusted EBITDA totaled $6.441 billion compared to $5.871 billion in the same period of 2017, an increase of 9.7%. Cash flows from operations were very strong, totaling $1.721 billion up from last year's \u2013 $1.008 billion last year. We invested $846 million in capital spending in our existing markets, repurchased 2.5 million of our shares at a cost of $302 million and also paid a dividend of $121 million during the third quarter of 2018.","This morning we updated our guidance ranges for 2018. Revenues are now projected to range from $46 billion to $47 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to range from $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion. And diluted earnings per share is now estimated to range from $9.05 to $9.45 per diluted share.","In September, we announced my retirement as CEO at year-end and the appointment of Sam Hazen as CEO effective January 1, 2019. So today after approximately 80 HCA quarterly earnings calls, this will be my last as an active participant.","Since January 1, 2014, it's been my privilege to be the CEO of this great company. I've had the distinct pleasure of getting to know many of you over my 36 years at HCA. This is a wonderful company with many talented people who are committed to the delivery of high-quality patient care and operational excellence.","I am extremely proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved as a team including advancing the company's clinical agenda which focuses on delivery of high-quality patient care and improving patient satisfaction.","HCA is well-positioned for the future under Sam's leadership and I remain excited about the company's future.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I feel like I should pause there just for a moment, recognize your leadership and the example you've set for all of us. So as Milton mentioned, we are pleased with our results as the company reported a solid third quarter.","On an as-reported basis our adjusted EBITDA was $2.096 billion or an 18% increase from our $1.776 billion reported in the third quarter of last year. There are a few items I would like to discuss that impacted the year-over-year comparisons.","First is the hurricane impact we experienced in the third quarter of 2017 where both hurricane Harvey and Irma impacted our prior-year results. You will recall we estimated a loss of revenues and additional expenses of approximately $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share in last year's third quarter.","During the third quarter of this year hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas. Due to a mandatory evacuation order we had to evacuate all of our patients from our Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Hospital. We estimate that we had an approximately $9 million impact associated with Florence in this quarter.","Second, the results for the third quarter of 2017 also included a negative impact to operating results related to the final settlement amounts for the program year ended September 30, 2017 for the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program of approximately $80 million or $0.08 per diluted share.","And third, as noted in our release this morning, based on the receipt of updated actuarial information we recorded a reduction to the company's reserves for professional liability risk of $70 million or $0.15 per diluted share in this year's third quarter.","Finally, as we have noted in our previous quarters based on its contribution last year we estimate the sale of our Oklahoma facilities had a negative impact of approximately 310 basis points on the growth rate of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.","Our new facilities, which are primarily those facilities purchased in 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in the third quarter, which was consistent with a negative EBITDA in the third quarter of 2017. So even when you adjust for these items we are pleased with the performance and adjusted growth we experienced in the quarter.","So now let me give you some more detail on the performance of some key operating metrics for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2017 starting with volume results by payer class. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 3.5% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 12.6% on a same facility basis and represented 37.6% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 2.6%, while equivalent admissions increased 0.6%. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 8.8%. These also represented 8.8% of our total admissions compared to 8.3% in the prior-year period.","Texas and Florida still represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions. Managed care admissions increased 2.1% and equivalent admissions increased 4% on a same facility basis, a continuation of solid results. Same facility emergency room visits declined 0.4%. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 21% of our total ER visits compared to 20.2% in the prior-year period. The decline in ER visits was primarily driven in our low-acuity ER visits.","Our level one through level three ER visits declined 3.8% but our level four and five visits increased 1.8%. This is very similar to what we saw in the second quarter as well. Also our same facility inpatient admissions through the ER increased approximately 3.3% in the quarter.","Intensity of service or acuity increased with our same facility case mix increasing 3.8%. Same facility surgeries increased 3.2%. The same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.6% and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.2%. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter.","Our hospital-only same facility managed care revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.8% in the quarter. Our same facility total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care and uninsured discounts, totaled $6.342 billion in the quarter as compared to $5.616 (12:11) billion reported in the prior year. This growth was in line with our volume and pricing results.","Now turning to expenses and operating margin. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points from 16.6% in the third quarter last year to 18.3% on an as reported basis. Some of the improvement on margin can be attributed to loss of revenue and increased costs in the prior-year's third quarter due to hurricanes. The sale of our Oklahoma facilities and our new facilities had an estimated 110 basis points unfavorable impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2018.","Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.8% compared to last year's third quarter. This metric benefited from the impact of the prior-year hurricanes. Adjusted for this, the current year increase is in line with recent trends. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues were 46.9% compared to 47.5% in last year's third quarter.","On a same facility basis salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 43.7% versus 44.8% last year and same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable.","Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.5% this quarter as compared to 16.6% in last year's third quarter. On a consolidated basis supplies as a percent of revenue declined 10 basis points and same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3% for the third quarter compared to the prior-year period.","Other operating expenses declined 100 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.4% of revenues. This includes the $70 million reduction in our provision for professional liability risk recorded in the third quarter.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.721 billion for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $1.008 billion in last year's third quarter, which is an increase of almost 71%.","Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.721 billion, less capital expenditures of $846 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of $130 million and dividends paid to shareholders of $121 million was $624 million in the quarter compared to $164 million in Q3 of 2017.","At the end of the quarter, we had $2.382 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.76 times at September 30, 2018, compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017.","Now moving to earnings per share, our diluted earnings per share in the quarter totaled $2.15, up from $1.15 in the third quarter of last year. Our EPS was impacted by the items I've previously discussed, as well as a $0.37 per diluted share tax benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Also, we estimate our divestiture of OU operations, coupled with the impact of our new facilities had an approximately $0.10 negative impact on EPS in the quarter as compared to the prior year.","So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year. In general, our volume growth in the quarter was consistent with the prior two quarters growth.","Additionally, we continued to demonstrate broad-based growth across the company's divisions and across our various service lines. My comments will focus on our same facility, domestic operations.","12 of 14 divisions had growth in both admissions and adjusted admissions. 5 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 11%, while hospital-based emergency room visits declined 1.8%. Once again, higher acuity visits grew while lower acuity visits declined.","Admissions through the emergency room, as Bill indicated, grew by 3.3%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 4.9% and 1.5% respectively, reflecting the higher acuity visits we are seeing in our emergency rooms.","In-patient surgeries were up 1.8%. Surgical admissions were 27.3% of total admissions in the quarter generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continued to be strong in cardiovascular vascular and orthopedic service lines. 11 of 14 divisions had growth in in-patient surgeries.","Outpatient surgery showed strong growth. Hospital-based surgeries were up 5%. And our freestanding ambulatory surgery centers were up 3.8%. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries.","Behavioral health admissions grew 2.4%. Rehab admissions grew 8.3%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 2.3%, driven mostly by growth in electrophysiology services.","Births were down 1.2% and neonatal admissions were down 1.6%. Urgent care visits for the company were down 2.8% on a same facilities basis. They were up however, 12% on a consolidated basis reflecting the growth in the number of overall centers.","HCA has now grown same-facility admissions in 18 consecutive quarters. Before I finish my comments, I want to take this time to acknowledge Milton and thank him for his outstanding leadership and for being a great colleague. With almost 37 years of service with the company, Milton has had a tremendous career. On behalf of the senior team and the Board of Directors, we wish him the best upon his retirement at the end of the year.","Also I want to share a few thoughts I shared with our board about the company's current state and my view on the company's near-term future. I believe this consistent pattern of growth that HCA demonstrates is a result of multiple factors. First, macro trends at our markets are mostly positive, demand growth is solid and trending favorably, pricing trends remain stable and we believe we have good visibility into them over the next few years, and the competitive environment remains fragmented, which creates an advantage for us given our scale and diversification.","Second, the company's growth agenda underneath these macro trends is once again yielding solid market share gains. Our overall competitive position and our diversified portfolio of markets is strong, as a result of improvements in quality outcomes, improvements in nursing performance and strategic capital spending which is adding appropriate inpatient and surgical capacity along with more outpatient facilities to serve our patients conveniently.","And third, HCA is fortunate to have a deep and experienced management team that is fully engaged and relentlessly focused on execution and delivering results that create value for our patients, our employees, our physicians and our shareholders. I believe these three factors will continue to support our business in 2019.","Typically, we do not provide any indication into the upcoming year at this point. But with the transition in leadership, I felt it important to give a glimpse into the upcoming year. While we can never predict with certainty how our business will perform, the environment in 2019 appears positive in general across our markets. And specifically with respect (20:33-20:42).","Our planning process for 2019 is not finished. As usual, we will provide you more details in January when we formally issue guidance for the year. An early look however at 2019 indicates that we expect solid volume growth again and an adjusted EBITDA growth rate somewhere within a reasonable range of this year's currently expected full year growth rate.","As we always do at HCA, we will challenge ourselves to find opportunities to enhance performance. I have been with HCA for 36 years and it is truly an honor to be the next CEO. HCA is a great company and I look forward to working with our employees and physicians as we strive to achieve our mission which is fundamentally to give our patients the care they deserve.","With that let, me turn the call over to Vic for questions.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Sam, and everyone. With that April, if you will open the queue for questions. And I do encourage each of you to limit your questions to one because I think we have several in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First, let me just first say goodbye to Milton. It's been a good run, and Sam, congratulations on the new role, well-deserved. And thank you very much for providing that 2019 viewpoint. I know everyone appreciates it. So that's, my question is going to be around that. Specifically, Sam, you said growth for 2019 should be in the range of 2018. 2018, obviously, had a lot of moving parts in terms of good guys and bad guys, but the reported number looks like about 7%. So I just want to confirm that that's what your \u2013 that's the number we should kind of focus on there for expected growth year-over-year in EBITDA?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, Justin this is Bill. Our midpoint of our guidance, you're right would suggest just under a 7% as reported year-over-year growth.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And your \u2013 that's \u2013 there's no other moving parts we should kind of expect a range, kind of midpoint of a range, for next year could be about that 7%? Is that what you're (23:14) implying?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, I don't want to give percentage, we obviously \u2013 yeah, I don't want to give specific percentages on there. As we look at the factors, we look at the trends around the core growth, we look at \u2013 capital continue to come online. We look at the turn of the trend on acquisitions and all of those together, believe that we should be within a reasonable range of this year's growth rate.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And if I could just follow-up with the \u2013 for Q4, your implied guidance seems to have a core growth rate in the 3.5% range. So I'm curious if there are any moving parts I should be thinking about there, maybe there's hurricane weakness in that Q4 given the hurricanes down South or any other kind of moving parts, obviously, it seems like there's a little bit of a difference between 3.5% and 7% for next year.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. So let me call out a couple points when you're looking at our guidance and then what the expected range of growth for this year's fourth quarter is. First, just remind everybody, the fourth quarter of 2017 was an extremely strong quarter for us. We posted a little north of 7% growth over the prior year in that quarter.","Second, when we look at the sequential Q3 to Q4 growth, our estimate would be similar, somewhat exceed what we typically see. We've studied the seasonality and we've factored that into our guidance.","Third, as you mention, we do have some uncertainty regarding the Q4 impact of Hurricane Michael on our Florida Panhandle operations. We tried to factor a reasonable estimate into that for the quarter into our guidance.","And finally, when I really look at our updated guidance as you see at the midpoint we've increased approximately $50 million at the midpoint. It's basically accounting for the professional liability pickup we had this quarter offset by some impact of Michael in the quarter as well. So that's really the factors that went into our overall guidance for the balance of the year.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, thanks for all the questions.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thank you, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","And, Milton's really not going away.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I am.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I was going to say one thing on 2019 guidance just to be clarified too, it does not include acquisitions such as Mission. That is not included in the range that Sam stated, just to make that clear as well.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thanks again.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, and congratulations, Milton, and best wishes. I guess, to follow-up on that capital deployment and acquisition question. I'm just curious, is there anything that we should expect to be different with regard to just the cadence of capital deployment that might affect sort of how your volume growth plays out over the next year? And then on the topic of Mission Health any thoughts around you specifically would fund that transaction? Thanks.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yes. Frank I'll start with the latter. We're still in the process with the Mission Health acquisition. Likely that would be a public market event, but we'll evaluate that just as we get closer and have visibility of a close date. Regarding capital next year and impact, obviously we'll talk about that further when we give, when we complete our planning process and give full year 2019 guidance with specifics. The capital will be a factor that will help contribute the growth trajectory of the company.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yes, this is Sam, Frank. I mean we have about $4.5 billion to $5 billion of capital in our pipeline. We will have a little bit more come online in 2019 than we had in 2018. It comes online at different points in the year, so it will have different impacts if you will on our volume.","But I don't think it's going to materially change our volume trends or expectations as we finish up this year and go into next year. We are seeing improving demand in our markets as I mentioned in our call, I mean in my comments rather, and we've seen that now for roughly three or four straight quarters. So we are encouraged by that. And then as I mention, we are starting to see market share gains again which is encouraging with what we're doing in the marketplaces around our growth agenda.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thank you Frank.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks guys. And congratulations to both on the transition in management. My question is regarding the, is HCA entering into a new phase of your growth? You talked about, I know you talked about the 7%-ish growth in EBITDA for next year as being next year, but your long-term guidance of 4% to 6% that's above that and then we start looking at acquisitions and you're starting to see some acquisitions outside your markets of significant hospital systems, whether it be Savannah or Ashville. So are we approaching a new phase of growth for you guys in terms of new markets?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","This is Sam. I think Ashville and Savannah uniquely offered up opportunities for the company that met our criteria. Both of those systems are fundamentally market-makers in the sense that they can execute on their own what we believe to be the right provider system strategy.","So we're still going to remain selective around those criteria that we use to determine whether or not an acquisition fits our model. I would hope that we would see continued opportunities for new markets. Obviously, our interest is primarily inside of our existing portfolio, but to the extent we see a new market that presents a system that has the wherewithal to go the distance if you will, we would be very interested in that. Now obviously those systems come up when they come up. We can't really forecast that, but we will continue to be opportunistic around those situations when they present themselves.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Pete, thank you.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there some change that's causing that, them to show up now as opposed to over the last decade?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well the story around Savannah and Mission are totally different. Savannah was in a desperate situation, needed more capital, needed professional management and so forth. Mission, conversely is a very successful system, well manage, great physicians, great financial results and so forth. They just viewed the need for scale as being very significant at least in their thinking and their board made a decision to go down that path with us.","So it just depends on the circumstances. Obviously, we believe Savannah has incredible long-term potential and the size of that healthcare market is about one million people when you consider the rural market, which is very similar to the Ashville market in the Western North Carolina rural markets combined. So those kind of situations are really dependent upon the individual circumstances and the strategic analysis that each of the board's take.","So I don't know, if there's anything today that's materially different that would suggest there's going to be more, but we'll just have to wait and see how that goes. I think the company is poised to take on more both from a balance sheet standpoint as well as an organizational capacity standpoint. And we think over time these are going to be very productive healthcare systems for the company. Thank you.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Pete.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. And congrats to both of you guys. Bill, just a couple quick questions for you. As I think about the DNA accrual for the quarter it ticked up year-over-year and sequentially, anything to call out there? And then just back to the question on funding for Mission. Are you thinking of using unsecured notes on that one? And also what are your thoughts on investment grade? Thanks.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. On the depreciation that growth is really just factor of our same store as well as new acquisitions that are fueling that and pretty much in line with what we anticipated on there. Relative to Mission financing and the specific metrics, too early to call, we'll evaluate that at the time, what the market conditions are, and we'll look at. In terms of our pursuit of investment grade, we haven't stated that as a specific financial goal but I think as we continue to demonstrate consistent performance, strong balance sheet, great cash flow that hopefully over time we'll be recognized for those trends.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And, we'll take our next question from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Since the last call the Medicare IPPS rules finalized for fiscal 2019. So, could you just quantify how much better you think that will be for you than the recent trend and whether there was an incremental Medicare reimbursement factored into the guidance for this calendar year for fourth quarter?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill, are you going to take that?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah, I'll cover that. Thanks for the question. So we are getting a favorable update as we assess it now our update will range between 2.5% to 2.8% growth in our Medicare update. That is compared to approximately 1% we received in recent past. So that's an incremental 1.5% to 1.8% on the Medicare update. We believe we have accommodated for this within the context of our overall guidance range and perhaps will be a factor for us as we look towards 2019 as well.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thank you.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations to Sam and Milton. Wish you the best. I was looking, back of the envelope, looks like the stock is up almost three times since you were named Chairman so that's quite a run in five years, so congratulations on that.","I guess my question would be a lot of the improvement in margin this quarter and the last few quarters has been driven by the top line performance, strong volumes, strong pricing. I wonder if you guys could spend a minute just talking about what's happening on the individual expense line. I know there was a little of that in the prepared remarks. But is there any area where you're seeing the expenses, whether it's labor supplies, other, in and of themselves opportunities for improvement or any place where you're facing a headwind on the cost side?","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","A.J., this is Sam. We are very pleased with the performance of the company operationally over the past year or so. Our teams have stepped up, especially on the human resources side of the equation and had a dramatic impact on our nursing performance. Our nursing contract labor on a year-over-year basis is down significantly. We've been able to increase our hiring as a result of our nursing agenda and human resources agenda.","So at this particular point in time on the labor front, we're not anticipating any unusual headwinds as we turn the calendar into 2019. We will continue to execute on the core elements of what we're trying to get done with being a very productive employer and at the same time a great employer for our employees and we think that's going to yield some dividends as we move forward. Obviously, it's important that we grow our volume simply because we get the operating leverage from that growth given the fixed cost structure of the company.","On the other two categories, I would say that the trends are generally consistent. We're not seeing anything unusual at this particular point in time on either the supply line item or the other operating expenses. We have been able to manage our physician costs effectively in this particular quarter. I think our physician costs as a percent of revenue were consistent with the previous years. So we haven't seen any dramatic shift there as well.","So as we turn into 2019 again, we'll have to get through all the details of our planning over the next 60 days or so but we're not anticipating any material swing in any of the cost trends.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. A.J., thank you very much.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And, we'll move on to our next question from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just quickly wanted to go back. Mission, are you willing to give us an EBITDA run rate? I think we had thought about sort of $130 million to $140 million, I don't know if you want to sort of comment on sort the baseline there? And then my question was really on, you called out hospital-only, same facility revenue per adjusted admission of the 4.8% within managed-care. Is there a reason you make the distinction of hospital only?","And then, if I take that percentage in the adjusted admission number that you had provided, the 4%, it would suggest managed-care revenue up close to 9%. It seems like a pretty hefty number, maybe just some commentary on kind of factors driving that aside from just the easier comp. Thanks.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, yeah. Let me start with that. We give the hospital-only managed care just as you look at the consolidated number gets affected by physician practice, urgent care, and other. So, we just tried to provide some clarity on there. We remain pleased with managed-care number; there is clearly an intensity driver of that as well as pricing factor of that.","We're pleased with our contracting efforts. We've got good visibility into 2019 and 2020 as well pretty consistent terms and condition that we have experienced. There are potentially, when you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, some hurricane impact as a result as you had recovery of some hospital-based outpatient surgeries this year as well.","So, again, overall pleased. That 4.8% is pretty consistent on that stat with what we've seen year-to-date running about the same number. So it's been pretty stable trends for us on that managed-care book.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","And did you want comment on the Mission run rate at this point in time or not?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yeah. I think honestly, it's too early for us to give some commentary on that. As we get into our 2019 guidance and we get closer visibility into that transaction, we'll give you guidance on what we expect the contribution of Mission will be.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. Okay.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you, Ralph.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My question I guess is somewhat similar to one that was just asked, but just to kind of stick with that topic a little bit, I mean, the strength in same-store revenue per admission, it definitely seems to be a common theme really within the overall hospital industry this quarter. You got some nice reacceleration as well. But just curious if you could remind us again how much that's driven by raw pricing benefits or perhaps some acceleration of the mix to, a mix shift to greater acuity in the in-patient setting which has really been talked about a lot about this year. Just want to get more color on that last part in particular. Thanks.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Bill you want that one?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Well, there is clearly an intensity driver of that as we continue to focus our strategic efforts of growing our high intensity business. That's driving that statistic as well. It's why we give you our case mix number, we've seen that grow, pretty consistent in the three to four, sometimes north of that over the past several quarters. And that's really just a function I think of our strategies and new capital and focus on program development is the main driver of that. And as we've seen continue growing demand in the market too, all of those are driving higher in-patient growth that's fueling that revenue per adjusted admission number as well.","Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","And then just to give you some color. This is Sam again. I mentioned in my prepared comments that our trauma volumes were up four-plus-percent. Just to give you another example, bone marrow transplants inside of HCA in the quarter were up 16%. Our orthopedic surgical volumes, which carry a higher revenue per case than average, were up significantly. Cardiovascular services also carrying a higher revenue per case. Those are contributing factors to this. I think when you look fundamentally at the pricing component of our business we're achieving what we thought we would both on the commercial side as well as the governmental side. And then as you look at the strategic agenda of the company which is to create more clinical capabilities, those additional clinical capabilities allow us to take care of more acute patients, provide more complex procedures and that drives our revenue up. Again that's a very powerful model for us, because it's on the same platform of fixed cost. And if we can increase the acuity in our facilities, deliver the higher revenue per patient, put that on top of the same fixed cost that produces decent margin lift for the company.","So that's been our strategy. We continue to execute on it. We think we have headroom in it. As we build out our outpatient facilities in each of our markets we think that opens up the gateway if you will to an HCA provider system. And then when our patients need more complex care we can provide it to them somewhere else in the system. That's fundamentally what we've been about for the past five or six years and we continue to believe that's adding value to the company.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right, thanks, Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh please go ahead.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Josh you're there? All right. Let's move on.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats Milt. Congrats Sam. Look the question is about the managed care payer mix which continues as you state to show improvement. And last time I think you talked a little bit about the labor market data by your various markets. Can you give us any market specific color on what's going on? Your surgical volumes are really strong for a generally, seasonally, weak quarter. And then on the ED side, at what point do you think this might turn potentially even inflect into a positive? At what point, even the level three ED visits stop kind of mix shifting to urgent care or freestanding?","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Ana, that was pretty good. You just snuck three questions in. We'll give you a break.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Again, we had broad-based performance across a lot of our markets in the quarter. And I think that's a continuation of what we've seen in the first half of the year. But in particular, we had strong performance in our DFW market. We had strong performance in our Austin Texas market. Our north Florida markets were very strong in the quarter. So, very powerful results across this wonderful portfolio that we have of markets.","And it's broad-based. It's not just in admission activities. It's in other categories of our business which is encouraging and again reflects the strength of HCA's portfolio not only from a market standpoint, but from a service line standpoint given that we provide so many different services.","As it relates to the emergency room, we have seen growth for the year. It's modest. I mean we're up about 1% for the year. Clearly we benefited earlier in the year from flu activity. We have seen somewhat of a slowdown in supply in our markets with respect to freestanding emergency rooms and certain urgent care center development. So maybe over the long-term, we could possibly start to see some rebound in the emergency room volume.","Again what we are soft in are the lower revenue elements of our emergency room business. Our higher levels of acuity are producing much more revenue per visit than do the lower levels obviously in how we price. And so the profitability impact of it is not as material as one would think. Nonetheless, we have seen some softness. Some of that could possibly be cannibalized by our own urgent care center development which we think is a very strategic element of what we're trying to do in being comprehensive in the offerings of provider system capability and convenience for our patients as well as having different price points if you will for our payer partners. And so from that standpoint, we may be cannibalizing a little bit of our own business. But long term, we think it's strategic to building out the provider capabilities that we think are necessary for us to be responsive to the marketplace.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Super helpful, thank you.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Thank you Ana.","Operator","We'll move to our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I think he must have gotten cut off cause Josh is more verbal than this. All right, anyone else in there?","Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Go to the next one.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right. Next question","Operator","We'll move on to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Just wanted to go back to the Q4 guidance commentary because it's still, trying to square that one out, I guess the last quarter I think you said that the guidance did not include DISH (45:16) which we were kind of estimating was going to be like a $50 million or $60 million boost. So I would've thought that the guidance would have raised by at least that much but then to your point about the liability adjustment minus the hurricane. So why isn't the guidance raised more like $100 million than the $50 million number?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Yes, Kevin. This is Bill. I think your number is a little higher when we equate it to the percentage growth than, I don't think we're seeing that $50 million to $60 million, it's probably more in the $35 million to $40 million level for us. And I do think that as you look at our range of guidance that it could potentially put us on a higher to the midpoint. So I think the range is wide enough to accommodate for that Medicare update.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So you kind of feel like that could get you to the higher end of the range?","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","Potentially, obviously, we got a lot of revenue. There's a lot of pluses and minuses that flow through in any given time. But again, I think, we feel comfortable with where our guidance is today given all the factors that we're looking at.","R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","I think the business dynamics, we're not anticipating any dynamic change as we go from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I mean, it's \u2013 some of this is we think encouraging with respect to how our volumes have sustained themselves over the year.","So we're optimistic that the trends of the company will continue on into the fourth quarter and into 2019 like we mention. So there is a lot of moving parts in our business and, but nonetheless, the key elements are pretty consistent with how we've been operating.","William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.","All right.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So basically this is an in line quarter for you guys, an in line guidance.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome on the call today, including those on the webcast. With me here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President.","Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.","On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. As you know, the call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later today.","With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning. This morning we released our complete second quarter 2015 earnings, which is consistent with the company's preview on July 15. I'll make a few remarks and then I'll turn the call over to Sam and Bill to provide more detail on the quarter's results.","Overall, we're very pleased with the second quarter performance. Consistent with recent trends, the quarter's performance highlighted a strong volume growth, solid expense management and favorable service and payer mix. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.008 billion in the quarter compared to $2 billion last year, and remember that last year included an increase of $142 million in Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue.","Excluding the Waiver revenue adjustment from 2014 results, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.1% over the prior year. And if you normalize for the Waiver payment and contact incentive income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 9.7% over the second quarter of last year, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing by 20 basis points.","Earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude losses and gains on sales, facilities and losses on retirement of debt was $1.37 for the second quarter, above 2015 and 2014. Further adjusting for the $0.20 per share related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue from the second quarter of 2014 results, adjusted earnings per diluted share would have increased 17.1% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. The company had another strong volume quarter with same-facility equivalent admission growth of 4.9% and same-facility admission growth of 4.1% compared to the prior year second quarter. Once again, the strength in volume was broad-based across our markets and our service lines.","Our same-facility ER visits increased 7.4% compared to last year while surgical volumes once again showed solid growth compared to the prior year. We continue to see positive trends in overall market share gains based on the latest data available. Sam will provide more insight into our market share and volume trends in a moment.","Obviously, we're pleased that the Supreme Court has upheld subsidies for enrollees on federally facilitated exchanges. The decision was a positive outcome for our patients, employees and shareholders. As we have said before, we support efforts that improve access by providing affordable coverage for the uninsured. We are pleased to have this decision behind us as we continue efforts to pursue further coverage expansion. With respect to the second quarter of this year, we continue to see the positive effects of the ACA, consistent with our expectations. Bill will provide additional detail in a moment.","Based on the results in the first six months of 2015, we are updating our full-year 2015 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to near the high end of our previous range of $7.55 billion to $7.85 billion and to near the high end of our adjusted EPS range of $4.90 to $5.30 per share. This reflects our stronger than anticipated volume growth year to date. We now estimate that our equivalent admission growth will be in the range of 4% to 5% for the full-year 2015. I encourage you to review the assumptions embedded in our guidance, which are included in our release this morning.","We had a good cash flow quarter, with cash flow from operations totaling $1.057 billion. While down $193 million from the previous year, this is primarily due to an increase of $301 million in income taxes this year. We deployed $558 million in capital spending into our markets and also used $574 million to repurchase 7.347 million shares of our common stock. At June 30, we had repurchased 12.552 million shares under our February 2015 share repurchase authorization and we had $1.06 billion authorization remaining inclusive of our May 2015 share repurchase authorization.","I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased we are to have Tenet Healthcare joining HealthTrust Purchasing Group early next year as a partner member. In 2014, HPG's total supply spend exceeded $23 billion, with approximately 1,350 acute care facilities as members. HPG was selected for supply chain cost management solutions, including immediate contract value and depth of supply chain management expertise. The addition of Tenet will enhance HPG's ability to drive sustained supply cost savings for its memberships.","And in closing, I'm very pleased with the consistent execution by our clinical and operations teams to deliver high-quality patient outcomes and volume growth. Patient safety, quality of care and patient experience are key components of our patient-centric model as we look to strengthen our delivery system capabilities and broaden our access points and our markets. We believe this will continue to position us well in delivering value for all stakeholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thank you, Milton. And good morning, everyone. As Milton indicated, we had a good quarter driven by strong volume growth and solid expense management. I'll provide more details on our performance and our health reform trends in the second quarter.","As we reported, in the second quarter our same-facility admissions increased 4.1% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 4.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class.","During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. This does include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11.2% on a same-facility basis and now represent 32.7% of our total Medicare admissions.","Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.1% and 7.9%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with recent trends. We continue to see strength in our six expansion states, but also have seen strength in our non-expansion states as well. I'll provide additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform remarks.","Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 8.7% in the quarter. These represent 7.1% of our total admissions compared to 6.8% in the second quarter of last year. This is a change of trend from recent quarters. However, let me remind everyone that in last year's second quarter, we had a bit of movement between our uninsured and pending Medicaid numbers as states were slowed by the volume of applications in the early period of expansion. As we've talked about before, I believe it's more meaningful to look at these trends over a longer period. Year-to-date, our same-facility uninsured admissions are down 2.4% from same period last year.","Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 4.3%, and equivalent admissions increased 4.7% on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 7.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.6% last year.","Intensity of service or acuity moderately increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 0.7% compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 2% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.8% after excluding from second quarter of 2014 revenues the $142 million Texas Waiver adjustment we recognized in the second quarter of last year.","Our international division reduced our reported revenue per equivalent admission by approximately 40 basis points, principally due to currency conversion rates, which was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Same-facility managed care and other, which includes exchange, revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.6% in the quarter.","Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $269 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $884 million, a decline of $13 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.415 billion or an increase of $282 million over the prior-year period.","Now turning to expenses. Our expense management in the quarter was, again, very strong. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.5% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins adjusted for the share-based compensation, high-tech revenue and prior Waiver adjustment was up 20 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points from the prior year when adjusted for these items.","Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014 when you exclude the $142 million Waiver adjustment from prior-year revenues. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3.2% for the second quarter compared to the prior-year period. I believe a part of this reflects our growth in surgical volumes along with some isolated pressures in pharmaceuticals and some commodity items in the quarter.","Other operating expenses improved 10 basis points from last year's second quarter to 17.7% of revenues and we did recognize $18 million in electronic health record income compared to $35 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations.","Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter, with cash flows from operating totaling $1.057 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $2.75 billion or a 22.6% increase from prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.627 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at June 30 of 2015 compared to 3.96 times at December 31 of 2014.","So let me touch briefly on healthcare reform. Health reform activity was strong for the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 11,600 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 5,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year. You recall we saw about 9,800 exchange admissions in the first quarter for an 18% increase quarter-to-quarter. And we believe this is largely due to the continuing new enrollment.","We saw approximately 44,700 same-facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to 19,400 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36,900 in the first quarter of 2015. We have history on about 45% of our second quarter HIX volume. And based on our look back at previous coverage, we still estimate about 40% of these admissions were uninsured prior to health reform.","In our six expansion states, same-facility uninsured admissions were up 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2014 and Medicaid admissions were up 16% for the quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, in our expansion states, uninsured admissions are down 39% and Medicaid admissions are up 22.9%. When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed to just under 6% of our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the overall benefit is in line with our expectations.","So that concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was strong in the second quarter, with no unusual factors contributing to the quarter's growth. As I stated on previous earnings calls, we believe this performance continues to reflect improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets and market share gains for the company. We believe the market share gains have been driven by a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda and capital spending that has been invested, both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity.","Our growth in volume was once again broad-based across most of the companies' markets and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, growth in adjusted admissions and growth in emergency room visits. All but three divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions and all but one of our divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for these same-payer classes.","Managed care and exchange emergency room visits grew by 8%. All but one division had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. All but three divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 27.1% of total admissions for the quarter, down slightly from 27.7% in the second quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the ninth straight quarter with growth in inpatient surgeries.","Nine divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries, which were up 0.9% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in eight out of the last nine quarters. Surgeries grew 1.1% in our ambulatory surgery division. We believe that many components of our OR of Choice initiative that are working inside of our hospitals are now contributing to our growth in this division. Additionally, we've recently acquired four new surgery centers in existing markets inside of our ambulatory surgery division. Most service lines had some level of surgical growth, with notable growth in orthopedics and cardiovascular surgery.","Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 2.4%, managed care and exchange deliveries were up 7.3%, neonatal admissions grew 4.6%, behavioral health admissions were up 7.2%, rehab admissions were up 9.9% and average length of stay grew by 1.7%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions.","On a same-facility basis after excluding the Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue adjustment from last year, inpatient revenue for the company grew 5.8%. Outpatient revenue for the company grew 12.5% in the quarter on a consolidated basis and represented 39.9% of total patient revenues. On a same-facility basis, outpatient revenue grew by 9%.","Market share trends for the company's inpatient business for the 12-month period ended December 2014 were generally consistent with past trends. Our market share grew by 22 basis points. As a result, the company's composite market share is around 24.5%. Approximately 68% of our markets increased share across most service line categories.","Overall inpatient demand across HCA markets continued to show sequential strength. Demand growth accelerated in our markets in each of the last three quarters of 2014, with the fourth quarter showing growth of 3.5%. Commercial demand in HCA markets was even more notable for the year, with an increase of over 4%, with sequential acceleration in each quarter. We believe inpatient demand in both the first and second quarters of 2015 were equally strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available.","HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving sustainable market share gains and overall results. We continue to invest in our local networks at significant levels. The anticipated increase in capital spending that we announced last quarter will provide over the next few years more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity, enhanced service line offerings and add equipment for our nurses and for our physicians. In certain markets, capital spending will be deployed for new hospitals and new outpatient facilities.","And finally, managed care and exchange contracting continued to progress as planned. The company is currently contracted for almost 96% of its revenue for 2015, 67% of its revenue for 2016 and 45% of its revenue for 2017. The pricing and the non-pricing terms are generally consistent with the contracts we have renewed over the past couple of years.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Sam. Tracy, if you could come back on and we'll start taking questions. As we always do, I encourage each of you to hold your questions to one at a time and give everybody a chance to ask their question. Tracy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to A. J. Rice from UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. I'm going to slip in a technical question and then ask a broader one. Just the technical question is if you've got this Texas Medicaid Waiver money coming in, is it just in your mind too small to bother to raise the guidance, or why aren't you raising the guidance for the back half of the year, or is there offsets (22:11)?","But then the broader question is one that I got on the preannouncement from a number of people. How do we think about the pull-through on your volumes? When you got the volume strength that you had, some quarters it really seems to leverage down the income statement and, other quarters, maybe the leverage is less than what we thought. I don't know whether that's because you make investments with some of the upside that you have, whether there's some stair-step to the staffing requirements. But I wanted to just conceptually think about that question of, how do we think about volume leverage working its way down the income statement from quarter-to-quarter?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Hi, A. J. I hate to let the first guy cheat, but we'll let you. We'll do two. The technical question on the Waiver and guidance Bill will address and then Sam will talk about pull-through.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, A. J. Let me talk a little bit about the Waiver and your question regarding adjusting our guidance on there. We did make an adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 based on some updated information from CMS on our Waiver program. We recognized an estimated increase, about $17 million related to the program in the second quarter.","Based on the program updates that we mentioned, we now believe the Waiver revenues to be recognized in 2015 will be materially equivalent to the amounts we recognized in 2014, which excludes the impact of the $142 million settlement we recorded last year.","You're right, our original guidance did include an anticipated $70 million reductions, which we no longer anticipate this reduction. Roughly half of this we've already recognized in our year-to-date performance between the first and second quarter, and the rest coming through the second half. So the remaining amount, that $35 million or so, we didn't deem to be material by itself to cause us to raise guidance again, but it does contribute really to our belief we'll be near the high-end of the guidance.","So, Sam, I'll let you take the second part.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Let me start off this way, A. J. First, our margin in the second quarter was well ahead of our internal plan, I'll tell you that. The second point I want to make is our margin in the second quarter compared really to first quarter and the fourth quarter, which is truly the run rate of the company, zero change, almost identical margins for the company in each of those three consecutive quarters. And then when I look at our operating expense per adjusted admission, it's hardly unchanged from fourth quarter to first quarter to second quarter. And the volumes are very, very comparable.","The other thing is we did some margin expansion in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis of 20 basis points. It was not as high as the first quarter, which was uniquely high with our clearance overall.","Some differences between the second quarter and the first quarter, although not incredibly material on each front, but somewhat material and I think contributed to the differences between the second quarter clearance and the first quarter clearance, is the volume in the second quarter wasn't as strong. It was strong, ahead of plan, but not as strong as the first quarter. So there's some lost leverage comparing those two.","The second big macro point is the reform benefit for the company over second quarter-over-second quarter of last year was not as material as first quarter-over-first quarter of last year. And Bill can give you the specifics on that if we need to.","And then at a micro level, I'll tell you there were a few pressure points for the company on some labor cost due to the fact that we had more vacancies in the first quarter because our volume picked up a little bit more than we anticipated. And we filled some of those in the latter part of the first quarter and that carried into the second quarter.","The other thing I would say, is the company's initiatives that I laid out in our guidance for 2015 ramped up a little bit more in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. So that had a modest impact.","And then the third point is we are seeing some acceleration in drug costs, which have been in the press, it's been in the political arena and so forth. We're feeling that in our pharmaceutical cost trends somewhat and that puts some pressure on our margins in the second quarter.","I'll tell you this, the company is focused on margin enhancements, like it always has been. We're continually trying to find ways to leverage the scale of the organization, use our technology and our data more effectively to identify efficiency opportunities and improvement opportunities. And we continue to believe as we ramp up volume growth, we will be able to leverage the operating costs of the company and create margin expansion. And then when you couple that with our growth initiatives, which are centered on high-margin service expansion, high-margin investments, we think the combination of those two things will continue to put the company in a very solid position with this operating margin.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, A. J. Appreciate it. Move on to the next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho Securities.","Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you very much. This is really an outstanding performance and it's really, in my opinion, a shame that the market is not giving you a little bit more credit for it, especially in view of the volume performance we've seen from everyone else. But that's not a question and this is.","Can you focus a little bit, please, on the increase in the bad debt number? Was that related to what you saw in self-pay and\/or was it related to some consideration of balance after? And do you think that this sort of thing is something we should model in as sustainable? Sorry to ask (28:01).","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Sheryl. Bill will address that.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. Good morning, Sheryl. Let me try to cover that. It's a good question. Let me touch on uninsured volume trends and then relate that into bad debts and uncompensated care because there are a couple of things that we should point out here.","Overall, the second quarter year over trends are a little bit artificially affected by the pending Medicaid activity we saw in our expansion states last year. So recall we had quite a bit of movement going on in both our uninsured and Medicaid categories in the second quarter, where the buildup in pending Medicaid in the first quarter of last year that got cleared out in the second quarter which lowered your uninsured trends when you look at the second quarter alone.","And so let me look at uninsured volumes on a year-to-date basis first just to account for that early period of reform. On a year-to-date basis, as I mentioned in my comments, our uninsured admissions are down 2.4%. We finished full-year 2014 down just over 9%. So, the slowing of uninsured declines is, we believe, largely attributable to the fact we didn't really have any new states other than Indiana expand Medicaid. So these year-over-year trends are beginning to normalize and sunset on us. And by the way, it's pretty much in line with our expectations and what we're seeing in other areas of our volume.","Relative to bad debts, as we talked about before, I think people understand we have a pretty robust charity and uninsured discount policy. And so we think it's best to look at uncompensated care in total because, in any quarter, there can be some movement between bad debt, charity and uninsured discounts. And we saw that in the second quarter because of some of these payer class movements.","Our uncompensated care, as a percentage of revenue adjusted for the uncompensated care was 30.7% in Q2 of 2015; it was 29.0% in Q2 of 2014. So slight growth. But it was 30.3% in Q4 of 2014 and 29.6% in Q1. So it's a manageable level of growth.","On a year-to-date basis, our uncompensated care is 30.1% versus 30.3% as a percentage of revenue. So there's still some improvement on the year-to-date, but we do believe some of those trends are beginning to sunset on us as we see not as much lift on year-over-year of reform.","We do continue to see some growth in deductibles and co-pay amounts. You mentioned this balance after the bill. We feel we've got really strong collection practices. Our collections per account are staying really consistent with where they've historically been, but we are seeing a little bit higher per account liability. And that tends to affect bad debt slightly. But overall, I think we feel pretty strong about what our collection practices are.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sheryl, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just to follow up on that comment, Bill...","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","...and this is probably broader. As we think about healthcare reform, it sounds like the tailwind from the recent implementation of the law is starting to taper off. So as we look out two years to three years, we've heard a lot of investors ask about the air pocket that we could potentially see in 2017, whether it's the Cadillac Tax changes and all that. How do you guys see healthcare reform playing out? And just your outlook without going into guidance over the next three years.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me start and maybe Milton will add in. I kind of see, on a year-over-year basis, the enrollment for this year is really what's driving the growth. And with the increased enrollment, we are seeing increased reform activity.","I think as we saw last year, we saw that level off in second and third quarter, and it picked up again with first quarter with the new enrollment. I think this year within the year, we might begin and see some leveling off. But I think next year's performance will largely be attributable to the enrollment that we might see. We do think there's some kind of key points of the law that may incentivize people to find enrollment. And so I do think there will continue to be some tailwinds in reform, at least for next year. Not so sure longer term we'll have the visibility into that. So...","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Milt, do you want to add?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me just reinforce maybe than add something new, but reinforce Bill's comments around last year, we had some movement from pending Medicaid out of uninsured. And so really we look at the number on a year-to-date basis. We've said that last year in the second quarter comments, and I'd just reinforce that. I think that's important. I don't want to get too alarmed about the particular second quarter growth in uninsured admissions because of that comp to last year.","Also, as I think about reform going forward, I do think we'll continue to see continued growth in enrollment next year with reform. The CEO (33:04), of course, projects that as well. I think you'll see more material \u2013 that the penalty tax will materially increase next year for those who choose not to seek health insurance coverage. And that may drive more enrollment.","And then you're going to see employers with as few as 50 employees having to provide health insurance to their employees to avoid a penalty at the employer level. So there's still some implementation pieces of reform that we've yet to see and so I want to reinforce that out into the market and not react too much to this second quarter because of the comp situation that we had last year.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Brian. Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to Frank Morgan from RBC Capital.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. As I look at your cash flows, strong cash flow trends so far year-to-date, it looks like you beat, actually a little bit ahead of your full-year trend line run rate. I was just wondering if you've got anything we should be considering about what might happen in the second half of the year because I think typically that is your stronger part of the year. Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill, do you want to address that?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think we're still projecting our cash flow from operations to be somewhere between $4 billion and $4.250 billion for full year. And I think we feel pretty good about that number. If you look at kind of a year-to-date, as I said, $2.075 billion, so that does imply a little bit of growth in the second half of the year.","As you said, last year, second half of the year was really strong as we saw the core growth of HCA continue to prosper. There's really no reason to think that shouldn't continue for the second half of this year.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Frank.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thank you. Wanted to just ask, if I could, on the surgeries. You mentioned inpatient surgeries growing faster than outpatient. That's not a normal trend, and I'm wondering if you could comment on that and if you expect that will continue.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Matt, thank you. Sam, you want that one?","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","I was speaking to the volume growth inside of HCA. I think your point about overall demand for outpatient surgery outpacing inpatient demand is probably an accurate statement. We don't get great information with respect to market share data for outpatient surgery, so it's difficult for us to assess our overall performance there. It's clear in a lot of our markets there's are more suppliers of outpatient surgery than there are inpatient surgery, and so that could be part of the dynamic that we're seeing as an organization.","We have, though, changed the trend curve for HCA on outpatient surgeries over the past two years or three years with our Surgical Growth Initiative and our OR of Choice efforts, and we've turned the trend line positive in the face of significant competition.","So I think your statement is right about demand for outpatient surgery. But for HCA, though, I will say a number of our service line initiatives that are intended to drive more acuity, more complexity and round out the offerings within our market, will be centered on certain service lines that have a lot of inpatient surgeries. For example, trauma, cardiovascular, oncology, just to name a few, have a very significant inpatient surgical component which is a very high-margin service line for the company and a very significant service line with respect to rounding out the depth of our service line offerings. So that's part of what's going on in our metrics as well.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Raskin from Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the call. It seems like there's just been a lot going on in hospital land with spin-offs and real estate sales and other M&A. And it seems HCA is clearly focused on capital expenditures. You guys increased your guidance for CapEx last quarter. So I'm curious, could you help us understand just better what the projects are that you guys are investing in? You're spending more than all of your peers combined. And how do you estimate the returns on those capital expenditures?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Sam, do you want to start with that one?","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Well, I think the first thing I would say, the company has incredible cash flow that it has remarkable optionality with being able to use that. And when we think about capital expenditures and we think about the core growth agenda of the company, which is centered around organic growth within its existing markets, it creates a need for capital investment. And so from that standpoint, we have studied our growth trajectory, we've studied our capacity constraints and we've studied our opportunities, if you will, with our strategy, and we felt that the increase in capital expenditures was needed to really resource that particular component of our business in a very significant way.","And you've seen us over the last five years incrementally increase our capital investments as we've come out of the LBO and into the public market as our volume improved, as our market share improved, as the economy has improved, and so that's been a driver for us.","With respect to the components of that, as I've said on my comments and I've said in previous quarters' comments, inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, technology that's needed for our nurses and physicians and then new facilities are really where we're spending our money, which makes sense. That's what we are when it comes to an organic growth-oriented company. So that's where the capital expenditures are going.","Milton or Bill, I don't know if you want to speak to the other components of what's going in the industry.","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me just say that, first of all, I think you talked about some of the returns. We have I think a very sophisticated and effective process to evaluate our capital projects. And so we put them through a really solid process to evaluate the opportunities. And as a management team, the things Sam just talked about, before approving these projects as a team, with Bill and Sam and myself and others, we evaluate these projects. And I can tell you that we just approved a batch in the second quarter of about $550 million of expenditures that all of us went through. And personally, I think they're great investments.","If you look at the returns, I think the average net present value return on that package of improvements is probably somewhere around 2 (40:14), so a very strong return opportunity. If you look at the company's return on invested capital, I don't have it as of June 30, but for the last 12 months ended March 15, our return on invested capital is 16.1%. I can say that the end of 2014 it was 15.2% and the end of 2013 it was 13.9%. So, we're seeing increasing returns on our invested capital.","And if you know this company, we have been an organic growth company now for the last nine years basically. So when you think about the company going private in 2006, we had $4.5 billion roughly of EBITDA and, again, basically the same assets today, nine years later. And if we hit our guidance near the top end of the range of $7.85 billion, you can see the solid growth in earnings through that time.","So I think our processes are effective. I think we have great investment opportunities. We're pursuing those. And I think our returns, especially the recent returns over the last few years, demonstrate that the process is working.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Josh.","Operator","We'll go next to Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. I'd just be curious if you could talk a little bit about the exchange volumes that you're seeing and maybe specifically anything notable in certain geographies, like Florida, that may be perhaps stronger than others.","And we're seeing some of the rehab companies and anesthesiology providers talking about seeing these newly covered patients come through the delivery system now. So just wondering if there's any observation on service lines, access points. Is it still mostly outpatient? That'd be helpful.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Whit. Thank you. I'm going to let Bill take that and I don't know if Sam will have anything to add.","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, let me start on that. A couple quick points on the observations. I don't really have any on service mix. But geographically, I can tell you Florida is our strongest exchange volume state. When we look in the pockets in Florida and I look at the year-over-year growth, Florida is our highest state in terms of growth of exchanges. That's both in South Florida as well as the west coast and spread along even the Panhandle. And we think as we see reports of enrollment in those states and I think the percentage of the population enrolled in Florida is the highest in the country, so with our footprint, I think it just leads that onto that.","Texas is having great exchange and reform volume growth as well, probably just a hair below Florida. So our two largest states are showing the largest reform growth and we think you know that's positive on there. I will tell you our reform trends, as I alluded to briefly earlier, it's starting to level out in March, April, May and June. I look at the monthly numbers. So, we may have found our level for 2016 on there. But as I look at our two largest states, fortunately they're our two largest states with our highest year-over-year reform.","I don't have any update at my fingertips on our mix and intensity. We mentioned last year that our reform business was carrying a little bit higher intensity. That's generally because of the lower OB volume is contained in that population than compared to kind of more commercial population as a whole. My belief is that's continuing on, so it's carrying a little bit more activity.","So, I don't know, Sam, any more commentary on that? I think we're in a good position contract-wise and feel very good about our position from a network configuration perspective as well.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","I think the general statement is this, Whit. The exchange business is very comparable to the commercial business, with the exception of obstetrics being slightly lower, as Bill indicated. Thus, the case mix is slightly greater. So that's the short story on the exchange business as compared to the commercial business.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Whit. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Just coming back to the prior question around CapEx and your growth plans. Because even after subtracting CapEx, we're just trying to think about the uses for your free cash flow after you spend the money to grow internally. Any color you might give on how you going to allocate these funds? Thank you.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Joanna. Thank you. Milton, you want that one?","R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. So, it's really a capital allocation question. And we've been pretty consistent saying that with our free cash flow, we'd look first for acquisition opportunities. It's difficult to project when those will come and how they may or may not materialize. Following that, obviously first investing back in our markets, which we're doing. And then acquisition opportunities and then we've been a consistent buyer of our stock through share repurchase now for quite a while.","As you heard me say in my comments, this year we have already spent $940 million on share repurchase from our February authorization. And, again, we have another just a little bit more than $1 billion remaining on our May 2015 authorization. So pretty consistent by using cash to employ back into the market to acquire our shares. And, again, quite a bit of powder available to us currently.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So any impact worth highlighting related to the Florida LIP changes and the related Medicare provider rate increase in that state? And then kind of related to that, now that you expect to receive the Texas supplemental payment, should we think those payments are likely sustainable in future years, or will we be competing those revenues every year going forward? Thanks.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Andrew. Thank you. Bill?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. I'll try. Really no change in our Florida LIP program. Earlier in the year, the discussion about that program being reduced or eliminated and we've avoided that, so we think year-over-year we're solid in terms of the Florida LIP.","Well, with the Texas Waiver, I think you may know that that Waiver period goes through 9\/30 of 2016. We're in the fourth fiscal year of that and we've got one more year on that. And what happens beyond that Waiver program can't really predict. We know it's hugely important to the providers in the state, so we're hopeful there will be some renewal \u2013 reapplication of the state with CMS. And we'll see how that gets renewed and in what form after the current Waiver period expires. But, again, we're good through 9\/30 of 2016 with that program.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","And, Andrew, I think you'd mentioned the CMS rates. I assume you mean the IPPS Final Rule that came in pretty much as expected. So flattish to moderately up if you look at our total book of business in Medicare for next year.","All right. Next question?","Operator","We'll go to Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have pretty consistently talked about the strength in the economy as being a major driver along with the Affordable Care Act. Some other companies have backed away from being able to differentiate between the benefit from the economy versus healthcare reform. Can you just walk us through your analysis and how you're comfortable that it still is a big driver from the economy and that it's not more healthcare reform?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right, Gary. Sam, Bill, which one of you want to start with that one?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me start and maybe add on. So, Gary, on the reform piece. I agree. I think over time, it will become more and more difficult to distinguish the amount that's truly the reform versus kind of the core business. Today we're still tracking what's going on within the health insurance exchanges and our ability to track that specific volume in that specific population and making some estimates of its impact to the company relative to a pre-reform era.","I do believe as time goes by, and probably sometime in the next year (48:42), it's going to be more and more difficult to attribute the specific amount to reform versus other aspects, whether that be economy or our overall core strategies being executed. But for now, our reform is really being isolated for our health insurance exchange activity.","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Yeah, I think, Gary, from my standpoint, we look at the HCA portfolio of markets as a routine to understand what's the job growth trends, what's the unemployment trends, what's the overall GDP, if you will, of each of HCA's markets. And what we see and what we understand is a very significant improvement in overall macroeconomic factors within each of our markets.","It's hard for me to process that the exchange running, around 2% of our total business, versus the commercial, running around 28% to 30% of our total, that the exchange is driving the overall performance. It's not big enough yet.","And so we believe San Jose, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee, these markets are uniquely growing, and we're seeing an overall commercial demand which is significantly outpacing the ability of the exchange component of our business to drive activity.","And so those are some of the ways we triangulate into understanding how the economy is having an impact. And so that's how we judge it and we believe that to be the case. And we're optimistic that a number of these markets are going to continue to have very strong economic activities in the foreseeable future.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","Gary, thank you. Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning. So you've talked about your contracts and what percentage is in place and so on by segments. Can you give us any color on trends and how that's looking up or down in terms of your negotiations with payers for commercial Medicaid and Medicare?","And then any differences you might be seeing on Medicaid players versus commercial business, considering the rate increases that they're proposing are getting a lot of pushback for the exchange population from the commercial side?","And then finally, on M&A, just all the M&A activity in the payer mix. Do you see your inorganic strategy moving away from maybe new market entry more to shoring up your share in existing markets?","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. So we're going to do managed care contracting, what we're seeing there. And then we're going to step back and look at...","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","Yeah, Vic. This is Sam. There's absolutely no change in our managed care contracting trends as compared to the previous two years or so. Our inflationary adjustments in our commercial contracts are consistent with past trends in the 4% to 5% zone for most of our arrangements.","On the governmental side of our contracting, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid products generally consistent with the states' and the Federal government's change in overall payment rates there. And then the non-pricing terms, as I mentioned in my comments, are fundamentally the same for the most part. There's a few pay-for-performance provisions that we've added here and there to round out our capabilities inside of those contracts, but those are not really inconsistent with past practices.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Bill, do you want to address the M&A activity?","William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, in the managed care space, yes. So, well, first, we need to see the outcome of the DOJ review from an anti-trust standpoint. That could very well affect certain market positions. And our analysis would be a market-by-market approach to understand the HCA impact. So, without having that information, we really can't address the HCA impact.","Second, in many of our markets, pricing among the largest payers are in a fairly tight band today, which, of course, would minimize any short-term impacts. And then, a third, I'll remind you that with respect to HCA, our market position and market share, in most of our markets either we're number one or number two in share in most of our markets, puts us in a good position to be relevant to all the payers going forward. And so my concern more over the longer term is how does this consolidation or possible consolidation affect smaller providers or systems in markets that may only operate in one or two markets.","And to your question about shoring up our share, we look to do that. We're trying to be opportunistic to do that. And the question I would have is could this consolidation be a catalyst for further provider consolidation. And that's yet to be known. We'll see how that plays out. But it could be a catalyst to give us more opportunity for consolidation in the provider space.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Thank you, Ana. Another question?","Operator","And we'll go next to Dana Nentin from Deutsche Bank.","Dana Nentin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the call. Just going back to volumes, you saw some nice strength in areas like behavioral and rehab. Anything specific that's driving that strength, whether it be a function of some of your recent investments? Any color you could provide there.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Sam, do you want to take that one?","Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations","We have had over the past number of years a fairly aggressive effort in both of these service lines to develop capabilities in each of our markets. Both service lines are very complementary to core service lines within HCA. For example, behavioral health is very complementary to our emergency services line. Rehab is very complementary to our orthopedics and neurosciences. So we've been very aggressive over the past number of years in, number one, creating capacity and capability within these two service lines.","And then the second thing we've been able to do is internalize the patient, if you will, inside the HCA network and keep them in the system when they needed those particular service lines. That has yielded a great deal of growth for us and we've had remarkable sustained growth in both service lines.","We still believe we have opportunities in a number of our markets to make larger investments in each of these service lines by adding more capacity, taking advantage of the demand for these two service lines and then creating opportunities to capture more share of patients who hit our system and don't get these particular services within HCA network. So we're very bullish on both of these service lines.","Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President","All right. Dana, thank you. And best I can tell, there's no one left in the queue. And I want to just thank everyone for being on the call. Appreciate it and look forward to seeing you all soon.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
