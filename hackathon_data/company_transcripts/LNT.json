At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan T. Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; as well as other members of the senior management team.","Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy\u2019s year-end and fourth quarter 2014 earnings and affirmed 2015 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call, are available on the Investor Page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy\u2019s press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning and thank you for joining us on our year-end earnings call. I will begin with an overview of 2014 performance and show our progress on our capital expenditures including the generation fleet transformation to clean air more efficient energy sources. I will then turn the call over to Tom to walk through our 2014 results and our 2015 guidance.","I am pleased to report we\u2019ve had another solid year. I want to thank our dedicated and talented employees for achieving our goals and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and financial performance.","Our 2014 weather normalized earnings are in line with the midpoint of our original earnings guidance issued in November of 2013 and reflected an 8% increase from 2013 as you can see on Slide 2. Through creative and constructive rate making in Iowa and Wisconsin our earnings growth was achieved with a minimal impact on customer rates.","Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2014 was certainly one of the most active construction years in our company history with almost $1 billion deployed into the business. We invested over $335 million in our electric and gas energy delivery systems in 2014 to continue to make our systems more resilient, meet customer growth and to bring natural gas service to communities which did not have access before.","We also made significant progress transitioning the environmental profile of our coal generation fleet. Installing mission controls at our Tier 1 coal fired facilities increasing levels of natural gas fired generation and increasing levels of renewable energy result in significant environmental benefits.","As a result of these efforts, SO2 and Nox are expected to be reduced by at least 90% and 80% respectively from 2005 levels to 2025. Mercury emissions are expected to decline over 90% from 2009 to levels in 2025. In fact, a majority of these environmental improvements are currently in place. In Wisconsin we completed construction of the baghouses and scrubbers at Columbia Units 1 and 2.","The emission reductions have exceeded contractual guarantees and the overall project came in on time and approximately 6% below budget. WP&L share of the capital expenditures for this project was approximately $275 million. We expect to start construction on the recently approved Columbia Unit 2 SCR later this year. The installation of our scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 is in progress. And we expect to place that project in service in the second quarter of 2016.","Capital expenditures forecasted for this project are approximately $300 million. In Iowa the scrubber and baghouse at our Ottumwa facility is complete. Again the project was completed on time and slightly below budget. IPL share of the capital expenditure was approximately $160 million. At our Lansing Generating Station the scrubber project is progressing on schedule and the tie in goal is planned for the spring. The estimated capital expenditure for this project is approximately $55 million.","In addition to the progress we\u2019re making on transforming our Tier 1 units we prepared our Tier 2 units to be compliant with the Utility Mercury and Air Toxic Standards or UMATS by this April. We installed low cost emission control equipment at Burlington, Edgewater Unit 4, and Prairie Creek and are well positioned to be in UMATS compliance at these units.","At Nelson Dewey and Edgewater 3 we already received a one-year extension to keep them on coal. We are planning to convert CAP to run on natural gas but have requested an extension to allow burning coal until MISO has approved the conversion. New procedures have been implemented and our facilities are prepared to meet the UMATS compliance reporting requirements.","Site construction is well underway at IPLs combined-cycle natural gas-fired Marshalltown Generating Station. KBR is the engineering procurement and construction contractor for this project and Sumas is providing the combustion turbine technology. The gas pipeline to the facility is planned to be built later this year and we are working with ITC on the transmission upgrades necessary to support the project. Marshalltown is expected to be in the service in the second quarter of 2017.","Late last year WP&L unveiled a proposal to expand the Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This expansion advances our strategy for implementing environmentally responsible resources and provides for continuing investment in a region where our company has served customers for almost 100 years. We've already started a series of public informational meetings and are pleased with the level of interest in the proposal.","Earlier this month, we filed an engineering plan with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine the environmental permits and approvals required for this project. Within the next couple of months, we expect to submit a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or the CPCN to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. In analyzing the need for the WPL resource, we followed the same process we use prior to filing our applications for the construction of Marshalltown and for the purchase of the existing Riverside Units.","The process included issuing an RFP to determine what alternatives are available which were all evaluated by a third-party. We also included as options the conversion of existing simple-cycle facilities and construction of a new facility. Our analysis concluded that the construction of a new combined-cycle gas facility would be in the best interest of our customers and the evaluation will be fully described in our PSCW application.","The proposed Riverside Energy Center expansion is an approximate 650 megawatt high efficiency natural gas generation resource at an estimated cost between $725 million and $775 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. This facility is similar to our Marshalltown Generating Station and it will replace approximately 700 megawatts of capacity which we expect to retire in the coming years including Nelson Dewey, Edgewater Units 3 and 4 and various peaking units.","With plant closures we are striving to creatively reuse sites in ways that have a positive impact on the community and our customers. For example, we are working with the Beloit College was planning to repurpose the Blackhawk Generating Station into a student recreation center.","We are also soliciting interest and repurposing our Nelson Dewey station which has great rail and barge access and it is located on the Mississippi River. And we started demolishing our Sixth Street Generating Station located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and we are working with the city and community groups to determine the best use of that site.","And this year we plan to expand our energy sources to include both purchase and company owned solar generation. We plan to own or operate the solar panels at the Indian Creek nature Center in Iowa and plan to explore solar installation at the Riverside energy center expansion in Wisconsin. These as well as a few other opportunities we are reviewing will help us understand the most efficient way to incorporate solar into our portfolio. The projects that I mentioned require the capital expenditure guidance we provided in November.","As you can tell from all these activities, we are focused on building a bright future for our customers and our company. In addition to our generation transformation, we're transforming customer service operations with new systems that will allow us to better communicate and be more flexible and how we serve customers.","And we are very encouraged in supporting our communities through economic development, employee volunteerism and charitable giving not only from our generous employees, but also through our foundation, donations and grants. And all this has and will be accomplished by our talented employees. And we continue to work closely with the IBEW to provide safe, reliable energy to our customers and to help our communities drive.","Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2014 and are well positioned to deliver on our financial and operating objectives again in 2015. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target increasing our targeted 2015 divided by 8% over the 2014 divided.","We will continue to work with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups and customers and a transparent manner. We will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","Thank you for your interest and I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We released year-end earnings last evening earnings from continuing operations of $3.48 per share. 2014 earnings are higher than 2013 primarily due to lower capacity charges related to IPLs Duane Arnold and WP&Ls Kewaunee Purchase Power Agreements. These positive earnings drivers were partially offset by retail electric customer billings at IPL, higher energy efficiency cost amortizations to WPL, lower electric and gas sales attributed weather and higher depreciation expense.","Also as we communicated last year, we accelerated some generation, distribution and customer service operations and maintenance expense into 2014, which was also an offset earnings. Comparisons between 2014 and 2013 earnings per share are detailed on Slide 3, 4 and 5. We estimate that 2014 weather impact when compared to normal temperatures resulted in higher earnings in $0.09 per share.","This was $0.08 lower than 2013 impact of a positive $0.17 per share. We saw modest weather and normalized retail sales growth in 2014. Sales trends between 2014 and 2013 are illustrated on Slide 6. The extreme weather volatility over the last several years has increase the difficulty in estimating weather impacts.","Now lets review our 2015 earnings guidance. Last quarter we issued our consolidated 2015 earnings per share guidance range of $3.45 to $3.75. Our IPL and WPL retail rate settlements provide increase certainty for customers and allows us an opportunity to earned on an increasing rate base without the inherent uncertainty of traditional rate cases through 2016. The walk from 2014 earnings per share to the midpoint of 2015 estimated earnings guidance range it shown at Slide 7.","The pension expense impacts change from the walk presented in November based on the 2014 year-end discount rate and new mortality tables. Also the tax impacts have changed due to additional 2014 flow through benefits at IPL then originally forecasted. The 2015 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail sales increases of approximately 1% for IPL and 2% for WP&L when compared to 2014.","We are forecasting residential sales increases of less than 1% between 2014 and 2015 for both IPL and WPL. The IPL electric rate settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from placing the Ottumwa projects in service at the end of 2014. The increase in revenue requirements related to these rate based addition is offset by the elimination of Duane Arnold Purchase Power capacity payments.","In 2015, IPL will credit customer bills by approxmiatley $25 million. For modeling purpose assume the $25 million will occur ratably over 2015 by comparison the billing credits in 2014 we are approximately $70 million an occurred from May through December.","The WP&L electric rate settlement reflected base rate increases for major projects at Columbia and Edgewater Unit 5. The 2015 revenue requirements increase for these and another rate base additions was completely offset by a reduction in energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations. Also included in the WP&L settlement was an increase in transmission costs primarily due to the anticipated allocation of SSR costs from the Presque Isle plant located in upper Michigan.","Subsequent to the settlement FERC issued an order requiring MISO to change how it allocates those SSR expenses. As a result the amount of the transmission costs build to WP&L in 2015 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement. Since the PSC also approved escrow accounting treatment of transmission costs, WP&Ls income statement will reflect transmission expenses based on what was reflected in the settlement.","The difference between the actual transmission costs build to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement will accumulate in a regulatory liability with no impact to earnings to 2015. The amount accumulated in this regulatory liability will be another mechanism to be used to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin customers. During 2015, IPL will provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $72 million. In comparison the 2014 tax benefit rider billing credits were $82 million.","The actual earnings impact of the 2014 tax benefit riders as well as the projected quarterly earnings impact of the 2015 tax benefit rider is provided on Slide 8. As in prior years the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated to impact full-year 2015 results.","In our ongoing management of customer bills we have elected to pursue two additional tax accounting method changes for IPL. These accounting changes will accumulate benefits in a regulatory liability which will then be passed through to customers as billing credits. IPLs unique flow through tax accounting convention allows for this treatment. The first accounting change relates to current deduction of certain repair expenditures of electric generation assets for tax purposes.","The second accounting change is due to the tax treatment of the cost retrievable expenditures related to the partial disposition of assets. The total expected billing credits to customers from these two tax accounting method changes is approximately $75 million and is subject to final IRS and IUB approval.","We have proposed to refund this second tax benefit rider after 2016 which is when the regulatory liability related to the first tax benefit rider is expected to be fully utilized. The difference between the statutory tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC and the actual and forecasted effective tax rates for 2014 and 2015 is provided on Slide 9. As noted on the slide the consolidated AEC effective tax is forecasted to increase to 17% from 10%.","The difference in the effective tax rates are primarily due to higher pretax income and lower tax benefits at IPL in 2015. The higher pretax book income is primarily due to lower IPL billing credits. The lower tax benefits are due to lower tax benefit rate of credits and expected reductions in flow through tax benefits at IPL.","Turning to our 2015 financing plan, cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given earnings generated by the business. We will also benefit given we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments or pension contributions in 2015. These strong cash flows will be partially reduced by credits to customer bills in accordance with IPLs tax benefit riders and IPLs customer billing credits resulting from the rate settlement.","In the 2015 financing plan we anticipate issuing approximately $150 million of new common equity through our shareowner direct plan and likely and at the market offering or a dribble out program. We switched the shareowner direct plan to original issue earlier this month.","The 2015, plan also anticipate issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt at IPL with the $150 million to proceeds used to refinance a debt maturity. The plan also assumes that the sale of our Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets will be completed by mid-2015 with proceeds of approximately $140 million before customary closing adjustments.","We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan we will maintain the appropriate targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. The bonus depreciation extension for certain operating expenditures incurred through incurred through December 31, 2014 is not expected to have an impact on our 2015 equity needs.","We expect a positive cash impact of approximately $90 million which will not be realized until 2017 due to our NOL carry forward position. The bonus depreciation does result in a combined IPL and WP&L rate based reduction of approximately $40 million in 2017. This rate base impact was not reflected in the rate based information provided in our investor relation presentation at the November EEI nor in the December Barclays conference presentation.","Now turning to our transmission ROE complaint at MISO. FERC has initiated a formal hearing procedure to address the compliant and is an expected to issue its decision later this year. As we\u2019ve stated previously we believe the impact of the FERC decision could reduce our annual equity earnings from our [AT co-investment] between $0.01 to $0.03 per share. We have include an estimate of this potential reduction in our 2015 earnings guidance.","In addition, the impact of any ROE reduction on transmission expenses will be passed on to our electric customers at IPL and WP&L. We summarized our plan regulatory dockets of note in 2015 on Slide 10. We anticipate a decision from the IUB on the IPL emission plan and budget and the Minnesota electric distribution sale by mid-year.","In Minnesota we anticipate closing the electric and gas distribution sales by mid-year. In Wisconsin, we plan to file an application for a CPCN to construct the proposed approximately 650 megawatt Riverside expansion. We anticipate the PSCW issuing order by mid 2016 for this project. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with throughout the year.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hanson. At this time, the company will open up the call to questions for members of the investment community. Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions].","And we\u2019ll go to Brian Russo with Ladenburg.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, Brian.","Brian J. Russo","Just curious, the outlook for weather normalized sales in both jurisdictions is that kind of tracking what's kind of embedded in the settlements?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes.","Brian J. Russo","Okay. And can you quantify the SSR amount that's going to be refunded to customers?","Thomas L. Hanson","We don\u2019t have a specific amount yet Brian. I would not expect it to be a significant amount, but as I said it\u2019s going to be hung up with the balance sheet and it will be available then for refund with the next rate case.","Brian J. Russo","Okay.","Patricia L. Kampling","Brian, this is Pat. We will give you more transparency in that number now that the SSR costs are being little more finalized, so the next time we meet we\u2019ll have a little more transparency on that.","Brian J. Russo","Okay, great. And then you guys have done a good job of finding customer benefits and refunds. I am just curious as you look towards the next rate case filing at IPL. Do you anticipate additional offsets to the rate increase?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, the $75 million of the additional tax benefit rider that we are proposing at this point Brian will be really used for that purpose.","Brian J. Russo","Okay, great. And then lastly, just remind us of the allowed ROE in both jurisdictions and then how the sharing bans work?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes, in Iowa its about a 10% allowed ROE when you consider the fact that we got 577 treatment in some of the items. In Wisconsin its 10, 4 and the sharing mechanism is that - when earnings get to 10, 6, 5 there is a sharing mechanism and it\u2019s 50% from 10, 6, 5, to 11, 4 and then after 11, 4 it\u2019s a 100% dedicated to rate pairs.","Brian J. Russo","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Patricia L. Kampling","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, everyone, good morning.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","First, just quick one on the cash flows, it sounds like there was no change to the debt or equity plans for 2015, when I look at the bridge for the EPS guidance. Well, it looks like there were a couple of pennies of smaller drags, what\u2019s causing that?","Thomas L. Hanson","Well, from a cash flow there is no substantive changes. And in terms of the earnings we just \u2013 with the November guidance we had an estimate for fourth quarter. Now that we got the benefit of actual, we've gone back and adjusted a couple of those line items. Nothing is significant, but hopefully it will just allow you to monitor our progress over 2015 with actual now that we've got those completed.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. That makes sense. Okay, then a couple follow-up questions on your comments on the solar opportunity that you talked about, can you maybe just elaborate a bit on you mentioned that it's included in the CapEx forecast you gave in November, but would that be in the first five years or the second five-year buckets, would that be instead of some of the win you\u2019ve been looking into or in addition, and lastly would you depend on the EPA's Carbon rule or is this more of an economic opportunity?","Patricia L. Kampling","Okay, that\u2019s a lot of questions. The credits we're looking at right now are not huge. So there are millions of dollars, not tens of millions of dollars. So they are just in the general capital guidance even for 2015 and 2016. We haven\u2019t really looked at solar beyond the next couple of years right now. We want to make sure we understand how it integrates well into the grid and that's why we're taking these steps right now to learn on these projects. And it's really independent of what happens on the EPA plan at this point.","Andrew Weisel","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Patricia L. Kampling","And it doesn\u2019t change any of our capital guidance that we provided.","Andrew Weisel","Got it.","Operator","And we will go to our next question Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve I. Fleishman","Hi, good morning","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, Steve.","Steve I. Fleishman","Hi, Pat. So it sounds like you are taking a reserve in your guidance for the ATC ROE outcome in the MISO review? Could you just is this something like it sounds like so you have to do or you are just kind of choosing to do that to be cautious and how are you setting this reserve?","Patricia L. Kampling","Well, I\u2019ll say is that since it is probable that ROEs will probably be changing the transmission world. We did take a reserve and however for us it\u2019s really immaterial, we are not been very specific about the targeted ROEs at this point, but we did take a slight reserve.","Steve I. Fleishman","Okay. And then just when would you need to be kind of going back to working on kind of the next rate deals I guess both go through 2016, or is it something you have to start working on basically beginning of next year?","Patricia L. Kampling","We are actually working on them right now. We do multiyear capital planning, so as we develop our plans we want to make sure these rate cases are very solid and we can smoothen any rate increases as necessary and as we talked about the Dewey, we got the TBR dollars to be used and then in Wisconsin we are going to have some additional dollars that are in escrow that we can use. So we are working on that right now, putting our plans together, we don\u2019t need to file them all until Wisconsin is 2016, and Iowa be early 2017, but the planning has already started.","Steve I. Fleishman","Okay. Great, thank you very much.","Patricia L. Kampling","Thanks Steve.","End of Q&A","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan T.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different.","Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","I addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures.  The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides which are available on our website at www.aliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Good morning and thank you for joining us today.  First, on behalf of all the employees at Alliant Energy, I'd like to offer our encouragement and support for those of you impacted by hurricane Sandy.  We hope that you, your families and your businesses are on a path to recovery and with you all the very best.","I must recognize the over 200 dedicated Alliant Energy employees who have been working in New York.  I also want to thank them and their families for the personal sacrifices they have made to help those in need.","And to many of you on the call, our employees certainly appreciate the gratitude and encouragement you've shown our crews as you've seen them in your neighborhood.  However, a very special thanks go to our employees who are maintaining the excellent customer service and liability here at home while our crews are away.","I couldn't be prouder of the compassion, work ethic and dedicated of our entire organization.  And speaking of dedication, with Veteran's Day just a few days away, I would also like to take a moment and pay tribute to the 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today.","This morning, we issued a press release that provided third quarter results, revised 2012 earnings guidance, a slight revision to the capital expenditures for 2012 through 2016 and earnings guidance and a targeted dividend level to 2013.","Tom will provide the detail on the quarterly financial results and year-end 2012 and 2013 projections.  But in summary, I am pleased to let you know that for 2012, the midpoint o the guidance increased by $0.07, the targeted 2013 dividend level is 4.5% above current levels and adjusting 2012 for weather impacts, the 2013 midpoint of guidance is 10% above expected 2012 results.","This is consistent with our 5% to 7% weather normalized long-term earnings growth goals and targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 70% of earnings.","Supplemental Slide 2 provides the comparison to our current 2012 and 2013 guidance midpoints.  The 2012 guidance on this page includes the $0.14 of weather benefits, therefore, is not weather normalized.","Much of the focus over the last year has been on IPO's regulatory strategy for the orderly transition of our generating fleet with the objective of managing total customer costs.  Our regulatory strategy is impacted by a number of key initiatives, including the 2013 expiration of our Iowa retail electric based rate freeze for post extension of the DACPPA, several initial control investments, the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station and the disposition of the remaining electric tax benefit writer funds.","Our objective is to continue to pursue a solution with Iowa stakeholders to stabilize retail electric base rates until the Marshalltown generating station is in service in 2017.","This objective is achievable since we expect that the decline in revenue requirements related to the DAC capacity payments will be offset by increase I cost of service and rate base through 2016.","Approximately three months ago, IPL (inaudible) to the DAC sale docket to request approval from the IUB, an 11 year extension of the PPA and recovery of new charters through the energy adjustment clause.","The hearing on this matter will be held in December and we are expecting a decision on this filing in 2013.  Currently, $135 million is expected in Iowa retail electric base rates for the DAC capacity payment.","The current purchase power agreement ends in February 2014 and that year's capacity payment totals $28 million.  IN the event a base rate settlement is not reached for years 2014 to 2016, we are prepared to file a test year 2013 retail electric rate case in early 2014.","We would expect the 2013 rate base and that portion of the 2014 rate base addition that occurred prior to the filing date to be included in interim rates.  A majority of the 2014 rate base would be included in final rates.","Supplemental Slide 3 shows a projected IPO rate base for 2013 through 2015.  As you can see from the slide, rate base is expected to grow from the time of the rate freeze until 2014 at over 20% or $600 million.","The projected 2014 rate base does include the (kneel) three and four (inaudible) mission controls projects.","Later this month, we plan to file an application wit the Iowa utilities board for advanced rate making principles and site approval for the Marshalltown generating station.  Our proposed advanced rate making principles included fixed costs after $700 million excluding (AFEDC) and transmission upgrades for a return on common equity of 11.25% and no double leverage penalty.","(Inaudible) to the filing and the expected regulatory approval schedule are included in supplemental Slide 4.","We expect the decision from the IUB approximately 12 months after filing.  We anticipate the Marshalltown generating station by itself would increase customer rates approximately 7% in 2017 and another 3% in 2018.  This assumes an April 2017 in service date.","The electric tax benefit writer will continue to be used to mitigate overall customer cost at IPL.  There is still approximately $250 million remaining to be refunded back to customers starting in 2013.  We will work with stakeholders to develop an appropriate refund plan to best stabilize rates.","Next, let me quickly brief you on all of our construction activities.  We currently have over 500 contract workers on the property assisting with all our projects.  The construction of the scrubber and (back half) at our (Tummer) facility is transitioning from foundation work to steel erection and this project is expected to be in service in 2014.","In addition, (Mid America) is currently installing (bag houses) and scrubbers new units three and four.  A portion of these projects will be going into service in 2013 and remain through 2014.","In Wisconsin, construction of the Edgewater 5 SCR and Columbia units one and two (bag house) and scrubber is well underway.  We are pleased to report that the Edge 5 SCR tie and outage is complete within budget and performance testing has begun.  The controls are expected to be in service by the end of this year.","Steel work is underway at Columbia and the project is expected to be in service in the first half of 2014.  Both of these projects were factored into the WPL retail investor grade settlement for 2013 and 2014.","In July, we filed the construction authorization request with the PSCW for a scrubber and (bag house) at Edgewater 5.  We expect approval in mid 2013 and construction will be approximately $410 million project is expected to begin in 2014 and be completed in 2016.","By the end of this year, we will be adding two generating facilities to our fleet, which are the Riverside Energy Center and our unregulated Franklin County Wind Farm.","All regulatory approvals are now in hand for WPL's $395 million purchase of the Riverside Energy Center.  With the addition of the 95 megawatts of capacity at Edgewater Unit 5 and the incremental 100 megawatts of capacity upon the purchase of Riverside, WPL has almost fully replaced the capacity that will be lost in the 2013 expiration of the (Kuwana) PPA.","(Dominion)'s plan to shut down (Kuwana) in the middle of 2013 is not expected to have a material impact on WPL.  The contract terms will remain in effect through the end of 2013.","At the Franklin County Wind Farm, I am pleased to report that construction is substantially complete and over one-third of the megawatts have been commissioned and are in test mode.  The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $235 million, excluding capitalized interest cost.","Since this project is schedule to be in service by year-end, it will allow us to elect a cash grant option.  We continue to seek and all-take contract for the facility but in the mean time we will be selling this power into the my sell market.","Our 2012 through 2016 capital expenditure plan has been updated slightly to reflect current timelines for all of our construction projects.  Our new detailed capital expenditure plan is provided in the earnings release we issued this morning and the WPL, IPL split of these expenditures will provided in the third quarter 10-Q filing, which will be submitted to the SEC today.","Before handing off to Tom, I am pleased to inform you that we have signed a letter of intent on the sell of RMT.  We are currently working on the final details of the sale and expect to close in December.","Let me summarize the key messages for today.  We continue to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% dividend payout target.  We've increased the midpoint and now with the range of 2012 earnings guidance, provided earnings and divided guidance for 2013.","We are making great progress on transforming our generating portfolio to one that is balanced with lower emissions and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations.  We are focused on working safely, providing excellent customer service and improving reliability.","And finally, we will manage our company focusing on operational and financial discipline with the goal of earning our authorized returns while minimizing customer rate increases.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, everyone.  We released third quarter earnings this morning with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations went down to $0.34 per share.  There are no adjustments to GAAP earnings this quarter.","2012 third quarter earnings are up over third quarter 2011 primarily due to the impacts of warmer weather and the timing of the electric tax benefit writer.  These positive EPS drivers were personally offset by expected increases in depreciation and new purchase power capacity expenses.","Comparisons between third quarter 2012 and 2011 earnings per share are detailed on supplemental Slides 5, 6 and 7.  The third quarter 2012 weather resulted in positive earnings on electric sales of $0.20 per share, $0.04 higher than third quarter 2011 weather impact of $0.16 per share.","Year to date, weather increased earnings $0.14 in 2012.  With the higher earnings from the summer weather, we are planning to incur some additional expenses in the fourth quarter to get a head start on some key operational initiatives.","These initiatives include tree trimming, providing our field and plant employees with flame retardant pants and enhancing our business continuity planning.  As a result of the earnings impacts of the weather and these initiatives, we narrowed the 2012 earnings guidance range to $2.90 to $3.05 per share.","As a reminder, our 2012 guidance was based on no material growth in weather normalized sales between 2011 and 2012 and that is still our forecast for this year as well as next year.","Sales trends are illustrated on supplemental Slide 8 and 9.  The electric tax benefit writer resulted in quarter-over-quarter variation in IPL and (apparent) of $0.04 per share of higher earnings in the third quarter of 2012 when compared to the third quarter of 2011.","The actual and projected quarterly earnings impact on the 2012 as well as the actual quarterly impact on the 2011 electric tax benefit writer was provided in the earnings release issued this morning.","As demonstrated in the earnings release, the electric tax benefit writer quarterly timing issue is not anticipated to impact full-year 2012 results.  The walk from the 2011 to 2012 projected effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC is provided on supplemental Slide 10.","Turning to our financing plan, we believe that with our strong cash flow and financing plan we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics.  Our current financing plan anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $375 million in the third \u2013 in the fourth quarter of 2012 including up to $300 million for the acquisition of Riverside.","During the third quarter of this year, our service company issued $75 million of debt to finance the acquisition of our corporate headquarters building and general working capital.  We do not plan on issuing any material new common equity through 2013.","We will continue to assess our future equity needs based on the regulatory approvals received for the various large capital spending projects that we are proposing and also based on our ongoing assessment of evolving market conditions.","Cash flows from operations are expected to stay strong since we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2015.  These cash flows will be partially offset with credits to customer builds in accordance with IPL's tax benefit writer.","Now, let's review our 2013 guidance.  This morning we issued our consolidated 2013 guidance range of $2.95 to $3.25 per share.  A walk from the midpoint of the 2012 to the 2013 estimated guidance ranges is shown on supplemental Slide 11.","Starting with utilities, the 2013 guidance assumes normal weather and is based upon the impacts of WPL's previously announced electric retail rate freeze and gas rate decrease and IPL's proposed settlement of its gas rate case.","The WPL rate case reflected electric rate-based growth as a result of the Riverside acquisition and placing the Edgewater 5 SCR in service at the end of 2012.  The increase in electric revenue requirement for 2013 from these rate-based additions was completely offset by the impact of lower purchase power capacity cost from the Riverside PPA and the lower conservation expense resulting in no change to WPL's retail electric customers base rate in 2013.","Despite no change in WPL's electric customers base rates, WPL expects to increase earnings from the reduction in purchase power capacity and conservation costs.  The 2013 guidance also reflect a decrease in earnings from the $13 million annual reduction in WPL's gas base rates effective January 1, 2013.","Our 2013 guidance range forecast that WPL is expected to earn close to its authorized return of equity of 10.4% and we expect to infuse $100 million of equity from the parent into IPL later this year for the Riverside acquisition.","Now, turning to IPL, IPL is forecasted to benefit from the increase in electric revenues from a revenue requirement adjustment proposed with the finalization of the amounts for its electric tax benefit writer, higher ACDC from is environmental control projects currently under construction and lower income tax expense from certain tax projects.","These benefits are expected to be partially offset by higher DACPPA capacity costs as well as higher depreciation expense in 2013 when compared to 2012.","Our 2013 guidance range forecast, that IPL is expected to earn slightly below its authorized average return on equity of approximately 10%.","The revenue requirement adjustment proposed for 2013 is based upon three tax projects which were initiated prior to IPL's 2009 test year retail electric rate case which led to the establishment of the electric tax benefit writer.","These projects were the allocation of flood insurer's proceeds, the allocation of mixed service cost and the deduction of additional repair expenditures.  If we had followed traditional Iowa rate making practices in IPL's last electric rate case, these projects would have changed customer rates by reducing tax expenses and increasing rate base.","Due to the materiality and uncertainty of these projects, the IUB issued an account order in 2010 to temporarily suspend the traditional Iowa rate making practices and not reflect these projects in rates until IRS certainty was reached.","We have now reached agreement with the IRS on the benefits of these three projects through the 2011 tax year.  With certainty achieved, IPL's proposing to finalize the reconciliation of rate impacts for these three projects to reflect traditional Iowa rate making practices in two ways.","First, the reduction of tax expense will be updated to reflect the final amount of billing credits available to electric customers based on IRS audit results.  Second, the increase to electric rate base will be proposed as an adjustment to the billing credits, which is expected to result in $0.13 of additional revenues in 2013 as illustrated on supplemental Slide 12.","This proposal has been reflected in the 2013 tax benefit writer filing, which is expected to be made with the IUB in November 2012.  Given the changes expected in the income tax for 2013, supplemental Slide 13 has been provided to assist you with modeling our forecasted 2013 effective tax rates at IPL, WPL and AEC.","Finally, with respect to our guidance, we turn to the projections for the parent and non-regulated businesses.  We forecast that the transportation business remains steady, earnings per share between $0.11 to $0.13.","The parent will continue paying interest on $250 million of debt at an interest rate of 4%.  The Franklin County Wind Farm will be fully operational by the end of 2012.  We are still investigating off take options for this facility.","Our 2013 guidance assumes this facility will operate as a merchant generator in 2013 at an estimated $0.04 loss.  The loss, primarily due to lower expected short-term electricity prices as well as interest and depreciation expenses that begin with the start of operations.","The forecasted weather normalized EPS growth from the midpoint of 2012 earnings guidance to the midpoint of 2013 earnings guidance is 10%.  This growth contributes to our forecasted long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% based upon weather normalized 2010 earnings of $2.62 per share.","Turning to our regulatory calendar, we have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for the rest of 2012 and for the first quarter of 2013 which are summarized on Slide 14.","In December, the IUB has two scheduled hearings relating to IPL filings.  The first is for the Iowa gas case.  In August of this year, a settlement agreement was filed with the IUB which contains an annual $11 million gas increase.","As part of this settlement, we propose to use a temporary gas tax benefit writer of approximately $36 million to minimize the impact to customer rates.  This amount is expected to be spread over a three-year period.","The second hearing in December will address our request for approval of the new DACPPA which would start in February 2014.","We are expecting four decisions from the IUB during the first quarter 2013.  The first relates decisions concerning the emission plan and budget filings submitted by IPL and (Mid-American) in April 2012.  IPL and (Mid-American) recently filed settlements reached with the OCA for the emission control projects at (George Neal), (Otamwa) and (Lancing) generating facilities.","The second decision is regarding our proposal to change the Iowa energy adjustment rules to include costs or credits resulting from future EPA rule changes, emission control chemicals and renewable energy credit revenues as well as an option to include production tax credits.","The third is a decision on the November filing to the 2013 retail electric tax benefit writer credits and related revenue requirement adjustment for 2013 being proposed.  And the fourth is the transmission cost factor for 2013.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you at EEI.  The slides to be discussed at EEI will be posted on our website later today.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Tom, quick question, the contract cancellation that you have in the quarter-over-quarter walk, I assume that's Riverside.  Can you confirm what that is?","Tom Hanson","No, that is a long-term service agreement at (Emry) that we're stepping out of.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","So that's almost a non-recurrer.  That's something that we won't see again.","Tom Hanson","That is correct.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","And then, Pat, on the Franklin County plant, I noted that we're now looking for a loss and certainly a contract could potentially mitigate that.  But how do you think about sale opportunities of that asset?  Obviously an unregulated wind is probably not core to what you're trying to accomplish.","Pat Kampling","Jay, we went down this path.  We knew this was the least risky option for us was just to complete the site before the tax credits expire.  We're still open to many different ideas on what to do with the facility.","Right now, we're just willing to ride the my sell market even though the costs are lower just because of the long-term pricing of PPAs right now.  So we're definitely open for all types of options on that as we go forward.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","And that $0.04 reflects current market environment.","Pat Kampling","Yes, yes.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Then on the Iowa rate base that you included in the supplemental slides, does that include quip or not include quip?","Tom Hanson","It does not include quip.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Given the changes in the CapEx \u2013 I know it was only about $50 million net across the 2012 to 2016 \u2013 would the quip balances change a lot from what you had previously disclosed appreciating that they'll likely be included in the slides that you published this afternoon?","Tom Hanson","No, no.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","I apologize because I got on the call a little bit late.  The Iowa rate proposal, has that been filed yet or should we expect that shortly?","Tom Hanson","That will be filed here in November.  Well, I should say probably at the end of November.","Pat Kampling","Are you talking about the Marshalltown generating station, Brian?","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","No, I'm referring to a proposed rate structure in 2014.","Pat Kampling","No, that has not been filed.  We are still working with the stakeholders to find an appropriate method to come up with the rate stabilization plan.  We can talk to you when we see you at the EEI over the weekend.  But you'll see in the slides that we posted the rate base additions will be really offsetting the reduction in the capacity payment.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","Just to clarify, the rate base numbers for IPL in the current slides that's after any deferred tax adjustment, correct?","Pat Kampling","That's true, yes.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","Then just on the rate stabilization plan, I think you said earlier the goal is to keep rates where they are and backfill it with CapEx.  Would you be in a position of overearning in 2014 and, therefore, you might look to implement some sort of ROE sharing band?","Pat Kampling","That's definitely open.  The overearning, though, is not going to be very meaningful, Brian, as you look at the additional rate base that's been \u2013 will be added to IPL.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","And if I heard you correctly, if you don't reach a rate stabilization plan settlement you'll file in '13 in IPL for rates in '14 and also include 2014 rate base in that.","Pat Kampling","Yes, what we'll do, Brian, is file at the end of the first quarter in '14, which is really the '13 rate base.  But you can also file for first quarter additions to rate base, so it will be a hybrid of '13 plus the first quarter additions to '14 that we'll file if we have to go down that path.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","Then on the 2013 guidance, I noticed this $0.11 year-over-year positive for higher PTCs and change in tax accounting that's related to property.  Could you just add some background on that?","Tom Hanson","Yes, with respect to the higher PPCs, we would expect there would be additional generation from the (Ben Tree) project and, to a lesser degree, at Whispering Willow East and then the tax method change that we're proposing is that this would allow us to take an immediate deduction for cost removal items in IPL service territory which would then allow us to capture the benefit that we have highlighted on Slide 11.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","Is that ongoing?","Tom Hanson","Yes.  That would be a change in method on a going forward basis.  So we would continue to see some continuation of that benefit in future years.","Brian Russo \u2013 Landenburg Thalmann","And then what's the load growth assumption in '13 versus '12?","Tom Hanson","In the supplemental slides, we have identified that but the reality is it's virtually flat.  We have a slide that shows '11 to '12 and then '12 to '13 but for all intensive purposes it's flat.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

Please go ahead.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.","With me today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Hanson, Vice President and CFO, as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy\u2019s first quarter 2012 earnings. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements.

We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in supplemental slides, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Good morning. Thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter 2012 results. It is no surprise that our first quarter financial performance was negatively impacted by the warm weather. However, we plan to manage our spending during the rest of this year to lessen the impact.","With the exception of the weather, our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance was inline with our expectations, just like last year the tax benefit rider cost adjustments this quarter but is not expected to have an impact on full year results.","Yesterday, we filed a proposal in Wisconsin to freeze electric retail base rates for 2013 and 2014, and to reduce gas retail base rates for 2013 carrying through 2014. This proposal is a result of our collaboration with commission staff and major intervener groups. The proposal is consistent with our plans to minimize rate increases while allowing us to earn authorized return. Tom will provide more detail on these matters in a few minutes.","An important item to share with you today is that we have decided to continue with PTCs for Whispering Willow and the Bent Tree utility Wind Farm instead of the cash grant option. We believe that with our strong cash flow, we can maintain adequate liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics.","Therefore, we do not plan on any -- on issuing any material new common equity through 2013. We will assess our future equity needs after we receive regulatory approvals on the large projects we will propose later this year.","Let me now brief you on some of our current activities. It has been and will continue to be a very active and productive year as we continue to focus on transforming and balancing our generating fleet.","Our plans include retrofitting our Tier 1 coal plants, investigating less expensive emission controls for our Tier 2 Units and increasing the amount of gas-fired generation in our portfolio.","We\u2019re proud that our $4 billion capital expenditure plan for 2012 to 2015 is not only reducing emissions in our communities, but is also bringing welcome jobs to Wisconsin and Iowa. At WP&L, we are in the construction phase at Edgewater 5 for an SCR and our Columbia Unit 1 and 2 baghouses and scrubbers.","We are pleased to report that the Edgewater 5 project is proceeding within budget and is a bit ahead of schedule. This project capital expenditures excluding AFUDC are estimated to be $145 million and the controls are expected to be in service by the end of 2012.","Last month, we broke ground on a $627 million controls at Columbia. The BPLs portion of this project is approximately $300 million and the controls are expected to be in service in the first half of 2014.","At IPL, mid-American is currently installing baghouses and scrubbers at Neil Units 3 and 4. IPL\u2019s portion of the total capital expenditures excluding AFUDC is estimated to be approximately $130 million.","We are also in the process of finalizing engineering, procurement and construction contract for the scrubber and baghouse at our Ottumwa facility. IPL\u2019s portion of the capital expenditure for this project excluding AFUDC is estimated to be between $150 million and $170 million.","The environmental work underway at IPL\u2019s Ottumwa and Neil facilities and WPLs Edgewater and Columbia facilities supports compliance with current environmental rules. This year, we plan to request regulatory approval to install the remaining controls for our Tier 1 facilities. They will be ready to comply with the cross state rule or some new version of it.","In Iowa, through the emissions plan and budget filing made on April 2nd, we are proposing adding a scrubber to Lansing 4, which is already in our 2012 to 2015 capital plan.","In Wisconsin, we plan to file a construction authorization request for a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater 5. This filing is planned for the third quarter of 2012 and if approved is expected to add to the capital expenditures post 2015.","We are still in the process of assessing if the cross state rules stay or the final utility MAC rules would change the current Tier 2 capital expenditure projections for 2012 to 2015 of $100 million.","As previously stated, we are exploring lower cost emission control options for these Units. The future of our Tier 2 Unit is heavily dependent on the evolving environmental rules and reliability requirements of the MISO region.","While we continue to rely on lower emissions Powder River Basin coal for the majority of our base load generation, our emissions from our coal plants will continue to decline as our retrofits become operational.","In addition, our emissions profile also improves as we convert some of our older less efficient Units to run on natural gas as we have done with IPL Sutherland Unit 1 and 3 and the Dubuque Generating Facility.","I should also mention that we began this year with 80% of our coal leads under contract for 2012. Because we had an open position, our customers have benefited from the low spot market prices of coal, while our coal inventories are currently within a normal range.","We do not anticipate any issues with coal or transportation contracts take or pay provisions. Alliant is projecting to burn just under 11 million tons of coal in 2012 versus 13 million tons in 2011.","As I noted earlier, natural gas generation is becoming increasingly important in balancing our energy portfolio. In April, the public service commission of Wisconsin approved the WPLs purchase of the Riverside Energy Center, 600 megawatt combined cycle facility to $392 million. This purchase will increase WPLs gas-fired generating capacity by approximate 100 megawatts. We expect the purchase to occur at the end of 2012.","The revenue requirement associated with adding Riverside to retail rate base will be largely offset by the elimination of the capacity payment currently being made to Calpine under the Riverside PPA, therefore making the purchase essentially neutral to customers.","At IPL, we continue to analyze the need for additional long-term capacity and energy, which is being driven by the retirement of generating Units and the exploration of the Duane Arnold PPA.","We received numerous proposals in response to the RFP issued in January seeking firm supplies of non-intermittent capacity and energy delivered to the IPL control area. We\u2019re currently evaluating these proposals as part of our due diligence to see if there is a better option to the construction of a new 600 megawatts natural gas-fired combined cycle generating facility.","We expect to make a decision regarding our plans this summer. The estimated cost of the proposed gas facility is approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC. Our capital expenditure plan currently includes costs related to that facility to begin in 2014 with the anticipated in-service date of 2016 or later.","Turning to wind, the performance from our wind farms has been good with capacity factors averaging approximately 30% and 2011. Production is expected to increase as the additional transmission work is completed.","The transmission upgrades at Bent Tree were recently completed and the rebuild of the transmission line at Whispering Willow was scheduled to be completed later this year. The upgrade of the transmission line from Whispering Willow and Franklin County wind sites is scheduled to be completed by June of 2013. At which time, we forecasted the capacity factor for our wind facilities to average 35%.","Moving to the unregulated side of our business, construction of a 100 megawatt Franklin County Wind Farm in Iowa is proceeding well. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $235 million, excluding capitalized interest costs, and since this project is scheduled to be in service by year end, it will allow us to elect the cash grant option. We continue to seek an off-take contract for this facility.","Before handing the call over to Tom, I would like to provide an update on the RMT sale process. In February, the Alliant Energy Board of Directors approved the plan to sell the RMT business to the volatility caused by lack of the consistent federal renewable energy policy coupled with down pressure on project margins.","We are in the midst of working with parties interested in acquiring RMT and we still expect the sale to recur by year end. As mentioned in our previous analyst call this year, RMT was moved to discontinued operations in our first quarter 2012 financials.","During the same call, we mentioned that the decision to sell RMT would result in a one-time $0.14 per share charge in the first quarter utility earnings due to a change in our state tax apportionment caused by the removal of RMT revenue. We excluded this one-time charge from our 2012 guidance.","Let me recap the priorities as we execute our plans. First, our employees will continue to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service to our customers.","Second, a key objective of our plan is to manage the costs borne by our customers. The rate freeze in Iowa and the proposed rate freeze in Wisconsin allow us to stabilize rates for our customers while earning on our additional rate base.","Third, we are transforming and generating portfolio to one that is balanced and has the flexibility to comply with current and future environmental regulations.","And finally, we will manage our company is focusing on operational and financial discipline with the goal of earning our authorized returns.","Thank you for you interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We released our first quarter earnings this morning with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.36 per share. Adjusting for items, we typically exclude from guidance, first quarter 2012 adjusted earnings were $0.50 per share. The 2012 non-GAAP adjustment is related to a $0.12 per share state tax apportionment change that Pat referred to in her comments.","Comparisons between 2012 and 2011 earnings per share are detailed on slide two, three and four. We had a record-breaking warm weather during the first quarter of this year. We had an adverse impact on our results.","Year-over-year first quarter variance for weather resulted in negative earnings per share impact of $0.16. We are in the process of taking steps to reduce costs to offset a portion of negative weather.","Assuming normal weather for the remainder of 2012, we expect 2012 earnings to be at the lower end of our consolidated earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $3.05 per share.","Moving to the economy in our service territory forecasted 2012 weather normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase very modestly over 2011. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance was based on no sales growth between 2011 and 2012. These trends are illustrated on supplemental slide five.","For the quarter, weather normalized retail electric sales excluding the benefit of the extra day due to leap year were up 1% at both IPL and WPL, driven primarily by the industrial class.","Most of the industrial sales increase at IPL was a result of energy sales to co-generation owners during their first quarter outages. These outages ended in March, thus we do not expect increased industrial sales to continue for the rest of 2012.","The tax benefit rider resulted in considerable quarter-over-quarter variation at IPL under parent. During the first quarter 2011, the tax benefit rider was in place for about one month, whereas the tax benefit rider has been in place for the entire first quarter of 2012. The tax benefit rider resulted in a $0.07 share lower earnings in first quarter of 2012 when compared to the first quarter 2011.","The projected quarterly earnings impact of the 2012 tax benefit rider, as well as the actual quarter-over-quarter impact of the 2011 tax benefit rider is provided in supplemental slide six. As demonstrated in the slide, the tax benefit rider quarterly earnings timing is not anticipated to impact full year 2012 results.","Turning to our financing plans. Two of the primary factors influencing the financing plans are cash flow impacts from our current tax initiatives and our capital expenditure plan. We plan to finance our 2012 capital expenditure plan with cash flows from operations, the sale of IPL receivables and the issuance of short and long-term debt.","Cash flow from operations are expected to be strong in the next few years, as we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments through 2015 and assume modest pension contributions during the next few years. These cash benefits will be partially offset by credits to customers builds in accordance with IPL tax benefit rider.","In March of this year, we extended IPL receivables sales program to provide additional liquidity through March 2014. Our current financing plan anticipates issuing long-term debt of approximately $500 million in the second half of 2012.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2012. They are summarized in slide seven. I would like to provide a bit more detail on the base rate cases.","Yesterday, we filed a proposal to freeze rates for 2013 and 2014 for our Wisconsin retail electric customers. We\u2019re also proposing to decrease Wisconsin retail gas rates by about $13 million for 2013 and then keep gas rates constant through 2014. This proposal includes a recovery of the Riverside acquisition, the Edgewater 5 SCR emission controls and the baghouses scrubber project at the Columbia Units 1 and 2.","The proposed recovery of the capital costs is offset by increased deferred tax liabilities, reduction of capacity payments and changes in the amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities, which include the conservation escrow.","This proposal increases electrical rate base by approximately $400 million in 2013 and an incremental $150 million in 2014. The proposal includes no change to the authorized ROE at 10.4%, and assumes that we continue taking the production tax credits for the Bent Tree Wind Farm.","The financial common equity is unchanged at 51%, but there was a change to the regulatory capital structure due to the decreased OBS adjustments. We believe this proposal is in the best interest of our customers and investors, and we remain committed to earn our authorized return during the proposed rate freeze period. More details of this proposal are provided in slide eight.","We expect the commission will solicit comments from the public on WPL\u2019s proposal very quickly and we do not anticipate the commission will hold a hearing on this proposal. In accordance with the PSE rules, WPL will be filing its 2013 and 2014 fuel costs plans in the second or third quarters of 2012 and \u201813, respectively.","We plan to file an IPO gas retail gas rate case within the next 60 days with a 2011 test year. Interim rates will go into effect 10 days after the filing date and as anticipated we will receive a final order on this case in the second quarter of 2013. It has been seven years since base rates have changed for Iowa retail gas customers.","During that period, plant additions have outpaced depreciation expense and weather normalized residential use per customer has declined approximately 20%. We will be proposing the use of a temporary tax benefit rider to partially offset the requested gas rate increase to minimize the impact of customer rates.","Over the course of this year, we will continue to work closely with our regulators and stakeholders who receive timely approvals to execute our strategic plan. We very much appreciate your continued support of the company and look forward to meeting many of you at the AGA Conference this coming Sunday and Monday. The materials used for this conference as with all conferences will be available on our website prior to the event.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hanson. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hi. Good morning. I was hoping for just a little bit more detail on the WPL rate base. You gave some numbers there that were very helpful. Just want to reconcile that versus the latest forecast. I believe at EEI you showed rate base pretty specific numbers for the next several years at WPL, but when I look at the numbers in this slide on eight here, it looks a little bit lower. If you can just kind of bridge the gap between those two?","Tom Hanson","Sure. First of all thanks Andrew for your question. The single largest driver would be the deferred taxes due to bonus depreciation. The last time those were updated in terms of rate base was the previous rate case which was our UR-117 which was the 2010 base year. So since then we\u2019ve been monitoring those but I think as we do the reconciliation you\u2019ll see that\u2019s probably the single largest adjustment you\u2019re dealing with the deferred taxes.","If you go to supplemental slide eight, we\u2019ve tried to highlight some of the details including the rate base, also the information that we filed with the PSE yesterday and should be available hopefully today. It does take each of the electric and gas rate base components thus compare to the previous rate cases to give you kind of highlight of the increased rate base that we have and how we propose to increase the offset.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. So just to make sure I understand, the changes between EEI and today\u2019s numbers were based on bonus appreciation and not the actual filing versus what we\u2019ve been talking about the past few months? Is that a fair way to put it?","Tom Hanson","That\u2019s correct.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. Very good. And then lastly on the Iowa rate case, I believe you said sometime within the next 60 days, your previous presentation sounded like it would be more like this month. Is that being pushed back and if so why?","Tom Hanson","No. We would expect it would be at the earlier end of the 60-day period.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Great. Thank you very much.","Tom Hanson","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi. Good morning.","Pat Kampling","","Morning, Brian.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Could you quantify what the weather impact was versus normal?","Tom Hanson","It was about $0.12. And that\u2019s both on the electric and gas side, Brian.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Good. So we take your midpoint of 290 and subtract $0.12, that\u2019s where you alluded to being at the lower end of the guidance range, right?","Tom Hanson","That\u2019s correct.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Also in the WPL rate case filing, I reviewed it real quickly. And it looks like you got some sharing mechanisms of ROEs, breakup of 10, 6, 5 and I\u2019m just curious is that the other interveners protecting themselves from the over earning, or are there any levers you might be able to pull that could put you north of 10.4?","Tom Hanson","I think your observation is correct. I mean, given the fact that is a proposed rate freeze, you want to make sure that it was appropriate for all parties. So as we\u2019ve highlighted in slide eight, there really is an ability for first of all WP&L to earn above its authorized 10.4 and it can retain that up to 10.65.","If we are able to successfully manage the business over 10.65 to 11.4, there is a sharing of 50% of that. And anything above 11.4, then it is deferred. Similarly, there\u2019s kind of and net on the bottom end to the extent that our ROE falls below 8.5 then WP&L can\u2019t file for a case. So, we think it\u2019s appropriate for all parties that there is a balance here.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but your 2013 WPL rate base is now 2.3 billion and the 2014 rate base is 2.4 billion?","Tom Hanson","The electric?","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","The total.","Tom Hanson","Yeah.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. And you mentioned some offsets or O&M management to help offset some of the mild weather, I know going into the year, you had a fairly aggressive cost management program. I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about some of those initiatives?","Pat Kampling","Sure Brian. The major initiative is really just delaying hiring and keeping positions opened for longer.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. And the Iowa CCGT that\u2019s being planned, you mentioned better options. What are those better options?","Pat Kampling","When we issued the RFP, we asked actually for whole broad variety of options for again to fill our long-term capacity in energy. So it\u2019s really owning a plant, PPAs et cetera, there\u2019s a wide variety of options that we\u2019re going through right now the analysis on.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. And just back to the to WPL rate base that you filed for and less the deferred taxes I guess as a function of bonus depreciation, can you quantify what kind of cash flow is coming in the door that\u2019s offsetting the decline in rate base from prior disclosures?","Pat Kampling","Yeah. I may be confused on your question. You know, we\u2019re still in this position that we\u2019re not paying federal taxes.","Tom Hanson","We do get the benefit of bonus appreciation\u2026","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay.","Tom Hanson","\u2026as we talked about before. We had about $1 billion of NOLs at the end of \u201811, but we will get the benefit of that bonus depreciation going forward. But recognizing that until we completely eliminate our NOLs, which we expect in 2015, there will be some erosion of that NOLs but recognizing bonus depreciation will be used here in \u201812.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Hey. Good morning.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Jay.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, Jay.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Tom, in the Wisconsin settlement, that the filing you made, is there anything other than the conservation escrow that\u2019s moving around just from a modeling perspective, and understand the previous questions regarding rate base are going to impact that. But relative to the $16 million increase and then what seems to be entirely offset by a reversal of that conservation escrow, is there any other sort of key elements moving around in that filing?","Tom Hanson","There are also some adjustments that we have proposed to what I\u2019m going to characterize as normal regulatory amortization. If you recall we have some reg assets, reg liabilities that are being amortized. Some of the amortization periods were actually adjusted. So that coupled with then the usage of the conservation escrow allows us than to offset the proposed increase.","And Jay, the schedule that we filed with the PSE, that should be available, it does provide a little bit more clarity in terms of the individual items so that it would be able to model that, once that information is available.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. Got you. But what would be the aggregate amount of that amortization? I mean, I assume it\u2019s being extended in life so produced on an annual basis. But what\u2019s the rough ZIP code of those?","Tom Hanson","","It\u2019s nothing significant.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Okay. Got you. And then last quick question. Your transmission rates, I\u2019m not sure you saw yesterday, FERC set for hearing the New England transmission 206 and lots of folks are taking an opportunity to sort of look out to other places that might have an impact. And can you just talk about sort of your relationship between yourselves and ITC and sort of what\u2019s been happening locally in Iowa and whether this is a likely outcome to them.","Pat Kampling","Yeah. Sure, Jay. It really hasn\u2019t been an issue in any of our jurisdictions right now. We are definitely carefully monitoring the situation. And but it has not really been an issue at all. But again, as it relates to ITC, anytime their rates will be up for review. We would definitely way in and have an opinion on that.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to John Alley of Decade Capital.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","Hi, guys. Great work with the settlement.","Pat Kampling","Thank you.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","I just have a few questions and I apologize if this is repeating stuff. But it\u2019s -- the EEI slides for \u201813 and \u201814, EEI was higher by $200 million in \u201813, $300 million in \u201814. Why does that differential grow over the two years or is that rounding?","Tom Hanson","No. We\u2019ve got the additional bonus that we would have also in 2013 that\u2019s certainly contributing to that as well as 2012. Now, keep in mind also we made reference to three specific in-service editions with Riverside and the Edgewater 5 SCR occurring at the end of \u201812. And then we\u2019ve got the baghouse and scrubber at Columbia, that\u2019s occurring about midyear in 2014.","So when you look at the 13-month average for certainly \u201814, you don\u2019t see the full benefit of that in-service addition. So then going into the following year you\u2019ll see them the full effect of the baghouse and scrubber at Columbia and as Pat said that\u2019s about $300 million.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Okay. And what\u2019s the total cash flow of the bonus G&A that you took in \u201811?","Tom Hanson","The total bonus depreciation that we took for the WPL or for\u2026","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","For WPL?","Tom Hanson","It was about $300 million.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","And was there any in \u201812?","Tom Hanson","Yeah. We expect that to be about $200 million in 2012 at WPL.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Got you. And on the equity layer, was that just a negotiating point that it went to 49% from 50% or is there something because of the -- I guess you went from PPAs to rate base, but lower?","Tom Hanson","Its -- there will be assets declining that\u2019s causing that\u2019s slight reduction. But as we said, the financial capital structure is unchanged at 51%.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Okay. When we do your -- I guess when we calculate or try to calculate earnings power for the rate base, is it rate base times 50% or 49%?","Tom Hanson","Use the 49%.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Use the 49%. Okay.","Tom Hanson","That\u2019s what the revenue requirements are based on.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Okay. And then you guys said you had the ability to overrun. How much do you think you will in the next two years with the rate base?","Tom Hanson","Well, certainly our objective is to earn our authorized return. We clearly have aspirations to earn above that. But right now, we want to make sure that we\u2019re meeting our commitment to shareowners to earn the authorized return.","But what\u2019s important is that the proposal allows for -- to the extent that we can earn more than that, there\u2019s a sharing mechanism in place.","John Alley \u2013 Decade Capital","","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Andy Bischof with Morningstar Financial Services.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar Financial Services","Hi. Good morning.","Pat Kampling","Good morning.","Tom Hanson","Good morning.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar Financial Services","","I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of clarity on your industrial demand strength and when in particular you\u2019re seeing that strength, do have some customer requirements there?","Tom Hanson","We\u2019ve seen some increase in the industrial sales. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, IPL we saw about a 4% increase compared to Q1 of 2012 back to Q1 of 2011. However, much of that was dealing with the co-gen facilities that we served.","Some of those co-gen facilities were off to do planned outages. Those planned outages are done. So we think at least for the remainder of 2012 that we will not see any significant increase from our prior forecast.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar Financial Services","","Okay. Great. And then, just one clarifying question on the RMT sale, you\u2019re expecting that still to close within 2012?","Pat Kampling","Yeah. We\u2019re.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar Financial Services","","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Yeah. Hi. Just to clarify on the $2.2 billion of the WPL rate base in \u201813 and $2.3 billion in \u201814. Does that Wisconsin jurisdictional only, so do we add FERC wholesale of $229 million and then 100 plus million for the Minnesota piece?","Tom Hanson","Yeah. We should maybe -- clarify. There\u2019s no Minnesota piece, Brian. But the amount that we stated are all on a retail basis. So only electric, when we made reference to the $2.1 billion gas is another 200 million on top of that, but clearly for the electric side that\u2019s only the electric piece. So as you said, there will be wholesale component that you need to factor into your analysis.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Right. Okay. So we should add $229 million of wholesale on top of that to get the entirety of the WPL\u2019s rate base.","Tom Hanson","Yeah. That\u2019s a good proxy.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","And then add another $126 million for Minnesota to kind of correlate to some of the slides you\u2019ve been putting in your recent presentations.","Tom Hanson","You mean IPL versus Minnesota?","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Minnesota versus IPL. Got you. All right. Very good. Thank you.","Tom Hanson","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Larsen, President; and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat, John and Robert, we will take time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2018 earnings guidance range and announced the 2019 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. We also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2022 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2023 through 2027. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and non-GAAP measures are provided in our earnings release and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia Kampling","Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature. Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the sixth year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later on the call.","Now, let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.","We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan totaling $7 billion as shown on Slide 3. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4.","Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020 is driven mostly by several anticipated gas expansion projects in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade at the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and therefore reduce CapEx for these projects.","In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 through 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making a 10-year plan total of $12.7 billion. Over 1\/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investments in electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardize voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We are also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing.","And speaking of our communities, mother nature was kind to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Several of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after an EF-3 tornado caused catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of homes and businesses suffered major damage during the severe flood that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and it has taken an incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generously assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance.","And last month, we filed a settlement with the Iowa Utilities Board regarding our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term of the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by 5 years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. As we shared with you last quarter, beginning in 2021, our customers will save approximately $60 million annually. This agreement also includes 4 new PPAs from NextEra, which will increase our wind energy in Iowa. With this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. The agreement includes recovery of a onetime $110 million buyout payment to NextEra in 2020, including earning return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We have not included this payment in our capital expenditure plan since it would be recorded as a regulatory asset. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board decision on this settlement agreement before year-end.","Before I conclude my remarks, I do want to comment on the midterm elections. First, they are over and we can all go back to watching TV and answering the phones. I would also assume that your recycle mail pile will now be much smaller. But seriously, we work hard to have good relationships with all elected officials, community leaders, regulators and customers no matter what party is in the lead. We look forward to working with Iowa Governor Reynolds and Wisconsin Governor-elect Evers. We will continue to support policies that serve our customers and our company well.","And with Veterans Day just a week away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 powered veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. And a special happy birthday shout-out to the U.S. Marine Corps. ","I'm excited about our accomplishments so far this year and we look forward to achieving our goals for 2019. Our team will continue focusing on the following: Complete our large construction projects on time and at\/or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advance cleaner energy through additional fossil plant retirements, construction of West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy; deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we'll continue manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","With that, I turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities.","John Larsen","Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. As Pat mentioned, we experienced warmer than normal temperatures in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well, responding to the increased demand for energy. The year-to-date capacity factors at our combined cycle gas facilities have been over 55%. Efficient and responsive gas generation is a great market participant as well as a great complement for existing and future wind resources.","We continue to make great progress on our generation transformation. At the end of September, Unit 4 at our Edgewater generating station was retired. This unit was a 351-megawatt coal-fired generator, which was placed in service in 1969. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the dedicated employees who operated and maintained this unit, providing nearly 50 years of reliable power for our Wisconsin customers. Retiring this unit was another step in our planned energy transformation to focus on customer cost, carbon reduction and advancing clean energy solutions. With the retirement of Edgewater 4, we have now retired or converted approximately 50% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity.","A key part of our generation transformation includes adding efficient natural gas and renewable energy. In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 50% complete and is expected to go into service by the end of 2019. We are also advancing renewable energy with our proposed 150-megawatt Kossuth County wind project. We anticipate a decision on this wind resource in the first quarter of 2019. These 2 resource additions will replace the power from the Wisconsin coal facilities retired to-date and help advance clean energy for our Wisconsin customers.","Moving on to Iowa generation investments. We are making great progress in our plans to add 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. The new wind will be placed into service in 2 phases. The first phase totals 470 megawatts and will be in service during the first quarter of 2019. This phase has 2 projects: The 300-megawatt Upland Prairie project and the 170-megawatt English Farms project. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. The remaining 530 megawatts of wind is expected to be in play -- to be placed in service in 2020.","We believe our generation investments encourage economic development and job creation while meeting customer expectations for cleaner energy. We continue to work with state and local agencies to encourage further economic growth in our service territory. Last month, we celebrated as our Big Cedar Industrial Park became the first site in Iowa to receive the mega site certification. This 1,300-acre site located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa has multimodal transportation options, including air, rail and highway access. In addition, Alliant Energy's nonregulated transportation division, AET, is developing a 75-acre logistics park adjacent to Big Cedar, offering a multitude of supply chain, transportation and logistic services. AET has also recently announced plans to acquire Hybrid Transit Systems, a freight management services company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Along with Big Cedar Industrial Park in Cedar Rapids, our company has also economic -- also has economic growth sites in Ames and Ottumwa, Iowa and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.10 increase were higher electric sales caused by warmer temperatures and higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 5 and 6.","For the first 9 months of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.09 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we currently expect the majority of the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at -- or sorry, WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin retail customers. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance base is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.","As Pat mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's interim rates, following our anticipated retail electric rate filing early next year. We are forecasting IPL's interim electric base rate will go into effect in the second quarter of 2019.","The 2019 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2018. We are forecasting most of this sales growth from commercial and industrial customers in our Wisconsin service territory.","Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 10% for 2018 and 9% for 2019.","We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. We are currently delivering the 2018 savings from Federal Tax Reform to our customers in both Iowa and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, we will also hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service in late 2019.","We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. We have recently renegotiated to reduce transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency spend beginning in 2019 and, earlier this month, FERC issued an order to lower the independent adder that our transmission service providers allowed, thereby reducing expenses for our customers. Last quarter, we also shared with you that we entered an agreement to shorten the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra and add 340 megawatts of new wind PPAs, which will begin saving our customers money in 2021. Lastly, as we bring our planned wind projects into service, lower fuel expenses and production tax credits for our Iowa customers will largely offset the impacts of increases in renewables rate base.","Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 9. We have completed our key financings for 2018 with the issuance of a $500 million Green Bond at IPL in September to finance wind and solar generation projects in Iowa. As we look to 2019, our financing plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity, up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. This 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 10. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion programs and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 Federal Tax Reform benefits with billing credits. Also, since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the DAEC PPA docket and the IPL test year 2017 retail gas rate review. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and November 2018 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2022 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress estimates.","At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So a few different things. First, just in terms of equity needs to correspond with the latest capital plan, wanted to come back to potential equity layer thickness. Obviously, you've got a 51% success in Iowa gas. If you had a similar equity layer at Iowa electric, can you quantify the equity injection needed and kind of how you think about the total quantity of equity needed across the new capital plan and any layer changes?","Robert Durian","Yes. So Julien, yes, right now, as you indicated, we've got a settlement agreement for the gas portion of the business in Iowa that we're awaiting the Iowa Utility Board decision on. We're pretty optimistic that they'll approve that settlement given it's a unanimous settlement. And in that, it had a 51% common equity layer. We will be pursuing a similar layer for common equity with the IPL electric case, which will be filed most likely sometime in the first quarter of 2019. And we'll likely get a decision, hopefully, by the end of 2019 or early 2020.","As far as the amount of additional equity needed to finance that, if we raised the common equity ratio by a couple hundred basis points, it's probably close to $50 million of additional equity that we'll need to be able to finance that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then turning to the '19 guide, can you talk a little bit more about the corporate and other segment? I'm just curious what's moved around there because obviously you have other businesses that contribute earnings historically to that. So is it a shift there or is it just cost? I'm curious.","Robert Durian","There's probably two primary drivers. I think what you're looking at is the revised guidance for 2018 is pretty flat as far as earnings for that business unit whereas the guidance that we put in the earnings release is, I think, a $0.06 to $0.08 loss range. Really, probably 2 primary things I'd point out there. One is additional interest expense. As a reminder, we went through and refinanced several different debt issuances on our nonutility side of the business in 2018 and that is going to require additional interest expense in 2019 once we get the full year impact of that. And then we also saw some additional tax benefits in the first quarter of 2018 related to our Great Western wind project that we won't see in 2019. But generally speaking, all the other businesses are performing as expected and pretty consistent with 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then final one here just on the renewable project and the pushout of cap -- or maybe not pushout, but the reduction in 2019 for renewables. Can you elaborate a little bit more in that change? I mean, it seems like the bulk of it was tied to who's responsible for transmission interconnection and upgrade costs. Can you elaborate? Is it more of a policy? Was that more discrete-specific projects that you're working on? Any commentary?","Robert Durian","Yes. Of that amount that's in 2019, I think roughly $60 million of it was related to the fact that we've reduced our capital expenditure plans for the belief that the transmission providers will now be able to fund that on their own. That was based on the FERC decision that came out in the third quarter and so that's why we revised the capital expenditure guidance. The vast majority though of the rest of the difference there is just moving the dollars around between years just based on finalizing the expected timing of the in-service dates for the various different wind projects. As John indicated in his presentation, we've got about 470 megawatts that we're expecting to get into service in the first quarter of 2019 and the remaining 530 megawatts for Iowa sometime in the 2020 time frame, so just finalizing those timing moved around the CapEx dollars a little bit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from Andrew Wiesel from Scotia Howard Weil.","Andrew Weisel","First, I wanted to ask if you can elaborate a little bit on the IPL rate case in 2019? You indicated in your regulatory slide that it will be both historical test year and one or more future forecasted test periods. What might that look like? Will it be sort of one combined hybrid filing? Could it be 2 or more simultaneous filings? And what -- which expenses might be included in those forecasted periods?","Robert Durian","Yes. So right now, the plan would be to file a test year 2018 historical filing with all of the rate base additions up through the end of the first quarter and that would incur or include all of the rate base additions for really the first half of the wind expansion programs, so think of that as the 470 megawatts of wind projects that we're expecting to put into service in the first quarter of 2019. Concurrently with that filing, we would filing -- be filing a forward-looking test period of either 1 or 2 years. It will either include 2020 and\/or 2021. And that second one would likely include the 530 megawatts of wind projects that we're proposing to put into service in 2020.","Those are, by far, the biggest drivers for the 2 portions of the cases there, but think of those as probably being filed concurrently. We're still finalizing some of the rules as it relates to the forward-looking test periods in Iowa, given that's just a recent legislative change that happened in May. But that's, generally speaking, what we're planning right now.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Then, on the equity, I know you haven't gotten specific on needs in 2020 and beyond, but given what you talked about with the higher CapEx level as well as your answer to the last question about equity ratios, qualitatively, should we think of it as being similar to the '19 or somewhere lower than that, given the drop-off in CapEx? Just sort of directionally, any related thoughts?","Robert Durian","Yes. We have not indicated any information as far as the 2020 equity layers. We'll most likely have better information for you sometime towards the end of 2019. Really, your observations are correct. We are seeing additional capital expenditures in 2020 based on the latest CapEx update, but we are also targeting a higher equity layer in IPL that's going to require some additional equity. We also have the Duane Arnold PPA buyout that we're expecting to get a decision on soon that would require us to fund about $110 million of a payout in late 2020 that would drive some of our equity needs in 2020. So those are all the key factors that we'll make a decision on most likely sometime in the second half of 2019 and share that with you guys at that time.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Good. Then, on the distribution CapEx, some nice increases for both businesses. Can you describe a little bit more what drove those positive increases, particularly in 2020?","Patricia Kampling","Yes, sure. I'll take that, Andrew. We're actually looking at really cost-effective ways to serve customers better. And as you put more automation on our systems, underground systems and actually standardize voltages, we're just finding out that these are really good economic investments to serve customers. So as we evaluate other alternatives for the distribution system, we'll be adjusting the CapEx as well, but we've got a really good plan right now and still really confident going forward accelerating some of the investments.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Sounds good. Then one last one. I realize I'm asking a bunch here, but any latest thoughts on the latest FERC decisions on allowed transmission ROEs and adders and can you remind us your sensitivity to the ROEs there?","Robert Durian","Yes. I'll take that one, Andrew. Just as to thinking about this from two perspectives, one is from a customer cost perspective. Obviously, the transmission service costs are part of the billings that we make to our customers in both jurisdictions. The independents adder recent reduction from ITC based on the FERC decision will help our customer billings in Iowa.","But then the other side of it is the earnings impact from our ATC investment. Right now, we've got built into our models a base ROE of 9.7% with a 50 basis point adder at ATC for 2019's earnings. As a reminder, it's not a significant impact on our earnings profile for 2019. So I wouldn't expect that to have a real material impact unless there's something significantly different from that, but generally speaking, it's right around 10.2% is what we've got built into the forecast.","Patricia Kampling","And Andrew, the reason that we challenged the independents adder was that our transmission provider in Iowa we don't consider independent anymore now that they have a new owner. So that's why we went through that process to have FERC decide that, which they did relatively quickly.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

(Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.","With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter 2014 earnings and reaffirming 2014 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued yesterday and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter certainly goes down as one of the most memorable for those of us within, in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I must thank our men and women, who tucked it out and go to work each and every day and never lost focus on providing exceptional customer service.","I'm pleased to report that our first quarter earnings that we are discussing today are the highest in company history. Driven mostly by the reduction nuclear capacity payments and realizing increased electricity and gas sales from both economic growth in our service territory and the weather.","Tom will provide more details on the financials, but in summary those three items alone increased earnings by $0.31 per share over the first quarter of last year. However, we do recognize that this winter was typical for some of our customers. Especially in dealing the entire utility bill.","Earlier this year, we contributed $3 million to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to help our income eligible customers with their utility bills. We have also expanded our customer outreach efforts and are working with customers to help them other funds of the systems and payment plan options.","On a positive note, we are trying to continue to improve in our service territory, unemployment rates are below the national average, with Iowa's rate now at 4.5% and Wisconsin's at 5.9% five year both for the State.","Some of the trends we are experiencing include our modest increase of number of retail, electric and gas customers. Continued expansion by our industrial customers and a slight increase in the used per customers. This is certainly encouraging and we will continue to monitor sales and determine if the weather normalized sales growth experienced in the last quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of this year represent a sustainable growth trend.","We have incorporated our first quarter weather normalized sales growth and chartered by 2014 sales forecast. We are now forecasting 1.7% in retail weather normalized, electric sales for challenging your 2014 over 2013.","Now let me update you on our regulatory activities. We have made the regulatory filings proposing retail electric base rate freezes, through the end of 2016 in both Wisconsin, Iowa and have proposed low rate gas base rate in Wisconsin for 2015.","For WPL electric customers, we've proposed that retail electric base rate, which was set in 2011 we may have their current levels through the end of 2016. We also requested that retail national gas customer base rate will reduce by $5 million in 2015 followed by a freeze on those rates through 2016.","We are pleased that we are able to offer set of deductibles with a input from the Citizens Utility Board, Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff. The WPL's approval includes return off and on the significant investments made in our Michigan folks office, at Columbia and Edge Water as well as in industrial and electric and natural gas system.","To recovery of these investments, is to be offset with changes in the amortization of the Energy Efficiency Regulatory Liability. We expect to have $64 million in the Electric and Gas Energy Efficiency Liability at the end of 2014 and we're hoping $17 million of it for 2015 and $32 million of it for 2016.","We've also proposed the continuation of the 10.4% ROE, a common equity ratio of slightly above 50% and the ROE sharing mechanism established in the last rate case. The Commission has requested comments on the proposal by no later than Tuesday, May 20. We anticipate the PSCW will make a decision regarding our request in the second quarter of this year.","The two monitoring level will be addressed outside of this proposal and mostly changed to be set annually. We expect to make a few only filing for 2015 in the next 90 days. In March, we're announcing unanimous retail, electric base rate settlements between IPO. The Office of Consumer Advocate, Iowa Consumer Coalition, and the Large Industrial Group to freeze retail electric base rates for Iowa customers through 2016.","This settlements includes customer billing credits of $70 million for 2014, then $25 million for 2015 and a final credit of $10 million for 2016. We have agreements from all the parties in the IUB and again to credit customer bills as of yesterday.","The credits are subject to a true up based on the IUB's final decision. We anticipate a decision on this proposed settlement on the second quarter of this year. If this settlement is approved, it will extend the retail electric base rate set in 2011, through the first quarter of 2017.","The settlement allows for continuation of the Energy Adjustment Clause, the Transmission Rider and the Electric Tax Benefit Rider through 2016. The settlement are based, are maintained in the current authorize your term equity in common equity ratio and earning a return off and on the 2014, year in Iowa Retail base rates of approximately $3.1 billion.","Rate base additions include investments in the emissions patrols, performance improvements at a Ottumwa, George Neal, Burlington and Prairie Creek as well as investments made in our distribution systems.","Pending IUB's approval of this settlement is arguably but the next retail base rate case will be filed in the first half of 2017. The 2017 case will be a request to recover the cost associated with the Marshalltown Generating Station, which we anticipate with a place and service in the second quarter of 2017.","Let me provide a quick update on our Marshalltown Generating Station. We've recently received the air permit and have filed all the permits with the IUB and our request for the Issuance of a Generating Certificate, which we anticipate by the end of May.","The community is very excited about this project and we currently expect to be in construction in July. As a reminder, the IUB approved a return on common equity of 11% to the 35-year depreciable life of the facility and a use of 10.3% on common equities for the calculation of AFUDC.","In order to establish $920 million cost cap, including AFUDC and transmission upgrade cost. Recently that the cost cap is sufficient to complete the project including the transmission upgrade that we anticipate ITC will self-fund. We expect that ITC will build IPL directly for the relevant climate, related to the Marshalltown transmission upgrade, once the line is in service and expecting the cost to go through the transmission rider.","Now let me quickly brief you on a current emission control construction activities. This is year that the majority of our emission and coal projects will be completed. In Wisconsin, construction of the baghouse and scrubbers at Columbia units 1 and 2 is 98% complete on time and below the original budget.","Units 2 equipment was placed in service last month and preliminary test results indicate that performance guarantee are being and achieved. We anticipated in service 6 for Columbia unit 1 is in July.","Also construction has already started on scrubber and baghouse with an expected completion in 2016. The installation of baghouse and scrubber for our Ottumwa facility is on budget and anticipated to be placed in service in November 2014.","In addition, MidAmerican is installing baghouses and scrubbers at Neal units 3 and 4. The Neal 4 project was placed in service at the end of 2013 and the Neal 3 project is expected to be placed in service, this month.","In addition to the progress we are making on transforming our Tier 1 units. We are also making progress on preparing our Tier 2 units to be compliant with the utility mercury and air toxic standards by the April 2015 deadline.","We are currently installing low-cost controls at our Prairie Creek and Burlington generating stations and are converting the ML Kapp generating station from coal to gas. Through year end 2013, we spent $20 million on these facilities and our 2014 to 2017 capital expenditure plan includes additional investments of approximately $35 million.","We believe, we are well positioned to ensure a balance, flexible and environmental environmentally generating fleet that will serve our customers well into the future. Late last year, we noted planned capital expenditure, starting 2016 for additional generation of WP&L. our current forecast indicates, a need for capacity and energy in 2019 during by the plan retirement of three coal units and by sales growth.","As part of our long-term planning resource efforts, WPL is investing a feasibility study of resource options. We plan to issue a request for proposal in the second quarter of this year to determine what available options exist in the region. Following analysis of the ARP results, we anticipate making the regulatory filing with the PSCW in late 2014.","Our current capital expenditure plan includes a new 300 megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle generating facility as a placeholder until we determine the desired resource.","Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a successful first quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver another solid year of earnings in 2014. We will continue to manage the company, striking the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impacted customers.","We have a plan that will continue to meet our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We are making progress transforming our generation portfolio to one that is balanced, with lower emissions and that has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations.","At the same time, we are focused on economically leading energy capacity needs of our customers. We've continued to work closely with our regulators and stakeholders to receive fair and timely outcomes.","And finally, I must acknowledge and give thanks to our dedicated workforce, which not only provides outstanding service to our customers, but also delivers the financial results that we are discussing today. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We announced 2014 earnings last evening, with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0. 79 per share, these earnings are a $0.25 per share increase over non-GAAP earnings of $0.72 per share in the first quarter 2013. Our non-GAAP earnings adjustments in first quarter 2013 related to the preferred stock redemptions at both utilities.","Comparisons between 2014 and 2013 first quarter earnings per share are detailed on Slides 2, 3 and 4. First quarter 2014 earnings were higher than first quarter 2013 primarily due to the estimated weather impact on electric and gas sales and lower capacity payments related to the expiration of purchase power contracts associated with the Duane Arnold Energy Center and the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant resulting in a cost reduction of approximately $32 million.","Those expiring capacity payments will allow us to earn a return on and off rate base increases at both utilities of keeping retail electric customer base rate stable. We experienced weather normalized sales growth in the first quarter 2014.","Forecasted retail sales trends between weather normalized 2014 and 2013 are illustrated on Slide 5. Weather normalized sales grew as result of an increase in number of customers, use per customer and we believed customers utilized space heater, due to coping cost increases in shortages.","In addition, several industry customers expanded their operations which increased weather normalized sales at both utilizes. Industrial segment experiencing electric sales growth due to planned or production expansion include chemical, health services and manufacturing.","In November, we issued our consolidated 2014 earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.55 earnings per share. The 2014 guidance assumes normal weather and modest sales growth. Due to the strong first quarter earnings resulting from the higher than expected sales, we currently anticipate full year 2014 earnings will be toward the top end of our range.","Third quarter results are significant driver of our full year earnings and in light of the first quarter results, we now have flexibility to accelerate operations and maintenance projects that were scheduled for later periods. For these reasons, we are changing guidance at this time.","IPL's tax benefit rides resulted in a $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter variation in the first quarter 2014, when comparing to the first quarter 2013. The actual and projected quarterly earnings impact of 2014 tax benefit riders are provided on Slide 6. The tax benefit riders are not expected to impact full year 2014 results.","The walk from the 2013 to the 2014 projected affected tax rates are provided on Slide 7. Please note that the 2014 effective tax rates include electric and gas bill credit of $97 million through IPL tax benefit riders.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong. Given the earnings generated by the business. We also expected benefit given, we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2016 nor do we expect to make any contributions to our qualified pension plans over the next two years, since they were approximately 95% funded at the end of 2013.","We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. Our financing plan assumes that the sale of our Minnesota distribution assets closes in 2014. The estimated growth sales proceeds of approximately $130 million are expected to be used to reduce IPL's financing needs.","The sale requires State and Federal Regulatory approvals. We filed for the approval of both the electric and gas sale with the MPUC earlier this year. These transactions will also require IUB and FERC approvals.","Our current financing plan anticipates issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt at both utilities in the latter half of 2014. We also plan on refinancing the $250 million 4% debt at the parent and the $60 million at the Franklin County Wind Farm. We currently anticipate issuing approximately $150 million in aggregate of new common equity in 2015 and 2016. We do not plan to issue any material new common equity this year. We may adjust plans as deemed appropriate, if market conditions warrant and as our equity needs continue to be reassessed.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets for 2014, which are summarized on Slide 8. We will wait the decision on both the IPL unanimous proposal settlement through 2016 and the WPL retail proposal for calendar year 2015 and 2016. We file IPL's Emission Plan and Budget in April. As you may recall the Emission Plan and Budget is the regulatory evaluation process for major environmental projects in Iowa.","The plan we filed, is consistent with our current capital expenditure plan. In Minnesota, we recently filed the Bi-annual 15-year integrated resource plan for IPL. Included in the plan is the anticipated 10-year whole contract IPL will have Southern Minnesota Electric co-op as a result of the proposed electric distribution sales in Minnesota.","Further, [indiscernible] a need for additional energy later this decade. We will continue to evaluate our options to meet these future energy needs. In Wisconsin, we plan to request in the second quarter, 2014 a certificate of authority to install an SCR at Columbia Energy Center's unit 2, as well as a filing for the proposed generation investment at WPL in the fourth quarter, 2014. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout this year.","At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hanson. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","My first question is, after the rate settlement in both states, what is \u2013 is there any impact to the rate base outlook? You haven't confirmed them in the slide but are there any big or small changes to the growth outlook.","Pat Kampling","No, Andrew the slides were provided in IR deck are still the latest.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay and that's consistent with the settlements?","Pat Kampling","Yes, it is absolutely yes.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Then next question is, if I heard you right Tom I think you said that you're going to accelerate some O&M. thanks to the strong winter, is that stuff mostly from the next few quarters or is it more structural program that might have a long-term impact?","Tom Hanson","Well, first of all we certainly have flexibility in terms of looking at the expenditures. Some of those could be expenses that we were originally planning for next year could be pulled into this year.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, great and then my last question. I think your commentary on the equity need was unchanged. Is there any opportunity that if, the rest of the year has normal weather and you're able to sort of keep the benefit from the strong first quarter, any chance to postpone that or is that sort of independent of the near-term trends?","Tom Hanson","Certainly, we will continue to evaluate that the exit that we are forecasting is more driven because of the incremental CapEx but certainly with the level, we will have stronger cash flows. So that will be so the input as we continue to assess the equity needs.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc","I'm sorry, if I missed this earlier but could you just elaborate on the weather normalized sales growth forecast that we should be using for 2014 and beyond?","Tom Hanson","Yes, Pat said right now we're targeting approximately 1.7% in both jurisdictions recognizing that we did have a strong fourth quarter and strong first quarter, but we want to be careful that there were few events in both of those quarters that might suggest that sustainable maybe not be at those two levels.","So certainly, we are very pleased with the growth recognizing that we are seeing this across all sectors in both states, but until we really have more insights with second quarter. We will continue to certainly focus on the sales, but as Pat and I highlighted in the script. We are seeing additional customers as well as additional usage and with the industrial sector expansion as well as list additional needs.","We are certainly encouraged by that.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc","Okay, great and can you comment maybe on the O&M expense trends that you're seeing to kind of put prospective with your sales growth?","Tom Hanson","If you can go back and look at our O&M, it's been fairly flat, we have been able to manage that with one exception you'll note that with the energy conservation in Wisconsin that does fluctuate a little bit, so you'll see that moving but in terms of as we look on a going forward basis. You should expect kind of similar profile of O&M from what we've seen in the past.","So what we are looking at in terms of potential bringing into 2014 would be nothing that I would characterize is being as unusual.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc","Okay and then lastly could you just comment on the $0.03 positive impact on the optimization of gas capacity contracts at IPL?","Tom Hanson","Sure, first of all we've had this program in place for many, many years. if I say, we \u2013 it's the other utilities in Iowa, as well it allows us to optimize our gas utility assets and just given the significant in terms of market volatility and the opportunities presented to us. We were able to capture additional benefits in the first quarter of 2014 and in fact that represents about almost twice of what we captured calendar last year.","So it was $0.03, the other thing it's important. This is also an opportunity to continue to help our gas customers and they get the benefit of this program as well.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc","Okay and one more question, at the high end of your guidance. Do you break through any of your sharing bands or now?","Tom Hanson","Well, we'll be close but recognizing as you know Brian third quarter is the big quarter for us. So until we get to that level, it's probably premature but certainly our forecast assuming weather normal, would suggest that we are close to the top end.","Operator","We will go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","So, just generally on your rate proposal or your settlements. Do you expect that you'll be able to earn the allowed returns under each of these?","Pat Kampling","Yes, absolutely Steve again that's assuming the rate base assumption, I'm giving you in the IR deck.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay and is there something that would indicate that those rate base assumptions are going to change?","Pat Kampling","Not materially in the two-year capital expenditure profile that we re-provided. These are well-known projects with pre-approvals so that should remain basically within those ranges.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","And then I believe in Wisconsin the equity ratio is higher than it had been in this current proposal, is that correct?","Pat Kampling","Just slightly, though.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, so that doesn't really change your kind of overall plan, in terms of putting more equity in there in terms of your financing plan?","Pat Kampling","No, it doesn't change.","Operator","We will go next to Andrew Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Just a couple of questions, first; can we just go a little bit more in detail over the Iowa settlement relative to Duane Arnold and kind of have the numbers, kind of work as far as the capacity savings?","Pat Kampling","Sure, I mean Susan can give you more details with you, on this if you like but the real takeaway for this settlement is that, we are giving customer credits back over the next job of years. When the customer credits decline and that's what's helping us achieve the increase in returning on our rate base because the rate base is going up?","So keep in mind, the 2014 the customer billing credit is $70 million. [Duane] $25 million in 2015 and [indiscernible] $10 million in 2016.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","So, they're the basically \u2013 they're replacing what would be rate increases without obviously effecting the customer but benefitting the bottom line, is that currently how you look at it?","Pat Kampling","The base rate is getting frozen and the credits are going through the fuel clog.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","That's great, then I guess as I kind of work through the numbers. Well actually let me just step back, so as you look at 2014 you're saying you're at the top of the range. Obviously there was weather included in that but at the same time. You're accelerating O&M from 2015, so I guess absent even the weather there was a good chance. You were going to be at top end of the range, based on what you're seeing thus far again assuming normal weather.","Is that a fair statement?","Pat Kampling","Andy, just to be clear. You know with the weather that we saw in the first quarter. It's definitely pushing us through the top end of the range and Tom's statement is that we actually have flexibility to move some O&M projects from future years. If necessary depending on how the rest of the year plays out.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Okay, but I guess what I'm saying, if you assume normal weather and you're going to move the O&M already and there was what $0.12 of weather I think, I'm not mistaken, there's normal. You probably would have been at the top end of your range, regardless?","Pat Kampling","Yes, it was a very large impact in the first quarter on weather.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","And again, I know you don't have and giving guidance for 2015 or 2016 and that's going to come towards the end of this year as you always do, but seems to me looking at kind of consensus estimate for 2015, 2016 they're probably about $0.10 to low. So the question I have is, if you end up coming in at the top end of your range. It's kind of normal earnings, not caused by weather of course would that be kind of the base that we would grow off of?","Pat Kampling","You know, I think we'll have to wait till the end of the year to make that decision. Right now, we are looking at whether normalized from last year as our base. This year has started out to be little unusual and we'll just have to evaluate that as we go throughout the year.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Okay and then another question, I have is if bonus depreciation works ended at the end of the year. How would that affect your need to issue equity?","Tom Hanson","As I said, currently we are not forecasting to be a federal taxpayer until the first quarter, 2016. So obviously we have some impact and as I said at the equity needs are for calendar year 2015, 2016.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Right, but if bonus depreciation was extended. I would assume that your construction program would benefit from that and I guess the question is, would it possibly lessen the amount of equity that will need to be issued in 2015 and 2016.","Tom Hanson","Well certainly it will be a key consideration, as we continue to analyze the need. So rest assured that, if the extenders get approved that you will be analyzing the impact of the equity needs.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Okay, I mean I guess you guys are going to be at this comp so I can go over some now, longer term numbers with you, but it seems to me that the earnings [indiscernible], the company and again you're going to get these settlements kind of done and sealed. But it seems that are there are these other companies probably lot greater than the people, who are forecasting right now, but I guess they'll be patient and wait for the year and kind of finish out first.","Tom Hanson","Thank you.","Pat Kampling","Appreciate that. Thank you, Andy.","Operator","And Ms. Gille there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

We appreciate your participation.","With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Robert Durian, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; as well as other members of the Senior Management Team. Following prepared remarks by Pat, Tom and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's third quarter 2016 earnings, and narrowed 2016 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements.

That release also provided an updated annual capital expenditure plans through 2020 and our forecast for total CapEx for 2021 through 2025.","I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Warmer than normal winter temperatures lowered first part of earnings with warmer summer increased third quarter earnings resulting in a year to date temperature impact sales being close to normal. Therefore temperature variances had virtually no impact on our year to date earnings. So with summer behind us, we are narrowing our 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint remaining at $1.88 per share which is consistent with earnings guidance provided to the November 16 on a post-split basis.","Tom will provide details for the quarter later in the call. As we previously indicated 2017 earnings guidance will 2017 earnings guidance will be issued in conjunction with our yearend call this February. However, I am reaffirming that our long term earnings growth objective remain at 5% to 7%. Yesterday we also announced a 7% increase for our targeted 2017 common dividend to $1.26 per share. 2017 dividend target payout ratio is consistent with a long term progress dividend payout ratio 67% consolidated earnings. We also issued our 2016 to 2020 updated capital expenditure plan totaling $6.6 billion as shown on slide 2.","In addition on slide 3, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 plan to our current plan. As you can see the changes are driven primarily by additional renewable generation investment offset partially with lower capital project that are part of the company.","As you can see on slide 4, we have provided a 10 year view of our forecasted expenditures. These investments in first five years of the 10 year plan are higher than previously disclosed as we are accelerating our previously forecasted renewable investments for IPL and WPL to take advantage of Federal Production Tax Credit. We are fortunate that we have the ability to serve our customers with economic renewable generation which has the added benefit of providing stable fuel cost.","As energy technologies evolve we will continue to evaluate our investment opportunity to better serve our customer. Our current plan does include additional generation need beyond 2020 as we anticipate about the renewable and natural gas generation investment. While reviewing slide 4, it is also important to note that over 50% of the 10 year capital plan has projected to enhance electric and gas distribution systems. Customers and communities expect us to maintain liability by creating a system that has increasingly interactive and dynamic. This includes making investments that includes making investments that accelerate the integration of new technologies including distributed resources.","Also for your convenience we have already posted on our website EEI Investor Presentation that details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures for 2020 as well as updated rate base and construction work in progress estimate.","Now let me preview on our Fed regulatory activity. Last month we shared with you the settlement reached with the customer groups in Iowa relating to our advanced rate making principle filing associated with 500 megawatts new wind project in Iowa. I am pleased to report that last week the IUB issues order on the proposal in an excavated [ph] fashion. Each times the order ensued a cost cap of $1830 per kilo watt including allowance for funds used during construction and transition cost, a return effectively of 11% until the life of the asset and depreciable life of 40 years.","The new project is included in our capital expenditures and construction work in progress forecast and they repaid estimates assume 250 megawatt are to be in service from 2019 and the remaining 250 megawatt in service in 2020. We are currently evaluating the bids from the wind suppliers and should have that selection by year end to qualify for the 100% of the federal production tax credits. Renewable energy is currently a meaningful part of our energy sources, including 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and approximately 730 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The new Iowa wind project will add up to 500 megawatts, which will place Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for its customers.","We also plan to transfer the 100 megawatt Franklin County wind farm to IPL from Alliant Energy Resources and we\u2019ll file that request with FERC later this month. If our application is approved by FERC, we would expect to transfer Franklin County to IPL during the first quarter of 2017. We expect the investment to be evaluated as part of our revenue requirement for the IPL rate case filing in the spring of 2017. The Franklin County wind farm would then be combined with its neighbor IPL\u2019s Whispering Willow Wind Farm.","In addition to IPL\u2019s additional 500 megawatt wind expansion in the planned transfer of the 100 megawatt Franklin County to IPL, we are exploring options for IPL and WPL to own and operate additional new wind generation. Our current estimate of capital expenditures assumed 400 megawatts of additional new wind generation split evenly between IPL and WPL. But the final size and allocation between IPL and WPL is subject to change any further evaluation.","Solar generation is also an expanding part of our balance generation portfolio as we continue to gain experience and are best integrated into the electric system. We now have several solar projects within our service territory including Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill in Beloit at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We believe initiatives such as these, as well as our announced solar collaboration with the city of Dubuque are important to bring in renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create a sustainable energy future.","Now, let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities with forecasts investments of $1.2 billion. Included in that is approximately $300 million for electric distribution system to continue to make the more robust, reliable, and resilient. This year\u2019s plan also includes approximately $170 million from improvements and expansion of our natural gas distribution business, almost double prior year spending. And we broke ground at the Riverside expansion in September.","We expect the output from the new Riverside expansion to be approximately 700 megawatt and the total interest paid to project cost remains at approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction and the combustion turbines are G Frame 7, some of the most efficient unit and production.","The courts have recently signed the letter of intent to acquire approximately 60 megawatts of Riverside, which is subject to PSCW approval. Once approved, the cops will start acquiring their share of the project during the construction phase. Also the PSCW approved the revised operating plan to allow for WPL to increase its ownership share of Columbia, whereas WPS and [indiscernible] will decrease their ownership share.","In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and it\u2019s approximately 94% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project are anticipated to be approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017. Riverside and Emery are two primary existing gas generation facilities continuing to experience increase this batch when compared to last year.","During the first nine months of 2016, Emery is averaging 40% capacity factor and Riverside average capacity factor exceeding 55%. The ability to lean on our gas-fired generation during periods of low gas prices and also as a flexible resource during periods of low wind or cloudy days, demonstrates the value of gas resources and our balance energy mix.","Moving to our existing coal fleet, we\u2019re nearing the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facilities. WPL\u2019s Edgewater unified scrubber and bag house project was completed on time and below budget earlier this year. Construction of the Columbia unit to SCR is approximately 35% complete and the total CapEx is anticipated to be $50 million and is expected to be in service in 2018.","There are several new regulations on the horizon dealing with ash ponds, bottom ash, and water usage at our coal-fired generating stations. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate the work needed to comply with these rules and regulations and ash pond closures and bottom ash conversion projects already underway in Iowa. In Wisconsin, the PSCW approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5.","The total capital expenditures for our water and ash program are anticipated to be over $155 million during the next 10 years and are included in our capital expenditure forecast and rate base projections. During the past two years, we have been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We've made progress building a generation portfolio that is lower emissions, very fuel diversity, and it's more cost effective.","The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fires and renewable energy generation, installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities and lower levels of coal generation to reduce the economic dispatched retirements and fuel switching. We've also started water and ash programs at our facilities to be current and expected future environmental requirements.","And I'm proud of that we've accomplished all that by holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WL this 2011. Let me summarize the key messages for today. We will continue to deliver 2016\u2019s financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide 5% to 7% earnings growth and then 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend increased by 7% over 2016 dividend.","Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at a below budget and in a safe manner; working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and communities in a collaborative manner; reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities.","And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to thank him for his thoughtful leadership and being by my side through the past five years. The strong relationship he developed across our company, industry, and investor community have made a difference for our customers, employees, and share owners, and wish Tom and his family all the best as he transitions to a new phase of life.","I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.80 per share, which was $0.01 per share lower than the non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slides 5, 6, and 7. The non-recurring $0.23 per share charges for the third quarter of this year relate to the asset valuation charges for the Franklin County wind farm.","As Pat indicated, we plan to seek FERC approval to transfer this asset to IPL and per Iowa Administrative Code, the transfer must be made at the lower cost to market. The current value of the Franklin County wind farm as of September 30th, 2016 was determined to be approximately $33 million subject to working capital adjustments. When 2016 earnings guidance was issued in November 2015, we forecasted temperature normalized retail electric sales would increase 1% for the two utilities. Through the first three quarters of this year, temperature normalized sales increased almost 1%.","IPL sales are relatively flat year-over-year, whereas WP&L sales had exceeded 1% sales growth forecast. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth customer classes year-over-year in both utilities. The third quarter 2016 results included adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect the recent FERC decision related to the first complaint and the anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the ROE levels charged by transmission owners in MISO. The reserve for the first complaint reflects an all-in ROE of 10.82% and the reserve for the second complaint reflected an anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC ALJ\u2019s initial decision on the second complaint issued in June of this year. We are expecting a FERC decision by the second quarter of 2017 for the second complaint.","Now, let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. Since we are through the three quarters of this year, we have narrowed the 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.84 to a $1.92 per share, which leaves the middle point still at $1.88 per share, consistent with the guidance we issued in November 2015. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to remind you of a couple unusual negative drivers for the fourth quarter 2015 earnings.","First fourth quarter 2015 temperatures negatively impacted earnings by $0.04 per share on a post-stock basis. Also we recorded additional reserves related to ATC in the fourth quarter of 2015 since the ALJ issued the opinion on the first MISO ROE complaint. And, finally timing of income taxes was a negative driver on the fourth quarter of 2015. These reminders should assist you with your estimation of the fourth quarter 2016 earnings.","Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC. On this slide, we estimate an allied energy consolidated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 4% lower than our effective tax rate guidance provided as part of the second quarter call. The reduction in the estimated effective tax rate for the consolidated energy is primarily the result of the Franklin County asset valuation charges recorded this quarter.","As I conclude my last earnings call remarks, I would like to extend my best wishes and thanks to all the analysts, investors, and employees. It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know all of you. I'm very proud of how this company has evolved over the last 36 years. And all of you have been instrumental in making the journey memorable and successful. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Robert to review the financing plans and regulator calendar.","Robert Durian","Starting with our financing plans, our current forecast reflects strong cash flows, given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the five-year extension of bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments to 2021.","With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021, due to the additional wind investments included in our plans, this forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions, as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next two years. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios, as well as high quality credit ratings.","Our 2016 financing plan assumes we\u2019ll issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our shareowner direct plan. We have completed the long-term debt issuances for 2016, which included issuing long-term debt of $300 million at IPL and $500 million that are non-regulated businesses. $310 million of such proceeds were used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our parent and non-regulated businesses.","Our 2017 financing plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity, as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust these plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.","As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and renewable investments in our capital expenditure plans. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 will be financed by operating cash flows and a combination of debt and new common equity. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL consistent with the most recent retail base rate case decision.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9. For IPL, our permit applications for the Clinton Natural Gas pipeline and then up to 500 megawatt Iowa wind investment have been approved. Later this quarter, we plan to file a request with FERC to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL.","We anticipate receiving a decision on this request prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in the spring of 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas base rate case in the second quarter of 2017. For WPL, we filed our 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas base case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff. This filing includes new pricing options and an increase in the fixed charge component of tariffs. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1st, 2017.","Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during the year end call. Typically during the third quarter call, we provided our following year's earnings guidance. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. As Pat mentioned, the presentation for this event has been posted in our web site this morning.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open up the call for questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the one-hour time frame for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","Hi, good morning.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Russo","Sorry if I missed this early, but the 7% dividend growth target in \u201817, how does that kind of translate into your targeted payout ratio?","Pat Kampling","Sure, Brian. Yeah, we're still in our targeted range of 60% to 70% and you'll get more clarity on that answer when we release the earnings guidance at the year-end call in February.","Brian Russo","Understood, so, I know - I know you're not giving \u201817 guidance, but could you put that in context? Is that at the higher or the lower end of the range or just comfortable within?","Pat Kampling","Yeah, Brian, I\u2019ll just have to leave it where I answered it. I'm sorry.","Brian Russo","Yeah, understood. And then in terms of the post 2017 capital needs, should we think about the timing of equity more with the timing that some of the large scale projects are commercially operational or is it just - is it more so your target capital ratios at the utilities?","Pat Kampling","Brian, I\u2019ll let Robert to respond to that.","Robert Durian","Yeah, good morning, Brian. Yeah, what we're doing is we're targeting capitalization ratios that are consistent with our rate case decisions for both IPL and WPL. And so, the equity needs beyond 2017 are largely going to be driven by the capital that we need for the Riverside expansion, as well as the wind investment that we're proposing. So, there will - during constructions, it will actually be towards the end of the cycle, which is in the 2019-2020 timeframe, we will need some most likely equity before that.","Brian Russo","Got it. Okay. And you mentioned the C&I customer sales and growth. Can you just maybe elaborate on kind of which industries you're seeing strengthened?","Tom Hanson","We're seeing some across the board. What\u2019s important here is it\u2019s more a reflection of maybe adding a second or third shift. We're seeing some expansions relapsing and new companies coming under our service territory. But we do have the benefit of seeing some benefit across various FIC codes. But as I stated, it's more in Wisconsin than in Iowa at least for 2016.","Brian Russo","Got it. And could you tell us what the weather impact to earnings were versus normal in the third quarter?","Robert Durian","What we saw - this is Robert. What we saw in the third quarter is actually a $0.02 increase of our earnings as a result of weather in the third quarter and actually for the year-to-date for about a penny ahead of forecast for the first nine months.","Brian Russo","Okay, great. Thank you very much and Tom best of luck in the future.","Tom Hanson","Thank you, Brian.","Pat Kampling","Brian, see you next week.","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Alliant Energy First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank you all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Robert Durian, Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter 2017 earnings. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our first quarter 2017 and year end 2016 earnings release, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2017 results and I will also share several major milestones that occurred in April. Next, Robert will provide the details on our results as well as review our regulatory schedule.","Like other utilities in the region we enjoyed a mild winter, but it did lower our first quarter results by $0.04 per share. This winter was even warmer than last year, in which we realized $0.02 per share lower earnings when compared to normal temperatures. Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share.","Despite the mild temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.43 per share, which was the same as the first quarter of 2016. With the exception of the mild weather these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88.","This long-term growth objective continues to be supported by the utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. We achieved several milestones and advanced our strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operations on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL filed an electric rate review on April 3, and interim rates went into effect on April 13.","Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with a full load testing heat rate of 6,610 Btu per kilowatt hour, better than the contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability's to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production complements Iowa's vast wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels of the generating units it is replacing.","Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, its cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs, including AFUDC and transmission, came in at approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million.","Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL the Envision Platinum Award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first Envision Platinum Award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assessed Marshalltown on 60 sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We are very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group.","I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort. And I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you.","In Wisconsin, we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission.","The three electric cooperatives signed a letter of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we expect PSCW approval of the agreement by the third quarter, these co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades. And we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside.","Wind energy has been an important and now increasing part of our energy portfolio. Wind energy brings many benefits to our customers and communities, including the annual lease payments to farm families and property tax payments that support the rural communities that we have the privilege to serve. Also, our owned wind farms have remarkable performance in the first quarter, with a total average capacity factor reaching over 40%. And IPL customers are now benefiting from the energy produced by our Franklin County Wind Farm, which is now part of Whispering Willow.","We are pleased that the state of Iowa encourages generation investments. In late last year, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our plan to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. Terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset, and depreciable life of 40 years.","As we discussed with you earlier this year, we were able to secure enough equipment to not only assure the approved 500 megawatts qualified for the 100% PTCs, but also qualified additional wind investments for 100% PTCs. Our current capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional up to 200 megawatts each for IPL and WPL, for a total wind expansion of 900 megawatts replacement service by 2020.","However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the full 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTC. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL.","As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plans still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plan to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites. As is our regular practice, we plan to provide updated capital expenditure estimates in November prior to the EEI Conference.","Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our upcoming collaboration with the City of Dubuque and the solar facility for West Riverside, which are both in the planning stages. These projects will be an addition to the three existing solar facilities located at our Rock River Campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy.","The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and expansion of our underground electricity distribution network are just some of our targeted investments.","Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems while, at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. And this year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, two-way energy flow and allow for remote reads, connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019.","We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WPL received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time-of-use pricing plans, demand rate pilots, a fixed bill option and lower renewable energy rates. IPL has proposed a revised time-of-day option for residential and small businesses, an economic development rate and a couple of pilots for small customer demand rate and a limited income rate. And both our Iowa and Wisconsin customers are taking advantage of our rebates for installation of EV charging stations.","We continue execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility and wind and combined-cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil-fired combustion turbines and diesel-generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward our carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030.","Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, and we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout target is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share.","We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget and at a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, customer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. We continue to focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016.","Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 2 and 3. New WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went in effect January 1, contributed to higher earnings in the first quarter of 2017. These increased earnings were offset by the negative impacts of mild temperatures, higher fuel expense and higher depreciation expense from rate base additions. Excluding the impacts of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 increased more than 1%.","Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we shared our updated view of our earnings walk comparing 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 EPS guidance range on Slide 4. The update quantifies the impacts of higher IPL and WPL revenues due to the retail base rate increases as separate drivers in the earnings walk. As shown on this slide, the 6% growth in earnings is primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in WPL's recently approved retail electric and gas base rates and IPL's interim electric base rates that went into effect April 13. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes.","During the past seven years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rate flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advance cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase.","Interim rates include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Interim rates associated with this rate filing went into effect April 13. Therefore, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. To assist you in modeling, we estimate that the $0.20 per share increase in earnings from IPL's interim electric rate increase will be spread across 2017, with approximately 25% recognized in the second quarter, 45% recognized in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter.","Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with a refund related to the lower transmission ROEs and tax benefit rider billing credit. This will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be $74 million. As in prior years the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results.","Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. The WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases, which went into effect January 1st, reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization.","As part of the WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization [ph] of the rate increases in your forecasting models for this year. We estimate that the $0.18 per share increased earnings impact would be spread across the quarters, with approximately 35% recognized in each of the first and fourth quarters, approximately 25% in the second quarter and minimal increase in the third quarter.","Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 through the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carry forward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.","There have been no changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed.","As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decisions.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter. And during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers.","For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where our retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers.","In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize the schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGA meetings on May 22.","In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions to remand the New England ROE case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second MISO ROE complaint. We continue to reserve those ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point adder. We are monitoring any potential impacts to this court decision on the second MISO ROE complaint and ATC's ongoing authorized ROE.","We received the refunds for the first MISO ROE complaint earlier this year and started refunding the IPL portion back to Iowa electric customers this week. The WPL portion of the refund will return to Wisconsin electric customers in accordance with a future regulatory proceeding.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn it back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] It appears our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Nick Campanella","This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien. I was just curious, as we include the extra 200 megawatt wind at IPL into the CapEx plan going forward, how should we be thinking about any additional opportunities at the backfill post 2020, keeping with the long-term EPS growth profile. Just trying to get a sense of kind of what direction you're looking at initially just as PTC opportunities decline.","Pat Kampling","Sure. Thanks for the question, Nick. Now this is still an evolving story as we look for acquiring additional sites in Iowa. So it's a pretty active process that we're going through right now. Although we're very pleased that we do have the additional capacity to increase the wind filing in Iowa, I wouldn't assume that there'll be more after that. But again, if we do find that, we'll definitely let you know. But we'll probably update the CapEx plan in November again with the EEI deck. This is all still a bit preliminary until we make our regulatory filings.","Nick Campanella","Got it. Okay. And then is there any specific reason to do more at IPL rather than WPL in this case?","Pat Kampling","We're actually finding really good sites in Iowa for Iowa customers, and the Iowa regulatory climate, is very supportive of additional wind. As you recall from our last docket, when we got the 500 megawatts approved, we were encouraged to come back and do more, so really just following up on the last docket that we had in Iowa.","Nick Campanella","Got it. Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I look forward to sharing highlights of our strong year-to-date financial and operational performance, along with sharing key elements of our plan to power what's next for our customers and communities. Robert will provide more details on our financial results, our financing plans, and our capital expenditure plan.","Last night in our earnings release, we increased our earnings guidance for 2019, based on the sales performance experienced so far this year, which has been largely driven by weather. Our updated guidance reflects a $0.06 per share increase from the previous midpoint. We are forecasting another year of 5% to 7% growth, our ninth year in a row, and a track record we intend to keep up. For 2020, we expect earnings between $2.34 and $2.48 per share. The midpoint of this range dollars, $2.41, is a 7% increase from our forecasted 2019 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.25.","Keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.52 per share. Later in this call, Robert will share more details about our financial results and guidance targets.","Last night, we also shared our five-year investment forecast, which totals $6.8 billion. Our investment plan reflects our continued journey to accelerate renewable energy, a path we've been on for more than a decade. Over the last year, we've been developing a clean energy blueprint. The first phase of this blueprint outlined several areas of investment, with a focus on putting renewable energy to work for our Wisconsin customers and communities. Improving economics, sustainability goals, and delivering on customer expectations are key drivers for our transition to renewable energy.","Last week, we announced a key element of our clean energy blueprint, the expansion of our Wisconsin solar generation by up to 1,000 MW by the end of 2023. We are taking advantage of the continued cost reductions for solar generation, along with the near-term opportunity to capture investment tax credits, which makes solar a cost-effective renewable energy choice for our customers.","When looking to transform our generation fleet, we thoughtfully balanced many factors that include reliability, customer rates, strengthening the communities we serve, and our talented employees who have served our customers with tremendous care and service for decades. These factors will guide us as we evaluate the path for future retirements of our Wisconsin coal facilities. More information will be shared over the course of the coming months, as we further outline these elements in our Wisconsin clean energy blueprint.","Our capital investment plan also reflects the planned investments in our electric and gas distribution systems, designed to ensure our customers continue to benefit from safe and affordable energy. We are planning for the future needs of our customers, and making investments in our communities to help drive economic development opportunities.","Our plans include developing a strong distribution network that enables additional local energy resources, and we plan to move more of our electric lines from overhead to underground, further strengthening the grid and helping to reduce impacts from severe weather events. And our plans are mindful of customer cost impacts. We expect to reduce the number of substations and add devices that use smart sensors to detect problems and improve our response, resulting in more efficient and safe operations.","Now, let me update you on our progress with some of our current strategic projects. In Iowa, we continue to see great progress on the significant wind investments we're making for our Iowa customers. Earlier this year, we placed 470 MW of wind into service, and we're making great progress with the remaining 530 MW of new wind. This will complete our planned 1,000 MW of new wind for our Iowa customers by the end of 2020. We are also nearing completion of our AMI meter deployment in Iowa, with all meters expected to be installed and operating by the end of this year.","For our Wisconsin customers, we're making progress constructing the 150 MW Kossuth wind farm. We expect to place this project in service by the end of 2020, and we're nearing completion of our West Riverside Energy Center, a 730 MW, highly efficient natural gas facility that will be an important complement to our renewable generation resources. We expect to continue our long track record of delivering projects on time and on budget.","The third quarter also saw strong operating performance from our existing gas generation, with year-to-date capacity factors exceeding 70% . Low natural gas prices and strong wind resources resulted in lower fuel costs for our customers. The financial and operational results we are communicating today would not be possible without the dedication of our employees, and the strong community partnerships we have developed. We're delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities.","Recently, the new Commerce Park in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin was certified by the state for economic development. Later this month, the Ames, Iowa Economic Development Commission will recognize Alliant Energy at the Economic Impact Awards, for our commitment to the Prairie View Industrial Center, and also the Alliant Energy Digital Manufacturing Lab, both located near Iowa State University. These achievements would not have been possible without the countless employees and community officials who contributed their time, energy and talents.","I'm excited about our accomplishments and look forward to achieving our goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of focus. Continuing our solid track record of project execution, completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in renewables, high efficiency natural gas, and distribution networks; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance, and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and, we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers.","With Veterans Day only a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to all veterans, and the many proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home.","I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share, compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year over year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to an increasing rate base, and the timing of income tax expense. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 2 and 3.","In the first nine months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. In 2018, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of reserves, for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense were also a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.","As John mentioned, last night we issued our consolidated 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.34 to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the 7% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020, and IPL's retail electric rate review settlement, which is subject to the Iowa Utilities Board final decision. Our guidance assumes IPL's new 2020 electric base rates will go into effect in the first quarter of next year.","The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2019 . We are forecasting most of this sales growth from commercial and industrial customers.","The details of our capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 4. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current capital plan on Slide 5. You will see on the capital plan walk, we have increased our forecasted investments in renewables, and decreased electric and gas distribution investments when comparing last year's plan to this year's plan. This is consistent with our objective to make the best investment decisions on behalf of our customers, with a constant focus on customer affordability.","Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of positive 10% for 2019, and negative 11% for 2020. The additional production tax credits from the new wind projects being placed in service, and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2020, are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.","We remain very focused on controlling costs for our customers. We continue delivering the benefits from federal tax reform and lower fuel costs to our customers in both Wisconsin and Iowa. In Wisconsin, we will hold electric and gas base rates flat through 2020, by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be placed in service in the coming months.","In Iowa, we will be flowing back tax benefits to customers as part of the 2020 test year retail electric rate review settlements. And, as we bring 530 MW of new wind projects into service next year for our Iowa customers, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in renewables rate base. In addition, we have added new wind PPAs and amended the Duane Arnold PPA, which will begin saving our Iowa customers money in 2021.","Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 7. We have completed our 2019 long-term debt financings with the issuance of a $300 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind generation projects in Iowa. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $200 million of new common equity under the 2019 equity forward agreements by year end.","As we look to next year, our 2020 financing plan includes issuing up to $250 million of new common equity, and up to $950 million of new long-term debt across our two utilities and Alliant Energy Finance. $650 million of long-term debt will be maturing next year, so a majority of the proceeds from the 2020 financing plan will be used to refinance existing debt.","The 2020 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, the September 2020 DAC PPA termination payment, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers, and the settled IPL rate review, which would increase IPL's allowed common equity component of its capital structure by 200 basis points.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 8. Since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the IPL retail electric and gas test year 2020 rate reviews. We expect the Iowa Utilities Board's decision on these settlements by year end.","We also filed a construction authority request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in western Wisconsin. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. Next year, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for additional solar generation, and a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation, and a November 2019 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2023, as well as provides updated rate base and construction work in progress forecasts.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within the one-hour timeframe for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Alex Morgan","Hi, good afternoon. This is Alex Morgan dialing in for Julien. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more commentary around your dividend growth rate versus your EPS growth rate, and more or less kind of discuss your different trajectories there.","Robert Durian","Yes. As John indicated in his prepared remarks, we generally have grown dividends in line with our earnings growth, in that 5% to 7%, which you've seen that consistently over the last couple of years, including our projections for 2020, so no real differences between that. We currently have our dividend payout ratio on the bottom half of our 60% to 70% targeted range, but we're generally comfortable with that, as we're going through more of a heavy CapEx cycle right now.","Alex Morgan","Okay, thank you so much. My second and final question is just, if you have any more information about the equity issuance that we should be seeing in 2020? Whether that be potentially a block issuance, how we should be thinking about the ATM going forward and then beyond 2020, what we should more or less be thinking about when it comes to equity for the company?","Robert Durian","Yes, as we announced last night and this morning, we're planning on issuing up to $250 million of new common equity for 2020. To answer your question, beyond 2020 right now, we do not expect any material equity issuances. We do have a direct plan where individual sharers are allowed to reinvest their dividends, which generates roughly about $25 million a year in proceeds. We expect that to continue on beyond 2020, but that's the only equity we see in the foreseeable future.","Regarding the remaining $225 million for 2020, we have had success in the past issuing equity under ATM programs, when we've had smaller needs for equity. Last year, as many of you are aware, we did issue an equity forward for a larger equity issuance of $375 million. This amount, at $225 million really gives us a lot of flexibility to use either one of those types of programs in the future. I had also indicated that the timing of this will largely be dependent on our financing needs and the market conditions, so also a lot of flexibility there.","We have not yet determined what method to use, but see, like I said, a lot of flexibility in our opportunities going forward.","Alex Morgan","Okay, thank you so much. That's all from me. Have a great day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar [ph] with Guggenheim Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, how is it going? It's actually James for Shar. I just wanted to ask on the new Wisconsin solar, could you remind us what the recovery route for that would look like? Is it a rider, is it the base rate cases?","John Larsen","Yes, this is John. We would see that as being, as Robert noted in his remarks, we would be looking to file the first regulatory filing for that in the first part of 2020. That would be a CPCN, so that would be through the normal regulatory process and rate review event.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it, yes. Just on the quarter, one of your peers saw some weaker industrial load. It looks like you guys were kind of flat, maybe the customer count was down a little. Are you seeing anything of concern? I know you've had C&I growth in your go-forward, but just any weakness you saw this quarter?","Robert Durian","James, we've seen somewhat lower temperature-normalized sales relative to last year. I think through the first nine months of the year, our temperature-normalized electric sales were about 0.7% lower than last year. This has largely been in our Iowa jurisdiction with our larger industrial customers, due to various operating and business issues with those individual customers, including experienced some pressure as a result of the agricultural economy challenges, because of the ongoing trade issues.","But we are very fortunate, we've got a very diversified mix of industrial customers, more agricultural-based in Iowa, and more manufacturing-based in Wisconsin, so nothing significant. I would note too that the lower sales that we have seen are from our industrial customers, so they have generally lower margins, so it's not been enough to have any material impact on our variance drivers for earnings.","The economies in the two states as a measure of unemployment are remaining strong, they are well below the national average, and we have seen some growth in our customer accounts. I think we've added about 5,000 electric customers relative to this time last year.","So, all in all, no concerns from us, but we're definitely watching some of the ongoing trade issues as it impacts our agricultural-based economies in the two states.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.","Andrew Weisel","Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the IPL settlement. I've got a couple of questions, I know it still has to be approved, but my first question is, I know you had a lot of intervenors on board, maybe 15 or so. Of the parties that didn't participate, what were some of the sticking points? Do you see those as potentially turning into a big deal?","John Larsen","Yes, Andrew. I'll maybe start out. We had many of the intervenors that did sign on, so we are very pleased with that. There are a number of parties that intervene just to be part of the process, so I would probably characterize it as, those that had most of the interest in the rate case were signed-on parties to our ultimate settlement. But again, there are some parties that are part of the rate proceeding, which is typical in any rate proceeding. I'll ask Robert if there's anything else you want to add on to that.","Robert Durian","No, I'd say the ones that did not sign on were just there to more learn about the process and for information purposes, not necessarily to influence the process.","John Larsen","Yes. Thanks for the question.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, so from what you can tell then, there are no debated points, anything around rate design, perhaps? Or, are they more fine-tuning issues, in your mind?","Robert Durian","Yes, just to be clear, as part of the settlement process, we really aligned around the revenue requirements. The rate design issues still are pending, and we had to go through a hearing process with the Electric Rate Review to discuss those issues. Those were not part of the settlement process, and will be decided by the Iowa Utilities Board when they make their final decision by the end of this year.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then similarly, I believe there's a lot of talk about the rider for renewables and you've got, as you mentioned, 1,000 MW in Iowa by the end of next year. Can you may be talk about your latest thinking about whether you might want to file again in 2021 or 2022? All assuming that the rider is in the final IUB decision, that is.","Robert Durian","We really see the renewable energy rider as a win from a perspective with that, so we think the chances of us having to file again next year are very remote at this point, assuming it gets approved by the Iowa Utilities Board. With that rider, and the fact that most of the rate-based additions we see in 2020 are with the wind projects we're putting into service in Iowa, we don't expect a need in 2020 to file another rate case.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. One last one on the CapEx walk. You showed the buckets there, I appreciated the reconciling, basically, the old forecast versus the new one. It looks like a good amount of spending was pushed from 2019 to 2020. Was there anything specific you can point to as far as an overall trend, or is that just a bunch of individual things that happened to all be moving in the same direction?","Robert Durian","I think it's more of the latter, Andrew. What we saw is in 2019, we have had some extreme weather conditions in our service territory. We had a very extreme cold spell in the first quarter of 2019. We've also had, I would say, wetter-than-normal conditions, and that created a few challenges for us when it comes to some of the wind farms that we're trying to put into service in 2020. Nothing significant. We're very confident that we're still going to get these wind projects in on time and at or below budget, but they have pushed out some of those wind projects, maybe a few months, and so you see a little bit of that spilling over into 2020. But no concerns from my perspective","Andrew Weisel","All right, thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Larsen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President and CFO; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat, John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's year end and fourth quarter financial results, and we affirmed the consolidated 2018 earnings guidance issued in November 2018. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our earnings release and our 10-K, which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia Kampling","Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was another excellent year for our company and I'm happy to share our financial results with you today.","Our 2018 financial results did benefit from higher sales due to more extreme temperatures than normal. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.17 include a $0.06 net benefit from temperatures. When we normalize for temperature, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 is 6% above last year as shown on slide two.","2018 was the fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. I am also reaffirming our 2019 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.24 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7% re-based off our 2018 temperate normalized results.","Our long-term growth guidance through 2022 is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures.","Now on March 1st, we plan to file our first future test year of rate reviews in Iowa. For electric customers a 2018 test year will be used for interim rates and a 2020 future test year for final rates. For gas customers, they will be based only on the 2020 future test year. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year end.","As I shared with you previously, the electric rate review will include recovery of our significant investments in wind energy, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.","Interim rates based on a 2018 test your will also include known and measurable rate base additions that occur by the end of the first quarter. Since the English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms are expected to be in service in late March, interim electric rates will be effective on April 1st so those projects can be included.","Customers will receive the benefits of reduced fuel costs and PTCs from the windfarms concurrent with the implementation of interim rate.","We will also be requesting modifications to simplify our rates and to reduce the huge variance in summer and winter pricing that has frustrated our customers for decades. We will also be proposing new product offerings for customers interested in partnering with us and their renewable energy efforts.","And we are requesting a renewable energy rider which would allow recovery of new investments in renewable energy when they are placed in service if the project has already received advanced rate making approval.","While the base rate increase and the benefits from lower fuel costs and PTCs will vary by customer class, the overall net impact on electric customer bills will be in the low to mid single digits. Further details will be available after the filing is made next week.","I must acknowledge that our financial and operational results are achieved through the hard work and dedication of my served employees. These employees proudly serve customers each and every day and safely restore service no matter the conditions.","This past year brought many challenging days, including dealing with major flooding, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. And during the recent polar vortex, I am pleased to report that our systems held up well, and our employees were able to maintain gas and electric system integrity and reliability.","So on behalf of our customers and investors, I'd like to thank all of our employees for providing excellent service even in the toughest conditions.","Now to summarize, I'm very pleased with our 2018 accomplishments and our team is committed to again delivering on our financial and operational goals for 2019. We have a great track record and we'll continue to deliver results as we focus on the following, completing our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner, advancing affordable and cleaner energy through substantial investments in wind, construction of our West Riverside Energy Center and additional fossil plant retirements, delivering on 5% to 7 % earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70 % common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to congratulate him on being named my successor effective July 1st. I am so proud of what we've accomplished at Alliant Energy in my seven years as CEO and I know that under John's leadership the company will continue to thrive. Congratulations, John.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities.","John Larsen","Thank you, Pat. My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you have developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.","Good morning everyone. 2018 was a solid year for Alliant Energy, both financially and operationally. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments. I'll focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address financial outcomes and regulatory matters.","I'm pleased to report that our investments in renewables, natural gas and grid operations are resulting in improved reliability and lower carbon intensity. Our fossil fuel generation capacity factors and grid reliability improved by nearly 10% compared to our five-year average.","And most importantly, our 2018, safety performance improved significantly compared to the previous year. Our focus will be to continue making the necessary investments to deliver safe, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers.","We began the transition of our generation portfolio to a greener and more efficient fleet nearly a decade ago. This transition started with the retirements of our smaller, less efficient fossil fuel generation stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions.","In 2016, The Iowa Utility Board approved the first 500 of our 1,000 megawatt planned wind additions in Iowa and in 2018, the remaining 500 megawatts was approved. Of the 1,000 megawatts of approved new Iowa wind, we are on track to bring 470 megawatts into service next month, and the remaining 530 megawatts in 2020.","In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730 megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 70% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year.","In 2018, we advanced renewable energy in Wisconsin with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval to purchase 55 megawatts of the Forward Energy Wind Center and the approval to construct a 150 megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa.","We continue to power what's next as we advance our clean energy vision. In 2018, we installed environmental controls at two generating stations, retired 480 megawatts of capacity and advanced decommissioning efforts at four facilities in our Iowa business. We now have permanently retired approximately 30% of our fossil fuel generation capacity since 2005, and by 2050, we will eliminate all existing coal from our energy mix.","Once facilities are decommissioned, we are restoring and redeveloping the land. Rain gardens, pollinator habitats and sites for solar panels are just some of the ways that we are sustainably reusing our assets.","A great example of this is in Beloit, Wisconsin. This year Beloit College will open their Powerhouse facility. The college is repurposing our decommissioned Blackhawk Generating Station into a state-of-the-art student center. These are just a few examples of how we are putting our core value of act for tomorrow into practice.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. As we close out National Engineers Week, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John, and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company's past, present and future success.","Alliant Energy engineers have been at the center of virtually every major project at our company and their skills and expertise, enables us to improve the lives of our customers. Thank you.","Yesterday, we announced 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share, compared to $1.93 per share in 2017. The key drivers for the $0.24 increase were higher margins from increasing rate base, the net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, and higher allowance for funds used during construction.","These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the year on slides three and four.","In 2018, temperatures in our service territory increased Alliant Energy's retail, electric and gas margin by approximately $0.11 per share. Due to WPL's earning sharing mechanism, we\u2019ve reserved the higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at WPL and will give those back to our Wisconsin retail customers in the future.","In addition, Alliant Energy's performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense.","Therefore, the 2018 temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense are estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in earnings.","Our consolidated 2019, earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 per share to $2.31 per share. I will walk from the midpoint of the 2018, non-GAAP temperature normalized EPS to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range, as shown on slide five.","The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and our wind expansion program in Iowa.","These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019, and will be reflected in IPL's electric interim rates, following our retail electric rate filing next month.","Slide six, has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of a 11% for 2019. We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. In Wisconsin, we created the electric and gas customer bills by approximately $40 million in 2018, for current year tax savings generated by Federal Tax Reform.","Going forward, we expect to hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next two years, by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes resulting from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including, bringing our new, highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, into service at the end of this year.","We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. In 2018, we generated almost $50 million of tax savings from Federal Tax Reform that we're giving to our electric and gas customers.","We also negotiated reduced transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency charges beginning in 2019 and advocated for a lower independent adder charge by our transmission service provider, all helping reduce expenses for our customers.","In December, 2018, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the agreement to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra early, which will begin saving our customers' money in 2021.","Lastly, as we bring on into service our planned wind projects in 2019 and 2020, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in rate base from these wind projects.","Moving to our financing plans, our 2019, plan remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $400 million of new common equity.","$370 million of this equity was price to equity forward agreements executed in December 2018. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next six months to fund capital expenditures for our two utilities. The remaining $25 million will be issued ratably during 2019, through our Shareholder Direct program.","In 2019, we also plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. The 2019, financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities. Regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers, and the approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW.","These 2019, financing plans, support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our two utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decision. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives note on slide seven. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial goals for 2019. We very much appreciate your continued interest in our company.","At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open up all of the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within one hour timeframe for today's call. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Nick Campanella","Hey, it's Nick Campanella on for Julian, today. How are you?","Patricia Kampling","Hello. Good morning, Nick. How, are you?","John Larsen","Good morning.","Nick Campanella","Good morning. So for the upcoming test year at IPL, I think, it's been pretty well-telegraphed that you want to go after higher equity layers. Could you just kind of give us a sense of what's assumed in your - in your long-term 5% to 7% EPS guidance in terms of equity layers at IPL? I'm just trying to get a sense of how incremental it would be to your base plan?","Robert Durian","Yes, Nick, this is Robert. So, as you probably recall, when we filed the gas case for test year 2017 in Iowa, and we requested a higher equity layer and received through a settlement agreement approval from the IUB to raise that up to 51%. So I would use that as a long-term projection for the 5% to 7% EPS growth.","Nick Campanella","Got it. And then as we kind of think about equity post 2020, if we assume the CapEx program remains constant, as it stands today, is it safe to say that there is no more equity needs after your 2020 period?","Robert Durian","Yes. Nick, based on the capital expenditure program that we shared with the investment community back in November, with the exception of some small amounts to the share redirect plan, which usually average about $25 million a year. We're not expecting any major equity beyond 2020.","Nick Campanella","Thanks very much. And Pat, congrats on your retirement announcement, and John, congrats as well. Looking forward to working together. Thank you.","Patricia Kampling","Thanks, Nick.","John Larsen","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you. Good morning. I want to echo the congratulations to Pat and John as well.","Patricia Kampling","Thanks, Andrew.","John Larsen","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","If I may, just to clarify the last comments you made there, you were talking about equity beyond 2020, but you haven't yet addressed what the 2020 need will look like. Is that right?","John Larsen","That is correct, Andrew, yes. Consistent with our previous communications, we plan on providing investors the 2020 equity amount in the second half of this year. After we have some more insight into the IPL capital structure for 2012, that will be decided in the upcoming rate filing.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Got it. Just wanted to clarify that. My other clarifying question is the Duane Arnold, early termination was approved, as you mentioned. Should we expect the treatment to look how you were hoping it would look with the November update? In other words, the $110 million will not be in the CapEx plan, but it's a regulatory asset and therefore would be in rate base?","John Larsen","That is correct, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, terrific. Then lastly, the more kind of high-level question I want to ask. I understand, there's some conversations in Iowa about potentially changing the pace and style of rate case filings, if you will. And I don't mean the hybrid case that you've been pretty clear on for this year. I'm talking more about the idea of potentially combining electric and gas or potentially going in - and more of a regular two year schedule like you have in Wisconsin. Is there any feedback you're able to share at this point? I know, it's preliminary, but is that something that you think is likely to happen going forward?","Patricia Kampling","Yes, I'll answer that one. At a high level, we're still working with the regulators in Iowa on what the rate cases should look like going forward. This future test year, the one that we'll be filing next week is really the first case that will be using these new guidelines. So we'll be talking with them.","One of the things they did do in our case is, they do want electric and gas to be filed separately, although the procedure will be the same. So we're just working on this case and let's see what it can look like going forward. So good discussions happening in the state.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. I guess I need to be a bit more patient. Thank you, everyone.","Patricia Kampling","Yes, sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. Congratulations as well. So two questions, so one is, I understand that your CapEx plan was heavy or somewhat front-end loaded given expiring subsidies for wind, how do you think, about solar - given the drop in the solar panel prices and that was seem to be - seeing a shift in utility CapEx to solar versus wind. So is it possible that we're going to see meaningful increases in your CapEx plan beyond 2020, driven by solar CapEx?","John Larsen","Yes. Hi, Angie, this is John. We certainly continue to look at solar as opportunities for our customers and when that makes sense. That will certainly play into our resource mix.","So just like we had with our early wind developments, we are in solar development phase right now, taking a look at opportunities. So we'll continue to look at that and we're encouraged by the dropping in pricing.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. But you would not consider commercial renewable investments, something that we've seen at other regulated utilities? Meaning outside of the rate base?","John Larsen","Yes. This time our primary focus would be solar that would make sense in our ongoing resource planning.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And my other question is, I remember, we talked about how high transmission costs insulate bills of your IPL customers. So is there a solution there, i.e. I mean, given what's happening with the data about transmission ROEs at FERC or maybe some more focused on distributed generation, is there a way to somewhat alleviate this impact on the customer bills?","Robert Durian","Hi, Angie, this is Robert. So-yes, I would say we're actively involved with the FERC filing. We've provided comments to that filing and our interested in answering the appropriate levels of ROE, given that does have a direct impact on our customer bills. So you should expect us to be very involved in that process and look forward to get into a good resolution with the FERC at some point here in the future.","Patricia Kampling","And Angie, we have constant dialogue with our transmission provider in Iowa, as well just to make sure that our planning assumptions are aligned and we prioritize the work together. So there is ongoing dialogue in Iowa on the work that's being done as well.","Angie Storozynski","But I was asking more from the perspective of you could at least avoid future transmission cost and transmission CapEx by developing community solar platforms, something to that extent, but actually would accrue more to your rate base and would be probably beneficial for the customers?","John Larsen","Yes. Angie, this is John. Certainly taking a look at those options where we can have lower cost installations by either avoiding some of the transmission costs or placing that in locations where the transmission element is smaller. It obviously puts us toward the lowest cost solution for our customers. So we continue to look at those options.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. But those are not yet reflected in your CapEx plan, is that fair?","John Larsen","Correct.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are John Larsen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President and CFO as well as other members of the senior management team.","Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy\u2019s second quarter financial results and reaffirm the consolidated 2019 earnings guidance issued in November 2018. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters discussed in Alliant Energy\u2019s press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our Quarterly Report on the Form 10-Q which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to John.","John Larsen","Thanks, Sue. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I am first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. Robert will then provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.","So, for the headlines, first, we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and are trending toward delivering results in the upper half of the range. And third, we continue to execute according to plan on key strategic generation and distribution investments for our customers. We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, cleaner and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. The Upland Prairie and English farm wind additions were on schedule and below budget continuing our long track record of solid project execution. These projects were also awarded Envision Platinum Certification from ISI. To earn this honor, a project must demonstrate it delivers environmental, social and economic benefits to communities. The platinum level is the highest rating possible and affirms that our investments in a clean energy future not only help us to reduce carbon emissions, but are the right thing to do for our customers and communities. We are making nice progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa customers. This will complete IPL\u2019s total planned 1,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy by the end of 2020. Although we experienced some unfavorable weather this past spring, we have made adjustments and expect to deliver these projects on time and on budget.","Overall, our second quarter generation capacity factor was on par with our 5-year averages. While our coal unit saw a slight decrease, our gas and newer wind units provided a balance with increased capacity factors. Wind energy and efficient natural gas generation bring many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are building the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 90% complete and is expected to be completed on time and on budget.","Also, we are expanding our use of solar generation, with the construction of a solar garden near our Marshalltown Generating Station and we are well into the process for a similar solar installation at the West Riverside Energy Center. Solar was the focus of some new tariffs recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Three new tariffs were approved that will help enable us to provide more renewable options for our customers. While not large in size, they provide opportunities to bring tailored renewable solutions to our customers. And now, I\u2019ll focus on what drives Alliant Energy\u2019s success. Our workforce, many of you have heard or read about a series of devastating storms that hit our Wisconsin service territory on July 19 and 20th. The storms produced 14 tornadoes damaging straight line winds and significant rainfall. At the peak of the storm more than 30,000 of our customers were without power, and statewide totals were exceeding 250,000. After the storms cleared, I\u2019m proud to share that we had 75% of our impacted customers back online within 36 hours. With those able to take power restored soon after.","Our commitment to safety, the dedication of our teams and the strong partnerships we have with our communities and emergency response professionals are just a few of the many reasons, I\u2019m proud to lead our company as CEO. Along with these storms, July brought with it, higher temperatures resulting in increased demand. Our estimated temperature impact on electric sales for July is $0.02 per share. I\u2019m pleased to report that our generating fleet operated as expected during the higher temperatures mitigating the impact of higher fuel costs for our customers. And finally, I\u2019m excited to mention that next week we will launch our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and provides a broad view of our company\u2019s performance in the areas that are of most interest to our many stakeholders.","Our everyday actions enhance the environmental social and economic conditions of the communities we serve. We\u2019ve had the privilege of serving our customers for more than 100 years. We look forward to continuing that tradition for decades to come. I encourage you to review the online report and see how we\u2019re creating a better tomorrow for our customers, communities and investors. To summarize, our team is committed to delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following. ","Continuing our solid track record of project execution, completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner, advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in wind, solar, high efficiency natural gas and the distribution network, consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target, and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year driven by lower electric and gas sales due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2019 and timing of income tax expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on slide two. Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance continues to be a range between $2.17 and $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including the West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin and our wind expansion program in Iowa. Increasing our wind generation portfolio and operating our highly efficient natural gas generating units at higher capacity rates are resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers. Our second quarter production fuel and purchase power expenses dropped 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. This is just one example of how we are working to control costs for our customers.","Our temperature normalized electric sales through the first half of 2019 have been slightly lower than expected, primarily in our Iowa Utilities Industrial class. About half of the lower industrial sales in our Iowa jurisdiction are due to operations issues at some of the larger customers. Temperature normalized retail electric sales at our Wisconsin utility have increased over 2018, including higher industrial sales from two large customers returning to normal operations after prolonged outages. As a reminder, industrial sales earned lower margins when compared to other retail classes, thus these changes in electric sales did not have a material impact to our earnings. To assist with modeling our results throughout 2019, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all four quarters this year. First, the interim rate increase in Iowa went into effect April 1 thus skewing the earnings growth more to the last three quarters. Second, our Iowa utility has higher electric rates in the summer for mid-June through mid-September, resulting in a higher proportion of earnings in the third quarter. Lastly, the timing of income tax expense recognition will result in lower earnings in the first half of the year and higher earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the quarter results in 2018.","Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities and our consolidated group for the full year 2019. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation to our portfolio the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in lower effective tax rates for several years into the future.","Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 financing plan which remains unchanged. In June, we completed the issuance of $350 million of debt at our Wisconsin utility and used the proceeds to refinance $250 million of debt that matured in July and to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Through July, we have completed about one-third of the $400 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2019, largely through exercising a portion of the forward contract entered into at the end of 2018.","Lastly, we plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt at our Iowa Utility later this year to fund our wind expansion program in Iowa. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our two utilities, consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We expect to refresh our future capital expenditure plans and disclose our 2020 financing plans including quantifying the 2020 new common equity needs during our third quarter earnings call in November.","Lastly, we\u2019ve included our 2019 regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5. There have been two key developments to share with you since our last quarterly earnings call. First, our Wisconsin utility filed its retail electric fuel, the rate review in June. To set the fuel cost monitoring level for 2020. Second, the rate reviews in Iowa continue to advance through their procedural schedules. As a reminder, we found electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa in March and implemented electric interim rates at the beginning of the second quarter. The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind project. Enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. A portion of the increase due to these investments has been offset with the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind projects being passed on to our customers beginning in April. This rate review filing also included the first forward-looking test year for Iowa Utility for 2020. The rate review proceeding is progressing according to plan. Yesterday, many of the 15 interveners in IPL\u2019s electric rate review proceedings filed direct testimony. We are still reviewing the details of the testimony. The Iowa business energy coalitions testimony and methodology appears generally consistent with our future test years are constructed and implied in other jurisdictions. Although, we have different viewpoints with some of their inputs and the end result, the Office of Consumer Advocate in contrast, has proposed a complicated and unique phased approach effectively applying future and historic elements within one test year, which we believe is inconsistent with the Iowa legislation.","Interveners have raised issues with the proposed renewable energy writer ROE and capital structure PTC carry forwards and other topics. Divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the rate reviews and we are generally unsurprised by the interveners positions. We are proud of the investments that we\u2019ve made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits for the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues.","On Slide 6, we provided the procedural schedules for the Iowa retail, electric and gas dockets to help you monitor the progress of these rate reviews throughout the remainder of 2019. Under Iowa statutes rate reviews must generally be decided within 10-months therefore we anticipate final orders in both the electric and gas rate reviews by year-end.","We appreciate your continued interest in our company. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. For members of the investment community, Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the 1-hour timeframe for this morning\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Darius [Indecipherable] on for Julian. I just wanted to briefly touch on the Iowa intervenor testimony that you mentioned a minute ago. Are there any specific read throughs that you can share as far as ROE, equity needs or the renewable writer at this time?","Robert Durian","Yes. This is Robert. Yes. Maybe just to summarize a couple of the positions, so for the ROEs, really there is two primary intervenors that had provided. I call the full revenue requirements testimony. One is the OCA and the other is IBAC is the term we use for them. Both of them are roughly around 9%. I think one was 8.9% and the other was 9.2%. And then from a capital structure. I believe the OCA proposed a 47% equity ratio and then IBAC was a 50% equity ratio. And then on the renewable writer, the renewable writer neither one of them had supported our position. So, we are working with them in the next few weeks or to see if we can gain alignment there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you. And just one follow-up, any commentary as far as pursuing multi-year rate cases in the future?","Robert Durian","Yes, generally speaking, I don\u2019t think anybody in these intervenors, testimony supported that. So again, we\u2019ll be working with them over the course of the next few weeks into the next year probably to try and figure out, it will support us at longer time frame than the one year that we\u2019re currently pursuing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning everybody.","Susan Gille","Hi.","Robert Durian","Good morning.","John Larsen","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","You mentioned you\u2019re trending toward the high end of guidance, does that reflect a $0.02 benefit from the high July weather and\/or expenses from the storms that John mentioned or does that assume normal weather for since June 30?","John Larsen","Yes. Andrew, this is John. It does include both of those items.","Robert Durian","Yes, just maybe Andrew, for the year, we picked up $0.05 in the first quarter from weather we loss $0.02 in the second quarter from weather and then we\u2019re expecting to pick another $0.02 up in July. So, year-to-date through July, we\u2019re about $0.05 ahead of plan as a result of weather impacts on temperatures. As far as the storm itself that John referred to, we don\u2019t expect any significant impact on earnings as a result of that. So that really puts us like I said around $0.05 ahead of plan right now.","Andrew Weisel","Very good. Next question, I know you update and roll forward the CapEx forecast in November. I think you mentioned that in the remarks as well. I\u2019m hoping we can get some kind of a sneak peek here. In the past you\u2019ve been pretty consistently increasing CapEx guidance for the near-term years. Should we expect that again or might there be other limiting factors being affordability or the balance sheet or whatever?","Robert Durian","Like I said, Andrew will be prepared to talk about that in more detail when we issue that information in early November and then go into a fair amount of discussion with a lot of the analysts and during our AI Finance Conference in early November.","Andrew Weisel","Fair enough. I\u2019ll have to be a bit more patient, I guess. Then, lastly, if I can squeeze a third one in. A lot of your neighbors in Wisconsin are taking the approach of combining efforts still own larger solar farm sites benefits like economies, scale, et cetera. And I know you have joint ownership of a natural gas plants, though I do remember the history behind that as well. Is this showing effort approach something that you might consider in the future. I know your near-term plans are pretty locked and loaded for renewables, but over time, should we think that you will continue to build your own assets or might you, combined with other utilities in your states?","John Larsen","Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew, this is John. It certainly all of those options will be on the table. We\u2019ve had a solid track record of some of our individual owning and operating, but partnerships with others is certainly possibility as well.","Andrew Weisel","Alright. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We can now take our next question from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Sullivan","Hey, good morning.","Robert Durian","Good morning.","John Larsen","Good morning.","Michael Sullivan","Just circling back to one of the questions, I was asked on the rate case, just given the recommendations that were given on equity ratio. And just the spread relative to what you\u2019re asking. I guess what kind of gives you guys, the level of comfort that will be needed to give equity plans in with the Q3 update?","Robert Durian","Yes. Michael, right now, what we\u2019re planning on doing. I would say over there probably matter of maybe eight weeks or so. We\u2019ll be working closely with the intervenors to try and identify opportunities for us to align on settlements parameters. So, right now the procedural schedule provides for some additional rebuttal testimony between the different intervenors and then we have a, dates in later September were any agreements that we reached before we get to the hearing process we file as part of a settlement notice. So we\u2019ll be working closely with the intervenors over, like I said, a matter of, the next few weeks to try and figure out how we can gain more alignments on those types of issues as well as how the other issues that have been filed as part of the testimony. So, we\u2019ve, had a really long history of engaging in these collaborative processes with interested parties. And so, what we believe in the merits of our case though we\u2019re looking forward to try and figure out some collaboration to reach alignment on some of these issues before we get to the hearing.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. And yes, just I mean, kind of given what you said on the history and what you\u2019ve seen from yesterday\u2019s filings would kind of be relatively in line with what you would have expected, and that\u2019s something like too far at a whack that would take settlement possibilities off the table?","Robert Durian","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment. Nothing that we saw in yesterday\u2019s testimony was unexpected at this point. It\u2019s a normal part of the process. So, like I said, we\u2019ll be working with them closely over the next few weeks to try and gain alignment before we get to the hearing.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, thanks. And then my last one, just also kind of tied to the rate case, but also just thinking longer-term about your generation needs in the like how, so once you get through this upcoming wind program, particularly in Iowa, how tight is \u2013 is there an opportunity for more beyond that. When do you start thinking about that and how tight is it to the renewables writer that they\u2019re asking for in the case?","John Larsen","Yes, Michael, this is John. We certainly see some opportunity for additional grid investments on the heels of the great renewable portfolio that we\u2019re putting forward right now. So, I would see that being a little more in the center of our next investment cycle for IPL.","Michael Sullivan","Okay.

I will then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our first quarter results as well review our regulatory calendar. Like the utilities in the region mild with the temperatures reduced first quarter results, ours by $0.05 per share. This is quite the opposite from first quarter 2015 where we experienced a positive temperature impact to earnings therefore temperature swings led to a significant quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.09 per share.","During the past few years we have been executing on our plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet and economic manner to serve our customers. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity, is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas fired and renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation through coal unit retirements and installing emission controls on performance upgrades on largest coal fired facilities.","We have also started water and ash program at our facilities to meet current and expected future environmental requirements. Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2016 is another very active construction year with 4 investments of over $1.1 billion. Our investments are projected to include approximately $300 million for our elective distribution systems. These investments are driven by customer expectations to make our systems more robust, reliable and resilient.","This year's plan also includes $200 million for improvements in expansion of our natural gas distribution business almost double our year spending. The electric and gas distribution business will continue to be a focus for future investments as we create a smarter energy infrastructure. Now I will provide an over view of our drilling, investments and gas power generation. As you are aware the Public Sewage Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the river side expansion.","And we expect to receive the written order today. We have already received the air permits and are awaiting approval for the water permits. We expect the asset from the new river side units to be approximately 700 MW and the total anticipated capital expenditure for river side remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission.","The targeted in service state is by early 2020. Later this month we plan to announce the engineering procurement and construction firms selected for this project. In Iowa the Marshalltown natural gas fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 73% complete. Total CapEx is anticipated to be approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission.","Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in spring 2017. Riverside and Emery are two primary existing gas generating facilities, had another quarter of significant increase in dispatch when compared to prior years. During the first quarter of 2016 Riverside's and Emery's were more than double their five year averages.","The ability to lean on our gas generation during periods of low gas prices results in fuel savings of our customers and shows the importance of a balanced energy mix.","Moving on to our existing coal field, we are getting towards the end of our successful construction program to reduce emissions at our largest facility. At Edgewater Unified, we continue on the installation of backhouse. This project is approximately 97% complete and is on time and below budget and should be in service later this year.","Total CapEx for these projects are anticipated to be $270 million. And last month construction of the Columbia Unit II SCR began. EPL's total CapEx anticipated to be approximately $50 million and is expected to go in service in 2018. There are several new order and ash regulations being developed by the environmental protection agency which we anticipate will impact 9 of our generating facilities both located across Iowa and Wisconsin.","Our water and ash program was designed according to EPA and DNR rules and regulations. We have ash plant closers and bottom ash conversions underway in Iowa as IPLs filed commission plan and budget. In Wisconsin we filed an application for the certificate of authority for bottom ash conversion for Edgewater. The total expenditures for our water and ash programs are anticipated to be over $200 million over the next 7 years.","The estimates provided in our investor release presentation include the near term expenditures for this program. As we plan for future generation needs we aim to minimize impacts while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We believe that our current emissions will continue to decrease due to the transition of our generating fleet, the availability of lower natural gas prices and increase of renewable energy.","We have continued to invest in and purchase renewable energy. We currently own 568MW of wind generation and purchased approximately 470MW of energy from renewable sources. Our 10 year capital plan includes additional investments to meet customer energy needs. Also we have several solar projects from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on our best to integrate solar in a cost effective manner into our electric system.","At our headquarters over 1300 solar panels have been installed and they are now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill which is adjacent to riverside. In Iowa construction has started on the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels there.","We also anticipate collecting additional solar investment opportunities in the near future. Listen to our customers and understand their evolving needs is shaping the path for the future. We have replaced our decade old customer information and billing system which is now providing customers of now many more online self service offerings and robust customer communication options.","And we have plans to ramp up additional offerings with this new platform. We are managed our company well and have made great strides growing for our company on behalf of our investors, customers and employees. In fact, our stock price doubled between yearend 2010 and into the first quarter of this year. As recognition of this progress and the growth prospects going forward the Board of Director's announced a two form stock split last month.","Each share on record on the close of business on May 4 will receive one additional share for every outstanding common share held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed on May 19 and May 20 shares will be sold at the post-split price. This is a significant milestone that our company and investors should be proud of. Let me summarize today, we will work to deliver 2016 operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target.","Our target 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend. Successful execution of our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at a below budget in a very safe manner, working with the regulators and customers and utilities in a collaborative manner, reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster while keeping our focus on our customers and being good partners in the community.","We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and impacts to customers. You are invited to join us at our annual meeting next week which will be held on May 13 in Wisconsin. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Good morning everyone, we released first quarter 2016 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.86 per share which was $0.01 per share lower than 2015 earnings. a summary of the quarter over quarter earning's drivers may be found on Slide 3. Consistent with our growth assumed in our 2016 earning's guidance retail electric and temperature normalized sales for Iowa, Wisconsin increased to approximately 1% between first quarter 2015 and 2016.","The commercial and industrial sectors continued to be the largest hales growth drivers quarter-over-quarter. Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 - $3.90 on a pre-stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings led to infrastructure investments such as the Edgewater and the Lansing emission control equipment. And hire AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station. The earing's guidance is based upon the impacts of IPLs and WPLs previously announced retail based rate settlement.","In 2016 IPL expects to credit customer builds by approximately $10 million. By comparison the building credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL expects to provide tax driver billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. Over the years the tax benefit riders may have a timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results.","The WPL settlement reflected electric growth for the Edgewater house projected to be place in service this year. The increase in requirements in 2016 for this and other base additions completely offset by lower energy efficiency recovery amortization.","Slide 4 has been provided to assist you in modeling the assisted tax rates in IPL and WPL and AEC. Turning to our forecasted capital expenditures. In March, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration announced proposed regulations to update the safer requirements for gas pipeline. We currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017. The forecasted capital expenditures provided during our year-end call include estimated amounts for this expected regulations.","Now turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deduction through 2019. As a result of the 5 year bonus depreciation Alliant Energy does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carry forward positions as well as future mounted bonus depreciation expected to be taken under federal income tax returns over the next 5 years.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong. Given their earnings generated by business. We believe that with strong cash flows and financing plan we will maintain our target liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit rating. 2016 financing plans will soon be issued in approximately $25 million of our new common equity through our share to direct plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing the long term debt of up to $300 million of IPL and approximately $400 million of parent Alliant Energy resources.","We added $10 million to the proceeds at the energy resources are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans. As we look beyond 2016 our equity needs will be driven by riverside expansion project, our forecast assumes that Capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of common activity.","We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and our debt needs continue to be reassessed. We have several current and planned regulatory redactors of note of 2016 and 2017 which we have summarized in Slide 5. During the second quarter this year we anticipate filing a WPL retail electric and gas case for the 2017 and 2018 rates.","For IPL we expect decision regarding permit application for approximately $60 million in natural gas pipeline. Iowa and retail electric and gas based cases are expected to be filed in the first half of 2017. We very much appreciate the continued support of your company.","At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hanson. At this time the company will open the call for question for members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management team will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Andrew Levi at Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Hi, first question.","Susan Gille","Good morning Andy, congratulations.","Andrew Levi","Thank you. What do I get for anything or?","Pat Thompson","Nothing.","Andrew Levi","Just a quick question. Just on the non-reg, where was the breakdown on the earnings on the non-reg on the quarter?","Pat Thompson","Yes, the railroad and train facility.","Tom Hanson","I think the transportation $0.01 and our non-reg generation was another $0.01. Franklin County was a drag of about $0.01 and then we had activity of about another penny. Last time it was a positive in terms of the other benefits of the parent.","Andrew Levi","Okay and how did the Franklin, the non-reg generation and the railroad, how did that compare to last year?","Tom Hanson","I would say it's fairly consistent.","Andrew Levi","Okay and then just in general on Franklin and the railroads. What's kind of the thinking of the outlook this year relative to last year?","Tom Hanson","I think with Franklin last November when we gave guidance we said it would probably be a drag on earnings of about $0.04 to $0.05. And that is still reasonable, yes.","Andrew Levi","And on the railroad?","Tom Hanson","And assume $0.07 was our current outlook, current forecast we are assuming the same expectations for 2016.","Andrew Levi","$0.07 to the railroad. Is that what the railroad earned in 2015 or was it higher or lower?","Tom Hanson","No it was $0.07 last year as well.","Andrew Levi","Got it, that's all I needed. Thank you very much.","Operator","We move next to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","Hi, good morning. You reaffirmed your 5% to 7%, does that run through a particular year or through a particular planning periods? Maybe you could just talk about that just a little bit.","Pat Thompson","Yes, Brian we actually based it on last year's weather normalized sales and it goes on for 5 years so till 2019.","Brian Russo","Okay and what was last year's weather normalized sales?","Pat Thompson","$3.57","Brian Russo","Okay. And just remind us the Riverside settlement and options from communities to grow up and energy, just remind us of the timing of that?","Susan Gille","Yes, Brian we updated our Investor Deck so if you got to Slide 9 on the Deck, basically the Wisconsin public service has the option for up to 200 MW in the 2024 timeframe. MG&E has up to 50 MW from the 2020 to 2025 timeframe and the co-op have up to 60 MW and they will determine that in the quarter this year.","Brian Russo","And how is that priced?","Susan Gille","Current book value at the time.","Brian Russo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Moving next to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Good morning, appreciate the commentary on potential equity meets for next year. Just want to understand is that sort of a run rate we should assume for all years in 2017 and beyond or is it sort of a onetime thing? Obviously there's other variables that could make the need go up and down but should we think of that as the number for the next several years or 2017 and there could be more 2018?","Tom Hanson","Assume that as the initial estimate for 2017 and in terms of the outer years. It's going to be somewhat depended on the some of the parties just made reference to, in terms of the Riverside expansion so if and when MG&E might step into Riverside so for now assume up to $150 million applies to only till 2017.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Great and the other one there was some change to the effective tax rate forecast in the Slide Deck, I believe and want to confirm. That's earning as neutral and that offsets right to revenue line or is that something that could effectively shake out within the guidance range?","Tom Hanson","There will be some movement with the income statements. What has changed is principally an IPL which will have a less low through benefit. But that could not be impacting earnings. That will be offset someplace else.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. That cancelled the effect of tax rate so both IPL and corporation, I should think of it as neutral?","Tom Hanson","No, think of it as lien adjustment tax and something else will be offsetting it so the earnings guidance will remain consistent with previous estimates.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So the $0.09 benefit in the full year guidance is still a good number to think about?","Tom Hanson","A little bit high but it is not going to be significantly high and will be offset by something else so far, guidance for 2016 is unchanged.","Pat Thompson","We know how carefully you guys track the tax rate so we want to provide the update this quarter.","Andrew Weisel","Yes, appreciate it was just trying to understand the potential impact of the bottom line. Thank you.","Pat Thompson","And Tom counts every penny also.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call. A replay will be available through May 12, 2016 at 888-203-1112 for U.S. & Canada or 719-457-0820 for international. Callers should reference conference ID 8244179.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy. Please go ahead.","Susan Gille ","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer as well as other members of the senior management team.","Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy's year end 2012 earnings, and affirmed 2013 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.",".","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review the year end 2012 results. I am pleased to report that 2012 was a year that Alliant Energy employees should be proud of and investors should be pleased with. Not only that we deliver solid financial results but we also make noteworthy improvements in reliability, customer service, generation availability and safety. Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees and 2012 was our safest year on record.","Reportable injuries decreased 39% and loss-time accidents decreased 36%. I am very proud of our collective focus and commitment to make sure our employees go home safely each and every day.  Let\u2019s start with our financial results. ","As we have previously discussed the hot summer weather certainly contributed to higher earnings in 2012. However excluding the impact of weather our non-GAAP 2012 earnings were 5% higher than the same measure for 2011 and the midpoint of our 2013 earnings guidance is forecasted to result in a weather normalized growth of 6% of a calendar year 2012. This is consistent with our five year, 5% to 7% weather-normalized long term earnings growth objective. We are updating our base year for our long term growth to the 2013 non-GAAP weather-normalized earnings of $2.93 per share.","We also increased our common dividend to $1.88 per share annually which is the 4% increase over the 2012 dividend rate. Our long term objective is to maintain the targeted dividend in the rage of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings.","2012 was also one of the largest capital deployment years in the company history totaling $1.2 billion. Included in this capital was the acquisition of the Riverside Energy Center, completion of the Franklin County wind farm, the installation of the SCR Edgewater Unit 5 and the beginning of construction of baghouses and scrubbers at our Ottumwa and Columbia facilities.","Construction is proceeding well at these facilities and also at MidAm's Neal three and four units. The expected in-service dates for most of these environmental controls is 2014 but the new four projects will be in service later this year.","In 2012, we also deployed approximately $200 million in our electric and gas distribution system and continue to see the reliability improvements from our investments.","On the regulatory front, we recently received the IUB\u2019s order of the new 11 year DAEC PPA which is effective with the expiration of the current contract in February 2014. All costs of the new DAEC PPA will flow through the energy adjustment cost.","Issues were raised in the docket about the potential double recovery of the capacity cost if IPO does not file a new base rate case in 2014. Since the $135 million of DAEC capacity payments were included in 2009 base rates which was the last base rate case and starting in February 2014, all DAEC payments will flow through the energy adjustment clause.","The IUB acknowledges IPL\u2019s commitment to work with consumer advocate and large customer groups to resolve this issue before the EAC tariff changes. However, if the parties cannot resolve this issue, IPL will file a general rate case proceeding in the first quarter of 2014 along with the refund obligation with an effective date of the DAEC agreement of February 22, 2014. Any required refund is based upon the IUB\u2019s final rate order in late 2014 and applied retroactively to February 22, 2014.","We would like to extend the current three year base rate freeze that expires at the end of this year until the proposed Marshalltown generating plant is placed in service which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2017. We are developing a rate stabilization plan that we will avoid the news for multi-year rate cases and eliminate base rate volatility for our customers. To stabilize rates for our electric customers during the 2014 through March 2017 time period we will propose using the remaining funds available from the tax benefit rider.","At the end of 2013 there will be an additional $230 million available to refund to electric customers. We remain committed and look forward to working with the Office of Consumer Advocate, industrial groups and other interested parties to reach agreement on a rate stabilization plan by February 2014. If a rate stabilization agreement cannot not be reached, the base rate case filed at early 2014 would include the recovery and return on rate base additions of approximately $500 million and other changes in revenue requirements since our 2009 test year case.","We also anticipate that we would likely need additional rate cases before 2017 since electric rate base is expected to increase in late 2014 and 2015. As we have discussed in the past the DAEC capacity payments in base rates would offset the increase in revenue requirements.","In November 2012 IPL filed applications with the Utilities Board, for advanced rate making principles and site approvals for the proposed Marshalltown generating plant. Our proposed advanced rate making principles include a fixed cost cap of $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission upgrades. ","And to return on common equity 11.25% with no application of double leverage. We expect a decision from the IUB by the end of this year. And we have included the regulatory milestones related to these filings and supplemental slide nine for reference. One of the milestones is intervener testimony which is scheduled to be filed today. ","In July 2012, we filed the construction authorization request with the PSCW for a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater 5. We are expecting a deficient from the PSCW on these matters soon after the hearing on March 5th. Construction of this approximately $410 million project is expected to begin in 2014 and to be completed in 2016.","In Wisconsin, we participated in transmission through our 16% increase in ATC. MISO's Transmission Owner Agreement requires that a project running between the facilities of two transmission owning members must be shared equally unless the parties agree otherwise. ","In recent rulings, FERC has directed ATC to negotiate conditions for the shared ownership for two projects. One with ITC and the other was Xcel. 2015 will be the first year we would see any impact to earnings generated from our ATC ownership if appeals are unsuccessful and of other projects in do not fill a part or all of the void left in the capital expenditure plan as a result of these FERC decisions.","Let me summarize the key messages for today. We will continue to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will make a great progress, transforming our generation portfolio to one that is balanced with lower emissions and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations. We are focused on working safely, providing excellent customer service and improving reliability.","And finally, we will manage our company focusing on operational and financial discipline with the goal of earning our authorized returns while minimizing customer rate volatility and increases.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","","Good morning, everyone. Today we released our 2012 non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.05 per share, which is a $0.10 per share increase over 2011 non-GAAP results. ","The growth in non-GAAP earnings is primarily a result of income taxes at IPL due to tax planning strategies, lower operations and maintenance expenses. Higher WPL retail fuel recoveries and higher AFUDC related to emission control projects. ","The positive EPS drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher capacity charges for nuclear purchase power agreements and record warm weather in the first quarter negatively impacting electric gas sales.","2012 weather resulted in positive earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.04 lower than 2011, weather impact of $0.16 per share. Comparisons between 2012 and 2011 earnings per share are detailed on supplemental slides 2, 3 and 4. The 2012 results reflect no material changes in weather normalized sales over 2011 and in 2013 we are forecasting no material changes in weather normalized sales or 2012. Sales trends between 2011 and 2012 weather normalized actual and 2013 estimate are illustrated on supplemental slide 5.","The electric tax benefit rider resulted in no earnings impact for 2012, just like it had no earnings impact in 2011. The actual quarterly earnings impact of the 2012 electric tax benefit rider as well as the projected quarterly earnings impact of the 2013 electric and gas tax benefit riders are provided in supplemental slide 6.","Turning to our financing plan, cash flows from operations are expected to stay strong since we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2015, and the 2013 cash flows will be impacted partially due to the credits to customer billed in accordance with IPLs tax benefit riders. Due to our current net operating loss position the extension of bonus depreciation is not expected to impact your financing plans prior 2015. With the extension of the bonus depreciation, we project approximately $150 million of cash in 2015. Also, if you look at bonus depreciation in isolation, we are forecasting a reduction of a previously released rate base estimates by approximately 20 million and 60 million in 2014 and 2015 respectively. These forecasted rate base amounts are projected to be evenly split between IPL and WPL.","Last week we announced the redemption of IPLs 150 million, 8 and 3\/8 preferred stock. Our current 2013 financing plan anticipates issuing long term debt and or preferred stock up to $500 million at IPL. Yesterday we announced the redemption of WPL's $60 million of preferred stock. We currently have no plans to replace the preferred stock at WPL. The impacts of these financings is included in the 2013 guidance. However the onetime charges related to the redemption are excluded from our 2013 guidance. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratio and credit metrics. Therefore we do not plan to issue any material new common equity in 2013. ","We will continue to assess our future common equity needs based on their pending regulatory approvals for the Edgewater 5 scrubber baghouse and Marshalltown generating plant which we expect later this year. Let's review our 2013 guidance range of $2.95 to $2.25 per share, a walk from the 2012 non-GAAP weather normalized actuals to the 2013 estimated guidance midpoint is shown on supplemental slide 7. The 2013 guidance assumes normal weather, continued cost controls and approval from the IUB for the proposed $0.13 per share revenue requirement adjustment associated with the electric tax benefit rider, the 2013 guidance also reflects the impacts of WPL\u2019s previously announced retail rate freeze and gas rate decrease and IPL\u2019s base rate freeze and settlement of its gas rate case.","The WPL rate freeze reflected electric rate-base growth as a result of the Riverside acquisition and placing the Edgewater 5 SCR in service at the end of 2012. The increase in electric revenue requirement for 2013 from these rate-base additions was completely offset by the impact of lower purchased power capacity cost from the Riverside PPA and the lower conservation expense resulting in no change to WPL's retail electric customers base rate in 2013.","However, WPL expects increased earnings from the reduction in purchased power capacity and conservation costs. The 2013 guidance also reflect a decrease in rates from the reduction in WPL's base rates effective January first of this year. Our 2013 guidance range forecasts WPL earning its authorized return of 10.4%.","Now, let\u2019s turn our focus to IPL. IPL is in the last year of its current electric base-rate freeze. We forecast IPL to benefit from the proposed increase in electric revenues due to the proposed revenue requirement adjustment from the electric tax benefit rider, expected higher AFUDC from its environmental controls currently under construction and continued cost controls. These benefits are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation expense.","Our 2013 guidance range forecasts, IPL earning is slightly less than its authorized return on common equity of approximately 10%. ","As stated in our third quarter 2012 call, IPL\u2019s revenue requirement adjustment proposed for 2013 under the tax benefit rider is based upon tax planning strategies which lead to the establishment of the electric tax benefit rider. If we had followed traditional rate making practices in IPL\u2019s last electric rate case, these tax planning strategies would have reduced customer rates due to the tax benefits generated and increased customer rates due to the rate base impact from the changes in deferred taxes resulting in a net decrease in customer rates.","Due to the materiality and uncertainty of these tax planning strategies, the IUB issued a 2010 accounting order to temporarily suspend the traditional Iowa ratemaking practices until IRS certainty was reached. In 2012, we have reached agreement with IRS on the benefits of these strategies through 2011 tax year. Thus, IPL submitted a proposal to the IUB in November 2012 to finalize the impact for the strategies in two ways.","First, IPL proposed the final amount of the tax benefits from the IRS audit of these strategies to be reflected in the regulatory liability account available for tax benefit riders. At the end of the 2013, IPL expects to have approximately $265 million remaining in the regulatory liability account. Second, the increase to electric rate base is proposed as reduction to the regulatory liability account resulting in a $0.13 of additional earnings in 2013 as illustrated on supplemental slide seven.","We anticipate a decision from the IUB in this matter before the end of the first quarter of this year. Given the changes expected in income taxes in 2013, supplemental slide eight has been provided to assist you in modeling our forecasted 2013 effective tax rates for WPL and AEC.","As you could see from the log, we are expecting lower effective tax rates in 2013 due to increased tax benefit rider billing credits and additional production tax credits.","Turning to our regulatory calendar, we have several regulatory dockets of note in 2013, in addition to our pursuit of a rate stabilization plan which are summarized on slide nine. We expect three noteworthy decisions from the IUB in 2013.","The first is a decision on the finalization of the electric tax benefit rider discussed earlier. The second relates to a decision regarding the settlements reached with the OCA related to the emissions plan and budget filings submitted by IPL and MidAm in April 2012. And the third is the construction authorization and rate-making principles for the purposed Marshalltown generating plant.","The hearing for the Marshalltown project is scheduled for May 21st. In Wisconsin, we expect a decision from the Public Service Commission Wisconsin during the first half of 2013 regarding the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse project. The hearing from this project is scheduled for March 5th. We very much appreciate continued support of our company. At this time I will turn back to you operator to facilitate the question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from John Ali with Decade Capital.","John Ali - Decade Capital","I was wondering your CAGR is 5 to 7%, what is the new base and how many years of that expand you.","Susan Gille","","Sure at the beginning of the call we mentioned that the new base of the 2012 non-GAAP revised earnings so that number is $2.93 per share and we should go out five years and its five years.","Operator","","Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","","I apologize but if you could just run through the impacts of bonus depreciation again at the two utilities that would be helpful.","Susan Gille","Yes, Brian we are going to see the cash benefit in 2015 and that's because of our annual NOL. However we will see a rate base reduction in 2014 and 2015 of 20 and $60 million. So if we would just look at that in isolation that's what we would see In terms of the rate base reduction compared to the information we've previously shared.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","But the cash for the tax benefit of about $150 million.","Susan Gille","We will be receiving that in 2015.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","So $150 million of cash benefit in the cash flow statement in 2015 and then the $20 and $60 million in '14, '15 rate base adjustments are split evenly between the two utilities?","Tom Hanson","That is correct.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","So, when we look at your total rate base of 5.6 billion or so this bonus depreciation seems to be fairly immaterial. ","","Tom Hanson","That is correct.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","The Marshalltown review approval process, can you just comment on the RFP process that I think has concluded?","Susan Gille","There is two RFPs processes so I apologize if I go back in history a little bit. We recently did an RFP process to see if there was a better alternative to the market Marshalltown facility and that's when the DAAC proposal was put on the table as well. There is another RFP process going on right now for the construction of the facility and that's still underway.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","","Okay, so do we have any details on the outcome of the first RFP on other alternatives?","Pat Kampling","","Yes and that's part of the - that'll be part of the case.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay so it's not public yet?","Pat Kampling","No.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, got you. And then lastly just the IPO rate stabilization plan that you're working on, any idea on the timing of when we might see a filing?","Pat Kampling","Brian, I wish I could give you timing at this point but we really can't. We'll be working with all the interested parties and make sure that we get to conclusion on this, but I don\u2019t want to commit some time frame at this point.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, so maybe second half of '13 type of filing?","Pat Kampling","We can't speculate at this point.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Andy Bischoff with Morningstar.","Andy Bischoff - Morningstar","Actually just kind of a clarifying question. Could you walk through again, your plans for redeeming the preferreds and the debt plans?","Tom Hanson","In IPL as I mentioned we did release a press release last week indicating that we were going to redeem all of the 150 million of outstanding preferreds and our financing plan at IPL includes an anticipated issuance, it's up to $500 million of long-term debt and or preferred stock in 2013. And at WPL we've issued the press release stating that we are redeeming that 60 million of preferred stock and is not our plan to replace the preferred stock at WPL. ","Operator","","We'll go next to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie ","My first question is, I just want to make sure I understood the comments around the potential rate cases. I understand you'd like to extend the rate freeze until Marshalltown comes into service, but that you may need to file a rate case about a year from now if things don\u2019t work the way you're hoping. Did I hear you say that you also might need additional rate cases between those two or would it be one or the other?","Pat Kampling","We would need to file a case a year from now and then likely file another case before 2017. So we would want to\u2026","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie ","Is it possible to have a multiyear plan instead of possibly three rate cases over 4 years?","Pat Kampling","That's why we considered a rate stabilization plan. Yes that's definitely our preference because we do not like the volatility on our customer's base rates.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie ","Okay, remind me the timing of when you would have an idea about that?","Pat Kampling","Yes, we'll be working on that this year. Again, Brian had the same question, I really can\u2019t commit to any time frame but we will need to get this done before, before February of 2014, but our goal would be to get something done this year. I just can\u2019t commit to a time frame at this point. ","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie ","Okay, fair enough, and then my only other question you mentioned no equity needs in 2013 in light of the 150 million of cash that you're expecting two years later, any thoughts on the longer term outlook for equity needs. I know it\u2019ll depend on approvals for Edge 5 and Marshalltown, but maybe some of the best case and worst case scenarios.","Tom Hanson","Certainly the bonus depreciation will help in that respect but as we get until we get the order from the public service commission here within Wisconsin relating to Edge 5 and the Marshalltown approval, it's premature at this time to be stating any specifics in terms of those future equity needs. But the point is the bonus depreciation certainly will help in that regard and as said, as we get those two orders which were expected this year we'll be able to add more clarity in terms of those potential future needs.","Operator","We go next to Eli Kraicer with Millennium Partners.","Eli Kraicer - Millennium Partners","Just had a question regarding the regulatory approval process for the CCGT, are there hearings coming in May regarding that, is that correct.","Pat Kampling","Yes, the testimony will be filed today and the hearing's on, if you look at schedule 9 in the attached slides hearing's on May 21st.","Eli Kraicer - Millennium Partners","Okay and how shall we think, is there any interrelation between the regulatory process regarding the approval for the rating parameters for the plan and how you will ultimately deal or discuss the post 2013 rates for IPL or the two issues at all related or how should we think about that.","Pat Kampling","Yes, you know Steve, we actually consider this our strategy so we are relating the issues, however we stated that the rate stabilization plan would like to go through on the date when the Marshalltown plant will be in service. So it will not be including a rate stabilization due to this facility itself, but up to that point.","Eli Kraicer - Millennium Partners","Okay, maybe I\u2019ll follow up offline on that.","Pat Kampling","Okay but we would expect to have to file a rate case in 2017 for the Marshalltown gas plant.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Just back on the rate stabilization plan, I think you had discussed your desire to possibly work out a settlement on this first going through a full proceeding, can you give us an update on whether talks have begun and kind of what\u2019s the status of that is at this point? I know it\u2019s early, but any information would be great?","Pat Kampling ","The information that I can provide is that the interested parties are well aware of our intentions here and the goal is to stabilize rates for our customers. I really cannot say much more than that at this point.","Operator","","And the next is Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann","","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Can you remind us of the amount and the timing of when that parent debt matures in 2014, the (inaudible) related?","Tom Hanson ","","Yes, it\u2019s October 2014.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, and what\u2019s the interest, what\u2019s the rate on that?","Tom Hanson ","4%.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","","And how much is it?","Tom Hanson","250 million.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, and where does that, kind of flow through the income statement. Is it in the other non-rank and parent classification?","Tom Hanson","Yes-yes.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille ","With no more questions, that concludes our call. A replay will be available through February 21, 2013 at 888-203-1112 for U.S. and Canada, or 719-457-0820 for international.

Following prepared remarks by Pat and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's Year End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results and affirmed the consolidated 2018 earnings guidance issued in November 2017. The press release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements.

In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our investor presentation, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia Kampling","Good morning and thank you for joining us. 2017 was another excellent year for our company and I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. On slide two, you'll notice that our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings of a $1.99 per share, a 6% higher than 2016's comparable number.","Also, I'm reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.11 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. Our forecasted long-term growth guidance through 2021 is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures and was also re-based of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings of $1.99 per share. This was the fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%.","Our robust capital plan during this time has helped us transition our generation fleet to and that achieve significant reductions in SOx, NOx, mercury and carbon, this made our grid stronger and more resilient. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the retirements of our smaller, less efficient fossil fuel generating stations and the start of our utility owned wind additions.","In 2017, we achieved some major milestones including a commercial operation of a 700 megawatt highly efficient natural gas-fired generating facility in Marshalltown Iowa. The start of construction of a similar unit at our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin and the announcement of our plant 1,200 megawatt wind addition.","In 2016, the Iowa utility board approved the first 500 megawatts of our 1,000 megawatt plant wind additions. In 2017, we initiated an advanced rate making principal docket for the second 500 megawatt. We expect a ruling on our quest for the second 500 megawatts in the coming weeks. Construction will soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm and we are making progress and acquiring additional wind sites to serve our Iowa customers.","Of the 1,000 megawatts we plan to build, our current forecast assumes 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts will be placed in service in 2020. For our Wisconsin customers, we signed agreements with our neighboring utilities to purchase wind energies Forward Wind Energy Center. Customers and Investors should both benefit as we transfer this wind farm to an existing purchase power agreement to utility owned.","This purchase has already been approved by the FERC and we anticipate closing the acquisition in the spring after receiving PSCW approval. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatt of additional wind investment for WPL.","We continue to analyze options to construct additional wind for Wisconsin customers. Our goal is to make the regulatory filing in the first half of 2018, we would expect approval by the end of the year. Our plan to add up to 1200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024. We've taken major steps in the transformation on a historic past into a future with many new possibilities.","We are closing Ash Pond at our coal plants and are starting turning those sites into beautiful ring gardens for productive pollinator habitats by incorporating native grasses and flowers. The largest sites have been designed to have solar panels installed on them in the future, and several of our retired coal plants have now been demolished so that the land can be restored and redeveloped for those communities.","One very exciting project in Wisconsin involves the BlackRock generating station. Beloit College has recently purchased it and is repurposing the decommissioned century-old coal plant into a state-of-the-art student center called the powerhouse. There will be a showcase of sustainable design and is illustration of the transformation from the early 20th century into the digital age.","As you are aware, we'll make decisions regarding the transition of our fuel sources, customer cost is always top of mind. We have seen the energy landscape change across the country where more cost renewables and cheaper and abundant natural gas had made some of the industries decades old traditional sources of energy uncompetitive. We find ourselves in that circumstance with the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa.","The purchase power agreement from DAEC expires at the end of 2025 and it appears that there will be more competitive options for our customers. So last month Nextera announced on their earnings call that they believed it is unlikely that we will extend the current DAEC PPA. We are currently analyzing our capacity and energy needs post 2025, we'll look for the most competitive options to serve our customers.","Before I turn the call over to Robert, I would like to mention that we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation and support of legislation. As our industry revolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. Iowa and Wisconsin are very focused on helping customers save money, while providing more opportunities for business growth and job-creation. We will continue to be proactive in our states to help shape energy policy, and advocate on behalf of our customers.","In closing, I'm excited about our achievements in 2017. We'll focus on the following goals for our company in 2018, complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner, continue our generation fuel transition with additional power supply retirements and development of our wind generation and the West Riverside Energy Center, deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2017 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share, which include the impacts of the recent Tax Reform Legislation. Tax Reform resulted in $0.08 per share of non-recurring earnings due to re-measuring deferred tax associated with our non-utility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax credit carry forwards.","Our 2017 results also included $0.02 per share non-recurring charge for the write-down of regulatory assets as a result of the settlement of IPL's retail electric rate review. Excluding these two non-recurring impacts and the $0.06 per share negative impact from the normal temperatures in 2017, our non-GAAP normal temperatures normalized earnings were $1.99 per share, which were in line with our expectation.","Please see the earnings walks provided on slides three, four and five of our supplemental slides for more details.","Excluding the impacts of milder temperatures in 2017 and the impacts related to leap year in 2016, we saw a slightly positive sales growth in our service territories year-over-year. We continue to see sales growth from industrial customers, offset by lower usage by residential customers, largely due to energy efficiency effort. The recently enacted Tax Reform Legislation provides a unique and historic opportunity for the company to provide material benefits to customers in both the short and long run.","We are working with our regulators on plans which provide our customers with near-term benefits from tax reform, while maintaining strong balance sheet. This will ensure our company continues to have access to capital at reasonable rates thereby reducing cost for our customers. We recently submitted proposals to our state regulators in Iowa and Wisconsin, which include a variety of options for customer benefits including customer billing credits, accelerated asset amortizations, deferral or avoidance of future rate cases and funding for future investments important to our customers.","We have provided a summary of our proposals on slide six. Consistent with the rest of our industry, tax reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer bills. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future that allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL in their most recent rate review.","The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on Tax Reform benefit. Our equity over the next couple of years will continue to be driven by our utilities robust capital expenditure plans including the wind expansion program and the construction of the West Riverside generating facility. We do not anticipate any changes to the 2018 financing plan we shared last November, which included up to $200 million of new common equity and additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance.","We've also updated our estimated future tax payments as a result of Tax Reform. Alliant Energy now does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2024 with additional tax payment reductions after 2024 due to wind investments included in our plan.","These estimates are based on current federal net operating losses and credit carry forward position, as well as future amounts of accelerated depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.","Turning to this year's earnings guidance, our 2018 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged. The earnings guidance by reporting company and our walk between 2017 adjusted EPS and 2018 EPS guidance is on slide seven. Slide eight has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of Tax Reform and the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018.","Also note that our 2018 earnings guidance assumes ATC Investment earnings and an ROE of 10.2% effective once FERC issues its decision on the second MISO ROE complaint, which is currently expected sometime during the first half of 2018.","Lastly, we've included our regulatory targets of note for 2018 on slide nine. These current and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial result. In summary, our employees delivered solid financial and operational results for our customers and share owners in 2017.","Key items of note include, the Marshalltown Generating Station completed on time and under budget and approved settlement in the IPL retail electric rate review, significant progress with the expansion of wind generation and cost controls for the benefit of our customers, while we delivered on our earnings commitment to share owners.","We are looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us in 2018 and believe it will be another successful year for our customers, our share owners and our employees. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the upcoming conference. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conference and supplemental materials available on our website.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time the company will open up the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions]","And we'll take our first question from Nick Campanella from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Campanella","Hey, good morning. Congrats on a successful year.","Patricia Kampling","Good morning, Nick. How are you?","Nicholas Campanella","Good. How are you? I was just curious on your comments for additional equity. Could there be any changes to your consolidated cap structure, I think there was a targeted 40% to 45% ratio discussed on the 3Q call. So is there any changes to that?","Robert Durian","No, we're going to stay with that plan.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it. And I understand the dockets are ongoing, but is there kind of a base case number that we should be thinking about for '18 or '19 as things change there?","Patricia Kampling","You're talking about sort of rate review, I'm sorry, we don't understand your question.","Nicholas Campanella","I'm sorry. The tax reform dockets that are ongoing in your jurisdictions, and I know that the cash flow impacts will be dependent on how those cases play out, but is there kind of a base case on how to think about the equity number?","Robert Durian","Yeah, from an equity prospective, we're obviously sharing with you what we're doing in 2018 with no plan changes at this point. We were going to continue to evaluate what the regulatory decisions are. At this point, we're expecting a decision from both of the two major jurisdictions probably sometime in the second quarter following that, as well as any additional information we learn about our capital expenditure plan through the decision we're waiting for the wind plan. We'll probably have some information I would guess in a month or two to give you some more clarity as to what our equity needs look like beyond that at that frame.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it. Thanks so much. See you next week.","Patricia Kampling","Bye Nick.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Andy Levy with Avon Capital Please go ahead.","Andrew Levy","How are you doing?","Patricia Kampling","Hi, Andy. How are you?","Robert Durian","Good morning.","Andrew Levy","I'm doing fine, thank you very much. The equity, when you will update us on that? I missed that.","Robert Durian","Probably sometime later this year, Andy. We obviously need some additional information regarding what the regulators are going to decide on the Tax Reform benefits from the timing and method which they are going to go back to the customers. And then also, we want to have more clarity on the capital expenditure plan which we're hoping to get here in the next few weeks regarding the second 500 megawatts of the wind in Iowa.","Patricia Kampling","But, Andy, we don't expect any changes for 2018 financing plan. This will be post 2018.","Andrew Levy","Right. And obviously we're in effective growth rate longer term as well?","Robert Durian","That is correct. Yeah, right now as we disclosed on slide six of the supplemental slides, we see some I would say modestly accretive impact of Tax Reform on our earnings, but not enough for us to change the 5% to 7% through 2021. And that's largely centered around, we do like most utilities we're going to see some additional rate base growth, but we also see some additional equity needs and therefore they offset each other.","Andrew Levy","Got it. And then the other question is, I noticed there was about a month ago, you guys changed your bylaws, could you just go over the thinking on that?","Patricia Kampling","Sure. What we did, Andy, was we redeemed our posion pill. We've been receiving some criticism on our governance scores over the last couple of years, because we still had a poison pill out there that was not approved by share owners and of course is not in favor. So that's what we did. We just redeemed the poison pill, just to get in line with other S&P 500 companies. We were an outlier on that one.","Andrew Levy","Okay. That was my question. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Gregg Orrill from UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yes. Thank you.","Patricia Kampling","Good morning, Greg.","Gregg Orrill","Good morning. Two questions. One, what is it that you're looking to learn that would modify your CapEx plan with regard to Iowa wind decision? And then what is the process that you're looking at in Wisconsin to transfer the wind into the utility?","Patricia Kampling","Sure, so two questions. First, we just want to get the official RPU docket approved. So our CapEx plan assumes that will be approved, so that's our assumption. We'll expect to know, we believe in a couple of weeks. So we don't believe there is going to be any changes, we just want to make sure that's final before we communicate more on the financing plan post 2018. And the docket in Wisconsin for the - wind farm is actually in process. And we should expect approval of that in a couple of weeks. Bob, you want to add something?","Robert Durian","No.","Patricia Kampling","Did that answer your question?","Patricia Kampling","Yeah, I think it did, yep, appreciate it.","Patricia Kampling","Okay, okay.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

Good morning and thank you for joining us for our yearend earnings call.","I'll begin with an overview of 2015 performance and then provide an update on our forecasted capital expenditures and rate base. I'll also share the progress made in transforming our generation fleet, modernizing our electric system and expanding our natural gas system.","I'll then turn the call over to Tom to provide details on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance as well as review our regulatory calendar.","I am pleased to report we've had another solid year achieving a $3.57 midpoint of our November 2015 guidance range when adding back to negative temperature impact of $0.08 per share to the non-GAAP earnings of $3.49 per share.","Our 2015 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings reflect an increase of over 5% from comparable 2014 earnings as shown on Slide 2. The temperatures of late 2015 did impact our actual yearend results.","For the first 10 months of 2015, our financial results were basically temperature neutral, but the one winter we experienced, especially in December resulted in a negative $0.08 per share variance in 2015 earnings.","This was quite the opposite for 2014 where we experienced a $0.09 per share positive variance to earnings. Therefore, temperature swings did lead to a significant year-over-year variance of $0.17 per share.","We also issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2016 through 2019, totaling $5 billion as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2016 to 2019 capital expenditure plan to our current plan on Slide 4.","As you can see, the $260 million increase in our forecasted 2016 through 2019 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily from accelerated investments from our electric and gas distribution systems.","The December 2015 extension of bonus depreciation for certain investments through 2019 has given us the opportunity to bring forward some infrastructure projects that will benefit our customers for years to come.","I do want to point out that with this revised capital plan, we expect no material change to the rate base forecast that we provided last November for IPL and WPL through 2018. We anticipate the increase in forecasted capital expenditures will offset the impact resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation.","During the past few years, we've been executing on a plan for the orderly transition of our generation fleet in an economical manner to serve our customers. We made significant progress in building a generation portfolio that have lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient.","The transition included installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities retiring all the less efficient coal units and increasing levels of natural gas fired and renewable energy generation.","Since 2010, Alliant Energy has retired or repowered over 1,150 megawatts of coal-fired generation for about one third of our 2009 coal linked plate capacity. These retirements have been replaced with highly efficient gas-fired generation, which produces approximately half of the carbon emissions when compared to coal-fired generation.","Though natural gas prices in 2015 resulted in significant changes to the capacity factors of our gas units. Riverside had an approximately 50% capacity factor last year, more than doubled its prior five-year average. Our Emery combined cycle facility also experienced significant increase in operating hours during 2015.","With lower gas prices, the additional gas generation in our portfolio resulted in savings for our customers in 2015.","Now let me brief you on our construction activities. 2015 was again a very active construction year with over $1 billion deployed. Our investments included approximately $360 million for electric and gas distribution systems. This was one of the largest annual investments in those systems and will be an area of growing investment.","These projects are driven by customer expectations to make our electric system more reliable and resilient and to expand natural gas services, especially to communities that did not have access before.","In Iowa, the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is now approximately 75% complete. Forecasted capital expenditure for this project is approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017.","In Wisconsin, progress continues on the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unified. This project is approximately 90% complete and is on time and below budget. Capital expenditure forecast for this project are approximately $270 million and it is expected to be in service later this year.","Driven upgrades and pulverizing replacement work continues at Columbia and these performance improvements projects are expected to be complete next year. This spring construction of a Columbia unit to SCR will begin. WPLs capital expenditure for this project is approximately $50 million and it is expected to go in service in 2018.","In 2013, WPL announced that it will retire several older coal facilities and natural gas peaking units and therefore more than 50 years of dependable operation Nelson Dewey and Edgewater Unit 3 were retied in December. The retirement of these units puts several other retirements through 2019 but will result in a reduction of WPL capacities for approximately 700 megawatts. ","As a result, WPL proposed to construct the 700 megawatt highly efficient natural gas generating facility referred to as a Riverside Energy Center expansion. We anticipate the Public Service Commission will issue its decision on the Riverside expansion in the second quarter.","Earlier this month, we announced that we have negotiated options with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives for partial Riverside ownership of up to 55 megawatts during the construction facility and up to an additional 250 megawatts during the first five years of the facility is operating. ","With this agreement, the cooperatives have extended their wholesale electric contracts at WP&L by four years through 2026. We're pleased that our neighbor utilities realize the benefits of our proposed facility and want to be involved in this exciting and innovative project.","While we now expect the other from the Riverside units to be close to 700 megawatts, the capital expenditure for Riverside remains at approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission.","The targeted and service days has changed from early 2019 to early 2020. Therefore the timing of the capital expenditure have been updated and are reflected on Slide 3 based on input from the EPC bidders. The expenditures presented for Riverside do not reflect the possible capital reduction if the cooperatives exercise their 55 megawatt purchase option during construction.","In addition to the Riverside joint ownership option, hub service and MG&E will have the option to limit their capital expenditures at Columbia to paying for only the SCR during the time that Riverside is being constructed.","Our capital expenditure plan does not reflect this option being executed. However, we expect that any increase in our capital expenditures at Columbia would be largely offset if the electric co-ops exercise their purchase option 55 megawatts of Riverside.","Earlier this month the United States Supreme Court effectively delayed implementation of the clean power plant until legal challenges to the EPAs rules are resolved. This stay will not change our current resource or capital expenditure plan as they were not based on compliance with the clean power plant.","As we planned for our future generation needs, we aim to minimize emissions while providing safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. We believe that with the transition of our generation fleet and the availability of lower natural gas prices, our carbon emissions will continue to decrease.","We're very fortunate to operating states that have a long history of support for renewable energy and a strong commitment to environmental storage ship. We have and will continue to invest in purchase renewable energy. The currently owned 568 megawatts of wind generation and our 10-year capital plan includes additional wind investments to the customer energy needs.","In addition, we currently purchase approximately 470 megawatts of energy from renewable sources. Wind energy provided approximately 8% of our customer's energy needs in 2015.","Also your several solar projects under development from which we anticipate gathering valuable experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost effective manner into our electric system.","At our Madison headquarters with 1300 solar panels have been installed and they're now generating power for the building. Construction has also started on Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River landfill, which is adjacent to Riverside.","In an Iowa we'll be owning and operating the solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids and are reviewing responses to the RFP we issued for additional solar in our portfolio.","There is a sense of excitement as you work to transform the company to meet our customer's evolving expectations. A major improvement to our customer experience just happened as we went live with our new customer care and billing system.","The $110 million investment we placed the interim systems from the 1980s. Our new billing system will make communication with our customers more convenient and timely and will allow for us provide innovative service options. This project was another well executed major initiative. I do want to thank everyone that worked so hard for years to transform our customer experience.","At Alliant Energy we've already made great progress transitioning our utilities to a cleaner more modern energy system. This would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees who keep the customer at the center of everything we do.","Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid 2015 and we work hard to also deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. We anticipate no material change for the rate base growth through 2018 as the updated capital expenditure plan while offset any impact from the extension of bonus depreciation.","Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over the 2015 dividend target.","The central execution on our major construction projects include completing projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. Working with our regulators, consumer advocates; environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner.","Reshaping our organization to be leaner and faster while keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost effective customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We released 2015 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per share and our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $3.38 per share.","The non-GAAP to GAAP differences are due to a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the sale of IPOs Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and a $0.04 per share charge resulting from the approximately 2% of employees accepting voluntary separation packages as we continue focusing on managing cost for our customers.","Comparisons between 2015 and 2014 earnings per share are detailed on Slide 5, 6 and 7. Retail, electric, temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% or $0.04 per share at IPO and WP&L between 2015 and 2014. This excludes the impacts of the Minnesota sale.","The industrial segment continues to be the largest sales growth driver year-over-year. The 2015 results include an adjustment to our ATC earnings to reflect an anticipated decision from FERC expected to lower ATCs current authorized ROE of 12.2%.","We reserve $0.06 per share for 2015 reflecting an anticipated all in ROE of 10.82%. This is a result of the FERC Administrative Law Judge's initial decision issued in December 2015.","Now let\u2019s review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.90. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investment such as the Edgewater 5 and Lansing emission control equipment and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station.","The 2016 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail electric sales increases of approximately 1% for IPO and WP&L excluding the impacts of the Minnesota sale. Also the earnings guidance is based upon the impacts of IPOs and WP&Ls previously announced retail electric base rate settlements.","The IPO settlement reflected rate-based growth primarily from placing the Lansing scrubber in service in 2015. In 2016, IPO expects to credit customer builds by approximately $10 million. By comparison the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million.","During 2016 IPO also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million compared to $72 million in 2015. As in prior years the tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results.","The WPL settlement reflected electric rate base growth for the Edgewater 5 scrubber in baghouse projected to be placed in service in 2016. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.","Also included in WP&Ls rate settlement was an increase in transmission cost, primarily related to the anticipated allocation of SSR cost. As a result of a third quarter issued after the settlement, the amount of the transmission cost build to WP&L in 2016 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement.","Since the PSCW approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission costs, the difference between the actual transmission costs billed to WP&L and those reflected in the settlement has been accumulated in a regulatory liability.","We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance of approximately $35 million by the end of 2016. This regulatory liability is another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin retail electric customers.","Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPO, WP&L and AEC for 2016 and provides you the actual effective tax rates for 2015.","Turning to our financing plans, our current financing forecast incorporates the extension bonus depreciation deductions for certain capital expenditures for property through 2019. As a result of the five year extension to bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021.","This forecast is based upon the current federal net operating losses and the credit carry-forward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken under federal income tax returns over the next five years.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit ratings.","Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll be issuing approximately $25 million of new common equity through our share owner direct plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPO and approximately $400 million at the parent and Alliant Energy resources.","$310 million of the proceeds at apparent and Alliant Energy resources are expected to be used to refinance maturity of term loans. We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to reassessed.","As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the proposed riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures for 2017 and 2018 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity.","Before the five-year extension bonus depreciation, we were not expected to make any material federal income tax payments through 2017. Thus, the extension of bonus depreciation is not expected to change our financing needs for the next two years.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 9 during the second quarter of 2016 we anticipate a decision from the PSCW on the riverside expansion proposal and we anticipate filing a WP&L retail electric and gas rate case for 2017 and 2018 rates.","For IPL, we'll be filing our five-year emission plan and budget in the first quarter and expect a decision regarding the permanent application for the approximately $60 million Clinton Natural Gas pipeline in the second quarter. The next Iowa retail electric and gas based rate cases are expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2017.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the coming year.","At this time I'll turn the call back over the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Alliant Energy's Management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","Hi. Good morning. ","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Russo","Would you be able to possibly quantify the amount of equity you might need to help finance the riverside expansion?","Tom Hanson","Brian, as we said, our objective is to continue to maintain the targeted equity levels at both IPL and WP&L. So you can assume that with largest project here at WP&L that we will have incremental equity needs.","We'll be sharing specifics as we issue guidance in later years, but what\u2019s important are targeted incremental equity is included in our forward-looking guidance. So the delusion is reflected in our 5% to7% targeted growth rate.","Brian Russo","Okay. Great and it looks like '15 over '14 and '16 over '15 you got to kind of gravitating towards the lower end of the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR. Is there something structural there that as rate base grows its harder to get in the middle or the higher end or is it just a function of lumpiness of the CapEx?","Pat Kampling","Yes, what really is Brian is that our sales forecast has come down a little bit. Originally we were about 2% at Wisconsin 1% in Iowa. Now we see it as overall 1% and that's what's really brought us down to more to the midpoint of the range, not to the higher end of the range.","Brian Russo","Okay. And just to clarify, fourth quarter weather versus normal is negative $0.08?","Pat Kampling","That\u2019s correct.","Brian Russo","Okay. And what quarters did those two charges occur? Were they in the fourth quarter or earlier?","Tom Hanson","The third quarter we recorded the Minnesota charge and I believe second quarter was Minnesota's charge and then the third quarter was the charge associated with voluntary separation package. So second third quarter. Sorry Brian.","Brian Russo","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","First question on the CapEx update. Help me understand is the $260 million net increase over the years, is that pulling forward from the existing 10-year CapEx plan or would that be incremental to the $10.6 billion that you've forecast through 2020 for?","Pat Kampling","Yes so this is -- it's incremental to what we had shown you in the 10-year plan.","Andrew Weisel","Okay great. Next question I have is on a lot of the announcements you made on Riverside, I believe if I heard you correct, you said that the cash associated with incremental Columbia CapEx would be roughly offset by Muniz exercising the option for 55 megawatts, is that right and is there a scenario where you have one but not the other?","Pat Kampling","Andrew that is correct that they should offset each other as they both have been. We're not revising the CapEx until we know exactly what\u2019s going to happen with the gracious options at this point, but the additional capital for Columbia would be offset by the co-ops purchasing Riverside. But it is possible that one of the options could occur without the other. They\u2019re very independent of each other.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Could that be big enough to move the needle on equity needs?","Pat Kampling","I don\u2019t think so. We're talking capital of under $100 million here.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Great. Then lastly I might be reading the subtleties of the wording a little too closely, but in the press release, you added -- you have the expression striving to achieve the projected earnings growth rate.","And the last question you just talked about the lower sales growth. Any reason to think that the next years might be toward the low end of that range or do you still feel comfortable with the midpoint through the construction and maybe just commentary on how that -- how the outlook looks over the next several years.","Pat Kampling","Yeah, no, we're very confident and in keep in mind the reason we're gravitating towards the lower end right now is that when rate freezes and the sales forecast change from the timing you agree to rate freezes, but we're still very confident with our plan going forward especially as we enter rate cases about jurisdictions.","Andrew Weisel","Great, thank you very much. I appreciate the detail.","Pat Kampling","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, good morning.","Pat Kampling","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Couple questions just to follow up on the one with you mentioned on Riverside and Columbia and the co-ops how about also with Wisconsin energy and MGE just how do we think about both the impact of what they decide and when they likely decide on whether they're going to take more Riverside and share some of Colombia.","Pat Kampling","Yeah. So the Colombia is -- that change is happening during the Riverside construction that's between now and 2019. The purchase option is 2020 and beyond and that's really not in our CapEx plans.","That's something we're going to need to monitor. We'll be working with the other utilities as they develop their resource plans as well. But that's not something that we can actually estimate the probability of right now.","Steve Fleishman","So that would be after the plant fully done and operating basically.","Pat Kampling","Except for the 55 megawatts for co-ops, that's during construction.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And just the growth rate the 5 to 7 is that through 2018 or 2019 to follow the CapEx period?","Pat Kampling","Yes, it does. Yes, the CapEx period Steve, that's right.","Steve Fleishman","So it's 2019?","Pat Kampling","Yes.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then a question on the -- as I'm sure you're aware, we had a recent acquisition announcement of ITC and you have the transmission involvement there I'm just curious if you're likely to get involved and have any issues with that transaction or any intervention?","Pat Kampling","Steve, we wish we're analyzing the transaction as you can imagine. We're very large customer of ITC. So this is of quite interest to us as you can imagine. So we've had open dialogue with the folks at ITC and we just plan on having the open dialogue and we'll figure out exactly what our position is in their dockets, they have several dockets over the next several months.","Steve Fleishman","Is you intention just to file at FERC or do you think Iowa has a role at all?","Pat Kampling","We're still looking at what the different options are at this point Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from [Raza with L&T Capital].","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Just a quick question, on the rate base that you commented on earlier, is the deferred tax portion of rate base going up while the entire rate base total phase constant versus your prior guidance. Is that the best way to think about it?","Tom Hanson","I would characterize it that the NOLs along with the additional CapEx are offsetting the effect of the bonus depreciation.","Unidentified Analyst","The earnings base stays constant?","Tom Hanson","Yes.","Pat Kampling","Yeah, I would say the net rate base remains constant.","Unidentified Analyst","Net rate base, okay and then I think you commented on it a little bit earlier, but this incremental CapEx that you added, how does that affect financing plans over this period? Does it potentially lead to little more equity or not or how should we think about that?","Tom Hanson","The modest amounts that we're adding will not significantly change our equity needs. As Pat made reference, some of this is due to the timing of Riverside. Some of that cost is being pushed out and then we do have the opportunity to backfill as Pat mentioned with some of the electric gas distribution. So it's not going to be materially changing any of our financing needs.","Unidentified Analyst","And then the load growth you talked about, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but what is the forecasted load growth for your planning period?","Pat Kampling","Sure. We're using 1% now to book utilities. But I would say the growth is out of the 1%. It's higher in the industrial sector and lower in the residential sector.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pat Kampling","Sure. You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich","Jay Dobson","Hey good morning, Pat and good morning, Tom. Question just to follow-up on Raza's question. So the rate base with the change in bonus depreciation and CapEx is the expectation are flat. So the earnings growth will be flat.","But it doesn't really change your tax position. So cash flow we would anticipate would in fact be negatively impacted by the rise in CapEx, which facilitates the increase modest as you just said Tom, increase in financing needs. Do I have it right?","Tom Hanson","In the near term, yeah because when we had our previous forecast assuming no depreciation or potential bonus depreciation we were looking at making modest tax payments beginning in '17 and '18 and now with the extension, we won't have that, but that delta in terms of cash is not that significant certainly in the '17 and '18 timeframe.","Jay Dobson","Right. Okay, great. And then earned ROEs at the utilities subs what were those in '15 on sort of a non-weather adjusted basis understanding that weather is going to.","Pat Kampling","Yes we definitely earned our authorized return with [them] which was about 10.4 and then in Iowa is around the around 10% again excluding the Minnesota sale though.","Jay Dobson","Got it. And those are weather adjusted or -- so that would reflect that $0.08 adjustment or maybe more like a $3.57 number. I know it's not fair to say that on a jurisdictional basis but\u2026","Pat Kampling","Right I would say it's all in including the weather.","Jay Dobson","Got you. Okay fine. And then last one on trended, the transportation segment just what you see going forward there obviously a tough year in 2015 for that segment though it developed throughout the year. So not a great surprise but you look forward through '16 and beyond just volume trends you're seeing.","Pat Kampling","Trend it's actually going through our strategic planning process. Right now looking at other opportunities and where they can expand their current footprint. So I'm very optimistic about some possibilities that they're looking at right now, but they've been very proactive knowing the reduction in their business these are really basically cold transportation. They're looking forward at some other opportunities for them right now, some more to come on that.","Jay Dobson","Got it. But if we're thinking about '16 and it's probably within a broad range of guidance would you -- we certainly couldn't get back to the 2014 level of earnings from [Krandex but] probably do see some improvement with some of the strategic initiatives there we're reviewing currently, is that fair. ","Pat Kampling","I would say it might be beyond '16. It would be hard to execute on projects for '16, but definitely going into '17.","Jay Dobson","Got it, no that's fair. Thanks so much Tom thank you.","Pat Kampling","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. ","Paul Patterson","Good morning, guys. ","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just what was the 2015 weather adjusted sales year-over-year? What was the growth rate?","Tom Hanson","It was 1% in both of our two utilities. Again that's adjusting for the Minnesota sale.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then the sales forecast is now 1% what was it previously I apologize. ","Pat Kampling","Sure previously and this goes back to year ago, it was 2% Wisconsin and 1% in Iowa and now it's 1% in both jurisdictions.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then the incremental CapEx, I'm not exactly -- this is incremental above, this isn\u2019t bringing it forward from what I understand. This is new stuff. What is that and what's driving that?","Tom Hanson","We have provided a slide in our supplemental slides that kind of highlight that but I would put it basically in two big buckets. The first is dealing with our electric area in terms of certainly continuing to replace existing distribution lines. So it's really trying to upgrade the distribution system and we also have then some modest gas expansion as well.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And I guess so I'm wondering though is that if this is incremental over a 10-year forecast that would indicate that something is driving those. I saw the slide, I guess what I'm wondering is what's kind of driving this.","Is it something forward that would indicate that you guys see some new need and I am just wondering what that is or if there is one, what I am missing?","Pat Kampling","Yeah, I would just say that we're actually just taking the opportunity to expand some of these projects. We've had a replacement program for our overhead and underground system for years and we're just really increasing that taking the opportunity now to increase that and where we evaluate after this five-year program because actually for the next five years and if we want to accelerate even more in the second five-year time frame and again our customer's expectations are in liability and resilience you just keep increasing.","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Pat Kampling","This is our first stage of looking at that and putting good dollars to work for our customers.","Paul Patterson","And then just the Kewaunee power plant, I believe that the Wisconsin has halted implementation of that. Is there any impact that you guys see of that or how are you guys dealing with that served just on a high level. Any thoughts we should have on that?","Pat Kampling","Yes, at a high level, yes the safest [comment] is that they're not going to put any resources to work on any clean power plant implementation. However, the utilities are still working together to try to understand their own circumstances into the plan.","So we're working very proactively with the other utilities and we'll just have to see how this plays out in the State.","Paul Patterson","Okay. My other questions have been answered. Thanks so much.","Pat Kampling","Sure. You're welcome.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call -- we actually have a follow-up question from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","Yes, hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Just can you remind us what the base year and adjusted EPS is to formulate the 5% to 7% CAGR?","Tom Hanson","Brian, we update that every single year. You would want it, our non-GAAP temperature adjusted so similar to what we did in '14. So you would want to rebase that now that we reported our actuals for 2015. So the base for purposes that calculation would be $3.57.","Brian Russo","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

As you recall, we had originally forecasted additional renewal investments in the second five years of our 10-year capital plan. This plan accelerates this investment in order to take advantage of the full benefit of the production tax credit extension. This means that the expected in-service dates of the new wind project will now be in 2019 and 2020.","With this announcement, IPL filed an advanced rate-making principles application for RPU with the Iowa Utilities Board for fast approval to add owned and operated wind resources of up to 500 megawatts. A portion of the wind will likely be located near our existing Whispering Willow site in Franklin County, Iowa. We are also pursuing additional land options. We have requested a return on equity of 11.5%. Details of the filings maybe found on Slide 2.","As part of this filing, we have requested a temporary renewable energy rider. This rider would allow us to start recovering a return of and on the wind farm when they are placed in service, with us filing a traditional rate case. The rider also allows our customers to immediately receive the financial benefit of the reduction tax credits along with the energy benefit of the wind generation produced. If the rider is approved, it's expected to remain in effect until the IUB's final decision and a future retail electric base rate case.","We have requested that the IUB's make decision on this RPU application during the fourth quarter of this year, choose to make determined down payment to secure the full production tax credit extension level. The full production tax credits, and estimated energy benefits would more than offset, the return of and on the net investment and related O&M expenses resulting in a savings to customers over the life of the asset. The production tax credits will decrease by 20% if we are not able to initiate our investment until next year. ","We issued an RFP to several wooden suppliers in late June and expect those responses in a few weeks. After we evaluate the responses, you will then have a better estimate of the total cost and timing of the capital expenditures for the proposed project.","If this project is approved, we don't expect our 2016 to 2019 capital plan to change materially. We are finding that some of our planned capital projects are coming in below the original forecast and we expect to reprioritize and in some instance delay certain other capital expenditures that have not yet begun.","We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release. We do not anticipate that these changes to our capital expenditure plan will cause a change in our long-term earnings growth rate projections of 5% to 7%.","Renewable energy has been a meaningful part of our energy resources. We currently have 568 megawatts of owned wind generation and anticipate supplementing that with approximately 770 megawatts renewable purchase power agreements. The proposed Iowa investment with almost 12 owned and operated wind generation and placed Alliant Energy as one of the leading U.S. electric utilities with owned wind energy for our customers.","In addition to the RPU request of 500 megawatt of new wind investments, we anticipate filing a restructuring request with the IUB maybe this quarter to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. The transfer must be made as a lower of cost or market. Therefore our application -- if our application is approved by both the IUB and FERC, we would expect to take a non-recurring pre-tax charge of approximately half of Franklin County's net book value.","We are also evaluating additional wind energy purchases and future investments for Wisconsin customers. This will add economic and stable energy to our fuel cost and allow us to offset market purchases of energy.","Solar generation is also and expanding part of our renewable portfolio. We continue gathering value experience on how best to integrate solar in a cost-effective manner into our electric system. At our Madison headquarters, over 1,300 solar panels are now generating power for the building. Wisconsin's largest solar farm on our Rock River land field which is adjacent to Riverside is also now generating power. In Iowa construction is quickly progressing at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids. We will own and operate the solar panels.","A group of these as well as our recent announcement of the solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque are important to bringing renewable sources closer to our customers and working with them to create sustainable energy future.","Next week, we will issue our first corporate sustainability report which is an expansion of our past environmental report. The report does highlight that we had made significant reductions in NOx, Sox and mercury emissions. Report also highlights that carbon emissions continue to decrease due to additional renewable energy, increase use of efficient natural gas-fired generation and the transition of our cold-generation fleet. Therefore, we expect our carbon emissions to be reduced by 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels.","Now let me brief you on our 2016 construction activities with forecast investments of over $1.1 billion, it's almost half of that focused on our distribution system. Approximately $300 million is seen invested in our electric distribution system to make them more robust, reliable and resilient. This year's plan also includes approximately $200 million for improvements of expansion of our natural gas distribution business and several prior years trimming.","As you are aware, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the certificate of public convenience a necessity for the rural side expansion earlier this year. We expect the asset on the new Riverside units to be approximately 700 megawatt and the total anticipated capital expenditures remains at approximately $700 million excluding AAPC and transmission. Riverside is expected to be supplying energy to our customers by early 2020. AECOM has been selected to perform the engineering, procurement and construction, and the combustion turbines selected are GE 27s [ph] some of the most efficient units on production.","In Iowa the Marshalltown natural gas-fired generating facility is progressing well and is approximately 85% complete. Total capital expenditures for this project anticipated to be approximately $700 million excluding AFUDC and transmission. Marshalltown is on time and on budget and is expected to go in service in the spring of 2017.","Riverside and Emery are two primary existing gas generating facilities continue to experience increased dispatched when compared to prior years. During the first half of 2016, Riverside and Emery's capacity factors were approximately double their five year average. The ability to be on a gas-fired generation during period of low gas prices and also as a flexible resource during period of low wind or cloudy days demonstrate the importance of this resource and our balance energy mix.","Moving on to our existing cold fleet, we're nearing the end of our successful construction program to review submissions at our largest facilities. The Edgewater Unit 5 scrubber and baghouse project was completed on time and below budget. Constriction of the Columbia Unit 2 SCR is approximately 18% complete. WPL's total capital expenditure plan for this project is anticipated to be approximately $50 million, and it is expected to go in service in 2018.","There are several new regulations on the horizon ash plants, bottom ash and water usage at our cold-fired generating station. We have developed a plan and have begun to initiate that work needed to comply with these rules and regulations. Ash plant closers and bottom ash conversion projects are underway in Iowa, as that one is IPLs filed commission plan and budget.","In Wisconsin PSCW recently approved our application for bottom ash conversion at Edgewater 5. The total expenditures for our ash and water programs anticipated to be over $200 million for the next seven years. The rate base estimates provided in our Investor Relations presentation includes a near-term expenditure for this program.","During the past few years, we have been exciting on a plan for the orderly transition of our generating fleet to serve our customers in an economic manner. We made progress in building a generation portfolio that has lower emissions, greater fuel diversity and is more cost efficient. The transition includes increasing levels of natural gas-fired renewable energy generation, lower levels of coal generation through retirements and fuel switching, installing emission controls and performance upgrades at our largest coal-fired facilities. We have also started water and ash programs at our facilities to be occurring and expect future requirements. And I am proud of the fact, we've accomplished all of that while holding electric base rates flat for both IPL and WPL since 2011.","Let me summarize our key messages. We will work to deliver 2016's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2016 dividend increased by 7% over 2015 dividends. ","The central execution of our major construction projects, includes completing projects on time and at or below budget and in a safe manner. Working with our customers, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and communities in a collaborative manner.","Reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster, while keeping the focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, and we will continue to manage the Company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost effective customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian: Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2016 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, which was $0.03 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015","A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers may be found on Slide 3, 4 and 5. Consistent with the growth assumed in our 2016 earnings guidance, retail electric temperature normalized sales for Iowa and Wisconsin increased approximately 1% between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 excluding Minnesota.","The commercial and industry segment continue to be the largest sales growth drivers year-over-year. The second quarter 2016 result's included adjustments to our ATC earnings to reflect and anticipated decision related to the second complaint filed regarding the return on equity level charged by transmission owners and MISO.","We reserved $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2016 reflecting and anticipated all-in ROE of 10.2%, a reduction of 200 basis points from ATC's current authorized ROE of 12.2%. This reserve was triggered by the FERC Administrative Law Judges initial decision on the second complaint issued in June 2016. We are expecting a FERC decision by the end of this year for the first complaint, and within the first quarter of 2017 for the second complaint.","Now let's briefly review our 2016 guidance. In November, we issued our consolidated 2016 earnings guidance range of $1.80 to $1.95 per share on a full stock split basis. The key drivers for the 5% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investment such as the emission control equipment at Edgewater 5 and Lansing, and higher AFUDC related to the construction of the Marshalltown generating station.","The earing guidance is based upon the impacts of IPLs and WPLs previously announced retail electric base rate settlements. In 2016, IPL expects to cut its customer's bill by approximately $10 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2015 were $24 million. IPL also expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $62 million in 2016 compared to $72 million in 2015.","As in prior years, that tax benefit riders may have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year results. The WPL settlement for the 2016 test period reflected electric, rate-based growth for the Edgewater scrubber and baghouse which was placed in service this year. The increase in revenue requirements in 2016 for this and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency, cost recovery amortizations.","In addition, Slide 6 is provided to assist you in modeling 2016 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC.","Turning to our financing plans, our current forecast incorporates the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. As a result of the five year extension to bonus depreciation, Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021. With additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 with the proposed wind investment at IPL,","This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and the credit carry-forward positions, as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next five years.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our targeted liquidity and capitalization ratios as well as high quality credit ratings.","Our 2016 financing plan assumes we'll issue approximately $25 million of new common equity through our shareowner direct plan. The 2016 financing plan also anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL and up to $500 million at our non-regulated businesses.","$310 million of such proceeds are expected to be used to refinance the maturity of term loans at our Parent and non-regulated businesses.","As we look beyond 2016, our equity needs will be driven by the Riverside expansion project and a requested 500 megawatt wind investment at IPL.","Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures for 2017 would be financed primarily by a combination of debt and new common equity. Our 2017 financing plan currently assumes issuing up to $150 million of new common equity.","We may adjust our financing plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2016 and 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 7.","For IPL, our permit application for the Clinton Natural Gas pipeline has been approved. During the rest of this year, we'll be supporting the filings to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa and later this quarter, we plan to file a restructuring request to transfer the Franklin County wind farm from Alliant Energy Resources to IPL. We anticipate receiving decisions on both of these filing prior to our Iowa retail electric filing anticipated in April 2017. We expect to file the next Iowa retail gas based rate cases in the second quarter of 2017.","For WPL, we filed 2017 and 2018 retail electric and gas based rate case, which resulted from collaboration with the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and PSCW staff.","On Slide 8 we have provided a procedural schedule and the key financial elements of this retail electric and gas increase proposal. This filing includes new pricing options, as well as in increase in the fixed charge component of chairs [ph]. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW by the end of this year with new rates effective January 1, 2017.","Finally, I would like to update you on the information we plan to share during our next two quarterly earnings calls. Typically, during the third quarter, we have provided our following year's earnings guidance and dividend target, as well as updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast. Due to our planned filing of the IPL electric base rate case in 2017, we anticipate issuing 2017 earnings guidance during the year end call next February.","During our third call in November of this year, we expect to provide 2017 dividend target, update capital expenditure forecast and update rate base forecast. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company.","At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Mr. Durian. At this time the company will open up the call to questions for members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's Management will take as many questions as they can, within the one hour time frame for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel","Hey good morning everyone. I didn't know Tom take vacation. I actually thought he was in the office. ","Pat Kampling","We're not sure if this is a real vacation for him with all the little kids he's with right now, just to be honest.","Andrew Weisel","First question, a quick one, on Franklin I believe you said it's the lower of cost to market, so that would likely result in a charge in the next quarter. Are you able to give what the book value is, your expectation of the sell price, and is there any precedent of a transfer like that in Iowa going from an unregulated subsidiary to a regulated one within the same Parent company?","Pat Kampling","You asked a lot of questions there. Let me take them in order, and Robert chime in, when need be. We actually have on the investment deck on Slide 29 where we have the renewable energy win slide and we've put on that the book value of Franklin County and this was at year end, approximately $130 million Andrew. So, at the time of the transfer would be completed, want to probably check the impairment. So, we're looking into not receiving full approval into early next year, so that's something we'll be evaluating over the next several months.","You asked about precedent. You know, again, you are familiar that we've done this on the Wisconsin side of the house already, so we've been working with the parties in Iowa to make sure they understand exactly what we'll be asking for at that point. So, I don't expect to have any large issue with this, and again the rules of that transferred at the lower cost of market, so we'll be following those rules absolutely as well.","Andrew Weisel","Great. That's helpful. Next on the new wind project, your neighbors at [indiscernible] obviously also announced a pretty major investment in wind in the state. Have the two of you talked about working together, or do you know are regulators considering the proposal, similarly, competitively, independently, how should we think about those two projects going in tandem?","Pat Kampling","They are two separate dockets as you are well aware. MidAm is a little bit ahead of us, so I would consider them two separate dockets. As you are well aware though, we are partners with MidAm and several other joint coal units that we have a great relationship with them. But working with the state, as you can tell from our announcement, the state is very excited about both our investment and virtuous investment, so we're working with the state jointly to make sure that all these wind projects are delivered on time for our customers. So there is a very cooperative step between the two of us, but it is -- they are two different dockets.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Is there any concern about lack of enough resources whether it's equipment or labor or lands?","Pat Kampling ","No not at all. Again, before we made the filing, use issued the RFP to the vendors just to make sure that we still have supply out there. We haven't received the bids back yet, but the discussion with the vendor is going very, very well. As you are aware, we actually have the land around Franklin County already. So, we're actually talking to the towns people, and they are very excited for us to be putting more wind around their county. So, we don't anticipate with either utility having any issues with land in Iowa or resources getting these large projects completed.","Andrew Weisel","Very good. Then my last one. You mentioned that you are not expecting any chances of long-summer earning power. I'm a little surprised by that just because if this is going to be lowering your O&Ms and avoiding some purchase power, I would think that would create some headroom. I know customer bill affordability is your, if not top concern, one of your top concerns. Shouldn't that create some headroom for at least some incremental CapEx flow with your prior guidance?","Pat Kampling ","No. This is really too early to be upfront to answer that. We really need to step back and look at our multi-year plan Andrew and our rate case planning. But right now we're targeting our capital plan over the next few years. So we really target that 5% to 7%.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Great. Thank you for all the details.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann","Brian Russo","Good Morning. Can you just tell us what the Franklin County wind farm EPS contribution is in your 2016 guidance?","Pat Kampling ","I'll turn it over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Right now, we've expect about a $0.02 to $0.03 loss for 2016 which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past few years for Franklin County.","Brian Russo","Okay great. And I realize you guys are looking to maintain the five year capital budget, but could there potentially be changes in the annual spend, albeit coming up with same total five year budgeted amount?","Pat Kampling","The think we have to -- once we get the bids back from the winds vendors, we will expect a CapEx in the year of 2018 and 2019 to be increased from what we currently have. So that's what's we are really working through right now. Brian, it's too early to give you an indication of what those annual numbers are going to be, and we'll share that with you on our third quarter call mostly at EEI. But that's what we're going to -- right now to make sure we understand the capital and the financing plan that goes behind the capital plan.","Brian Russo","Then would you expect similar interveners in your Iowa wind filing similar to the interveners in MidAm's filing and those that were part of the settlement agreement?","Pat Kampling","That's a good question. We've been very transparent on this filing in Iowa as you can talk from all the attention we've gotten on it. We just filed last week. It's really too early to tell exactly what other parties are going to be part of it. We'll monitor that and like we've done in other cases, we'll make sure we are very transparent and collaborative with anybody that wants more information on the case.","Brian Russo","Let me ask you maybe a different way. You have large industrial customers that are supportive of kind of a greener overall footprint in their operations.","Pat Kampling","Absolutely. Most of our large customers want to book with us on their sustainability goals as well. So, we've done a lot of outreach trying before we estimate this filing with our large industrial customers. So, I would expect that the case would not have a lot of controversy. But it's too early to say, since we just filed it last week.","Brian Russo","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Senchak with Cannon.","Scott Senchak","Hi, thanks. Good morning. On Franklin, have you -- is there a potential opportunity down the line for repowering there, or is this just more just to bring in rate base and take it out from where it is now?","Pat Kampling","It's really just a transfer between the utilities. But I think all of us that have on the wind farms are looking down over that repowering opportunities, but that's way down the road, not initially. I mean this wind farm is only a couple of years old and is performing very well.","Scott Senchak","Got you. And then, do you guys have any other PPAs for wind currently where you would potentially look at repowering given the IRS guidelines and would you bring them in-house?","Pat Kampling ","I would tell you that, first we're focusing on our own new build and the ones that we currently own. We are supplementing as we've done historically. We're going to have another existing 770 megawatts of additional PPAs. We actually like the balance of owned wind and PPA wind. That should help stabilize cost for our customers. But we're not looking at any of that at this point, but there is definitely an opportunity down the road to look at that.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Bill Harvey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Kampling, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other members of the senior management team. Unfortunately, Tom Hanson, our CFO, will not be joining us today due to a back injury.","Following prepared remarks by Bill and Pat, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy\u2019s year-end 2011 earnings. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call, are available on the investor\u2019s page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy\u2019s press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","William Harvey","Thank you Sue, and good morning everyone. 2011 marked a successful year for us. We met our financial objectives and maintained excellent reliability during our hot and stormy summer season and we kept our safety initiatives moving forward. I would like to commend our employees who continue to provide our customers reliable electric and gas service while at the same time delivering value to our share owners. My comments today will detail our priorities for 2012. Later in the call, Pat will discuss various financial and regulatory matters.","As Sue mentioned, our CFO, Tom Hanson would normally present a major portion of our scripted remarks this morning, but Tom has suffered a back injury and is unable to join us this morning. Tom, if you are listening, get well soon.","Robert Durian, our Control and Chief Accounting Officer and John Kratchmer, our Treasurer are here to help us with your questions if need be.","In 2012, we will continue to focus on transforming our generating fleet. Our plans include retrofitting our Tier 1 coal facilities, fuel switching, we are investigating less expensive emission controls for our smaller coal plants and increasing the amount of gas fired generations in our portfolio. Our emission control equipment plants are intended to assure compliance with environmental rules. These expenditures are outlined on Slide 2.","Even though the Cross-State Rule was stayed, the current environmental work underway at IPL\u2019s Ottumwa and WPL\u2019s Edgewater and Columbia facilities support complying the with the Clean Air Interstate Rule which remains effective in the wake of the Cross State Rule stay, the Utility MACT Rule, or the Wisconsin State Mercury Rule. We planned to request regulatory approval for installing the remaining controls for our Tier 1 facilities, so they will be ready to comply with the Cross-State Air Rule or some new version of it. In Iowa, that regulatory discussion will occur through our Emissions Plan and Budget filing, which will be made on April 2. ","In Wisconsin, we expect to file the required construction authorization for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse later this year. The total capital investment of this broad emission control program is approximately $765 million occurring between 2012 and 2015. We are still in the process of assessing whether all the dynamics surrounding federal environmental regulation will change our Tier 2 capital expenditure projections for 2012 through 2015 which are currently estimated to be about $100 million. We have previously stated that we will not be fully retrofitting these units, so we are exploring lower-cost emission alternatives.","As I mentioned earlier, natural gas generation is becoming an increasingly important part of our balanced energy portfolio. WPL\u2019s application to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to purchase Riverside, a 600 megawatt combined cycle facility is proceeding well. This purchase would increase WPL\u2019s gas-fired generating capacity by about 100 megawatts. The Commission has indicated that it intends to review this application without a hearing and we anticipate a decision in April. Our expectation is that closing will occur at the end of 2012. We expect the revenue requirements associated with adding Riverside to rate base will be offset by the elimination of the capacity payments currently being made to Calpine, therefore making the purchase essentially neutral to customers.","At IPL, we continue the due diligence and planning related to the potential construction of the new 600 megawatt natural gas combined cycle generating facility. Last week, we issued an RFP to assess if there are any better alternatives to construction of the gas plant. If the new natural gas facility is the preferred option, we anticipate making the required regulatory filings in the third quarter of this year. At this time, we are estimating that the proposed facility would cost approximately $700 million, excluding AFUDC. Our capital expenditure plan anticipates expenditures related to that facility to begin in 2014 with an anticipated in-service date in 2016.","I also want to provide you an update on our nuclear purchase power agreements. At this point it is unlikely that we will renew either of our current agreements. WPL\u2019s Kewaunee agreement with Dominion Resources expires at the end of 2013. An IPL\u2019s Duane Arnold agreement with NextEra Energy expires in February of 2014. Slide 3 reflects the various capacity payments expected to be made over the next several years. The considerable decrease in capacity payments in 2014 plays an important role in how we plan to manage customer rates.","While we continue to rely on lower emission coal for the majority of our base load generation, we expect the emissions from our coal plants will continue to decline as our retrofits become operational and as we transition some of our older less efficient units to run on natural gas. In addition, our wind farms operate in very strong wind regimes and our customers in Iowa are benefiting from the transmission upgrades which support our expanding wind production.","One of the key objectives of our plan is to manage the cost borne by our customers. This year, our customers are seeing lower total electric and gas bills as we pass through the benefit of lower energy cost to them. These lower overall cost result from a combination of the lower market cost, our generating fleet transition, and our increased wind generation.","Moving to the unregulated side of the business. The Franklin County Wind Farm in Iowa is preparing to begin construction. This site located near IPL\u2019s Whispering Willow site is known for its high wind regime. Also the transmission upgrades involving this site are already in progress. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $235 million, excluding capitalized interest cost. We expect this project will be in service by year end and we will likely elect the cash grant. We are currently assessing the results of the reverse RFP we issued to look and off take contract for the facility.","Before handing off to Pat, let me address RMT. In our last call, I indicated that we would assess the alternatives for this business. Yesterday, the Alliant Energy Board of Directors approved the plan to sell the RMT business. We have always maintained that while RMT does not fit our core strategy as a utility, it was attractive to us because of its important position in the renewable energy space. However; a lack of consistent federal renewable energy policy coupled with downward pressure on project margins has caused us to reconsider this investment. RMT\u2019s employees and clients will be best served by an owner whose operations are more (inaudible) with RMT\u2019s engineering and construction business.","As a result of this decision we plan to start recording RMT financials as discontinued operations in 2012. We expect the sale to occur by year end. Since RMT\u2019s revenues have a significant impact on how state taxable income is apportioned among the states, selling RMT will change Alliant\u2019s future state tax apportionment. Although, this change will have a minimal financial impact on future utility earnings, it is expected to lead to a onetime charge of approximately $0.12 per share at the utilities. We will exclude this potential onetime charge from our 2012 guidance."," ","So, let me recap the priorities as we execute our plan. First, we continue to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service to our customers. Second, we are working to obtain a generation portfolio that is balanced with flexibility to comply with current and future environmental regulations. Third, we continue to focus on managing costs on behalf of our customers. And finally, we will work closely with our regulators and stake holders to receive the remaining approvals required for the execution of our strategic plan.","In closing, I would like to recognize and congratulate Pat Kampling on her election as Chair President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliant Energy effective April 1 of this year. Many of you have got to know Pat during her career. Her experience in and knowledge of the industry will enable her to continue to execute on Alliant Energy strategy which will be of great benefit to our employees, our customers and our share owners.","On a personal note, it has been a pleasure getting to know many of you over these many years. I wish you all well and thank you for your support of our company. I will now turn it over to Pat."," ","Patricia Kampling ","Thank you Will for the kind remarks. I would also like to thank you for your tremendous contribution and dedicated service to the employees, customers and share owners of Alliant Energy. We are all going to miss you and wish you all the very best in retirement. ","Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with 2011 results. We released earnings this morning with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $2.73 per share. Adjusting for items we typically exclude from guidance, 2011 adjusted earnings were $2.76 per share. The 2011 adjustments relate to charges for the IPL electric rate case decisions, the cash balance pension plan amendment, emission allowance contract and impairments. These charges were substantially offset by non-recurring state income tax impacts. Comparisons between 2011 and 2010 earnings per share are detailed on Slides 4, 5 and 6."," ","Moving to the economy in our service territory, 2011 weather normalized, electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers, increased modestly. However, like the other utilities in our region, residential electric sales decreased by approximately 1% when comparing 2011 to 2010."," ","As we noted in November, we all forecast in 2012 sales in all customer classes to be flat to 2011. These trends are illustrated on Slide 7. Our current liquidity position is strong, totaling approximately $960 million comprise of $925 million of available capacity under our credit facility and $35 million of available capacity under the sale of receivables program."," ","We recently increased the price of our credit facility to $1 billion to help ensure adequate liquidity to finance our capital plans. Two of the primary factors influencing the financing plans are the cash flow impact from our current tax initiatives and our capital expenditure plan which is summarized on Slide 8."," ","We will finance our 2012 capital plan with cash flows for operations, sale of IPL receivables and the issuance of short term and long term debt. Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong for the next few years as we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments through 2014. These cash flow benefits will be partially offset with approximately $80 million in credits to customer bills in accordance with the IPL tax benefit writer."," ","Our current plan anticipates issuing long term debts of approximately $100 million for IPL, which should occur in the first half of 2012 and approximately $400 million in total for WPL and the Franklin County wind farm project which are expected to occur in the second half of 2012."," ","In addition we have requested regulatory approval for a $300 million, one year bridge facility to finance the river side purchase, which if utilized will lower the need for long term debt financing at WPL."," ","In December we did make a $100 million contribution to the qualified pension plans to mitigate increases in 2012 pension cost and increase the funding levels to approximately 85%. We do not currently anticipate making any contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2012."," ","One last note regarding financing plans. A recent development that could influence our plans is the ability to now consider receiving the cash grant instead of Production Tax Credits for the Whispering Willow and Bent Tree wind farms. Recent legislation has waived the tax normalization requirements. Thus the cash grant may now be more beneficial to our utility customers than the PTCs. The election to claim the cash grant in lieu of PTCs could provide our company with additional cash in excess of $250 million as soon as this year. We plan on discussing the possible cash grant election with our regulators in the coming months to determine such regulatory treatment.","Our current financing plans call for a need to issue modest new common equity in late 2013. The ability to repeat the cash grant on both wind farms would definitely push the need for equity past that point.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of notes for 2012, which are summarized on Slide 9. I would like to provide a bit more detail on two potential base rate cases.","We are currently evaluating the need to file a Wisconsin retail electric and gas base case in 2012 with a 2013 and 2014 test year. Our preliminary analysis would support a retail electric rate increase of 3% or less. The primary drivers of the case would be the recovery of the emission control projects at Edgewater 5 and Columbia. I Bill noted earlier, the anticipated Riverside gas facility acquisition is expected to have minimal customer rate impact. Also, since the fuel monitoring level is set as part of the base rate cases in Wisconsin, any increase we may request may be offset by changes in fuel costs.","We are also evaluating the need to file an IPL Iowa retail gas case for 2012, for the 2011 test year. It has been 7 years since base rates have changed for Iowa retail gas customers and during that time, plant additions have outpaced depreciation expense. ","We have also experienced a 12% decline in weather normalized residential use for customer since 2004. We will be proposing the use of a tax benefit rider to offset the requested gas rate increase.","Finally, I would like to inform you on a few items that should assist in modeling our future earnings.","We have revised our 2012 midpoint of guidance to reflect moving RMT to discontinued operations. Our revised 2012 earnings guidance midpoint is $2.90 per share, a $0.14 increase over the non-GAAP 2011 earnings.","Our 2012 utility guidance remains unchanged and reflects stable economies, normal weather conditions, and flat weather-normalized electric sales. The capital expenditure guidance for 2012 to 2015 provided in November remains unchanged. In addition, a summary of the guidance (inaudible) for 2011 to 2012 is available on Slide 10.","Our target dividend payout ratio is 60 to 70% of utility earnings. The board approved an approximate 6% increase in the targeted dividend payout for 2012. Our annual dividend target is $1.80 per share, which results in a yield of over 4% to our shareowners based on our current stock price.","On Slide 11, we have highlighted the 2011 quarter-over-quarter impact of the tax benefit rider. You will note that the quarter-over-quarter profile of 2012 is different than 2011. This difference is mainly due to the fact that the tax benefit rider did not go into effect until February 2011 and the 2011 results were impacted by warmer than normal summer weather, whereas 2012 guidance assumes normal weather. As a reminder, the tax benefit rider causes earnings swings from quarter-to-quarter, but does not impact earnings on an annual basis. Also on Slide 12, we have provided the drivers for the changes in the effective tax rates from 2011 to 2012.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you this year.","At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Miss. Kampling. At this time, the company will open up the call to questions from members from the investment community. Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour time frame for this morning\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi, good morning.","Patricia Kampling","Good Morning Brian.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Just the decision to move RMT to discontinued operations, does that mean you have kind of tested the market and feel that you could actually sell that year-end? I mean, if there have been any discussions with other parties of their interest in that subsidiary?","","William Harvey ","Brian, we have done sufficient exploration to believe that we can sell the business by year-end next year, but to date there have been no serious discussions with any third party about the potential acquisition. We expect that that process will begin in earnest very shortly.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","And how would you suggest we value that business? Should we look at it from a revenue perspective or multiple to operating income or and maybe even you could talk about the backlog?","William Harvey ","Sure, we are advised by people that know much more about these things than we that these businesses tend to get valued as a multiple of their EBITDA\u2019s, depending upon where the market sits at any point in time, somewhere between two and six times EBITDA is what we are advised.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay and just any comments on the backlog?","","William Harvey ","We have got about $235 million of project revenues booked for this fiscal year.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay great. Can you talk about \u2013 I know it is early in the year, but just the cost controls you are planning on implementing at each of the utility subsidiaries?","","Patricia Kampling","Sure, Brain. These cost controls have been work-in-process now for a couple of years and a lot of the work that is going on now is with our generation fleet. We have converted some of our older coal facilities to gas, the second one would be converted in the second quarter of this year. There is so much tremendous bottom line savings to the organization. And I again, we are just an organization of spending the right amount of money at the right time, very (inaudible) and very disciplined and that we are seeing the costing savings in the bottom line just seen in our results.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. Thank you very much and Bill good luck on your future endeavors.","","William Harvey","Thanks Brian, same to you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jay Dobson, Wunderlich Securities.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Good morning Bill, congratulations on your retirement.","","William Harvey","Thank you, Jay.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","And I hope there isn\u2019t any indication in Tom\u2019s back injury of who really did the heavy lifting this quarter.","","William Harvey","Jay, you have known me long enough to know that it sure isn\u2019t me.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","More seriously, wanted to return to the RMT, how do you envision this process, is this going to be an auction style process, just how you envision it sort of playing out as you pursue viable buyers over the next several quarters?","","William Harvey","Honest answer at this point in time Jay, is I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something that we will figure out in consultation with the advisors that we retain to help us with the transaction.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Okay, fair enough. And how did that $235 million of backlog compare with where you were last year, has that grown or is that sort of stagnant, how would that compare?","","William Harvey","I would say it is relatively comparable to the book to business that we had in place at this time last year, plus or minus a little bit.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Okay, fair enough. And then turning to the Colonie negotiations, it seems like that is a bit of change from last quarter, where you sort thought, Duane Arnold renegotiated that Colonie would be and now neither will be, is that a factor of natural gas prices or is it something else changing there that you could help us understand?","","William Harvey","I think what you should hear in that remark is that while our efforts at that point in time were continuing with the Dominion Resource is that we are out, the Duane suspect that Dominion would share this perspective that we are of that view that we are not going to get to a satisfactory deal and consequently we think those conversations are ended.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. So really they are at the stages as Duane Arnold, you don\u2019t anticipate any other, it is not again a negotiating ploy or anything like that?","","William Harvey","No, we are not doing a rope a dope here. We think both parties made a very very earnest, intense, good faith effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement and we just failed to do that, there is no hard feelings either way, but I think we are finished.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. And then last question, I know some of this is in process, but maybe you can sort of talk us through at least how you are thinking about it, and since Pat will take the baton, April 1, sort of how she is thinking about it. And I am referring to the capacity chart roll off for Duane Arnold and Colonie as you roll out into \u201914 and then obviously have environmental spends coming on it variable times and obviously then the gas plant that should be adding in the 2016 timeframe. How should we think about balancing that since earnings needs will vary over that timeframe?","","Patricia Kampling","Yeah sure, really the story hasn\u2019t changed, the timing of this just works out that we will have the large capital additions going into service at the time the capacity payments roll off. But as part of our rate case strategy we are hoping to have cases going forward with minimal customer impact even with this large capital expenditure plan, so that has not changed.","","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. Okay I will follow up more offline, thanks so much.","","Patricia Kampling","Okay.","","Operator","Next is Ashar Khan, Visium Asset Management.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","Hi, could you just mention, you mentioned you might this $250 million of cash, if I heard it correct. To me it\u2019s a big amount, could you just tell us, I guess the utilization of it? How should we look at it? And when we know specifically whether we have this or not?","","Patricia Kampling","Sure, but we\u2019ll probably know, we are hoping in the second quarter once we have our conversations with our regulators on how the cash grounds would be utilized in the rate making process. I mean, really is it\u2019s cash, it\u2019s the grab money from both the Whispering Willow and the Bent Tree Wind Farm, you know combine the capital on those are almost $900 million, so the cash grant money is substantial. In the short run, we will be using it displace some long-term financing that we might need, but over the multiple years, it is really going to be pushing out the need for common equity.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","Pat, can I ask you how much of \u2013 I guess it is a big amount, if you utilize it, how many years of common equity does it fore stall, can you help us? Based on the budgets you have given us for the next three years.","","Patricia Kampling","We see it pushing out equity at least a year.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","So, by like what? End of 2014 or 2015?","","Patricia Kampling","Yeah about that.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","Okay thanks. And then can you just reiterate, I guess with RMT the growth rate still remains \u2013 your anticipated growth rate long-term?","","William Harvey","I am sorry, could repeat that?","","Patricia Kampling","It\u2019s with the absence of RMT, would you see growth remaining same? Yes it would be.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","And can you remind us what that is?","","Patricia Kampling","We are still saying 5% to 7% a year.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","5% to 7% per year and what would be the base here?","","Patricia Kampling","2010 weather normalized.","","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management","2010 weather normalized, okay, thank you.","","Operator","Next is James Krapfel, Morningstar.","","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Hi, good morning.","","William Harvey","Good morning Jim.","","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","You had mentioned on the call that you could get somewhere in the range of 2 to 6 times EBITDA for RMT, at least that\u2019s what your hearing. What was EBITDA for the business, say for the last three years?","","William Harvey","It was around $6 million, $7 million.","","Patricia Kampling","Yes.","","William Harvey","Yeah, I think 6 to 8.","","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","6 to 8.

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank you on the call and the web cast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release yesterday, announcing Alliant Energy\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings and reaffirming 2014 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call, are available on the Investor Page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy\u2019s press release issued yesterday and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another solid quarter. Consolidated earnings were $0.56 per share, bringing our year-to-date earnings in at $1.53 per share, which is $0.28 higher than year-to-date earnings last year. Included in our year-to-date earnings is a positive weather benefit of $0.14 per share. However, we expect that the mild July weather will negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.09 per share. Therefore, our year-end earnings are now trending back towards the midpoint of our earnings guidance issued in November 2013, which was based on normal weather.","The economy continues to improve in our service territories. Unemployment rates in both Iowa and Wisconsin are below the national average and we continue to see higher electric usage from our industrial customers, with increases of 2.5% in the second quarter, and 3.6% year-to-date, compared to the same periods last year. It is great to see our communities experiencing economic expansion across many industrial sectors throughout our service territory. Tom will provide more detail on these sales trends later.","2014 is a critical year as we transform our generation fleet and I'm happy to report that all the projects are progressing very well. We recently celebrated the completion of Columbia's baghouses and scrubbers. The project was placed in-service on time, and we estimate that the total cost will be approximately 5% below the $630 million original budget. The installation of the baghouse and scrubber at Ottumwa is on-time and on budget and expected to be placed in-service in December. In addition, MidAmerican has completed construction of baghouses and scrubbers at Neal Units 3 and 4. Also, the construction of Lansing's scrubber will begin this month, and the construction of Edgewater unit 5 baghouse and scrubber recently started.","In addition to our progress in transforming our Tier 1 units, we are also making progress of preparing our Tier 2 units to be compliant with the Utility Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by the April 2015 deadline. The work we are performing on these units will position them to operate for the near future as we continue the orderly transition of our generation fleet. We are currently installing low-cost emission controls at our Prairie Creek and Burlington generating stations so they continue to burn coal, and we are converting our M.L. Kapp Generating Station from coal to natural gas. Through year-end 2013, we have spent approximately $20 million on these facilities and our 2014 to 2017 capital expenditure plan includes additional investments of approximately $30 million.","We recently had our groundbreaking ceremony in Marshalltown, Iowa to officially celebrate the beginning of the construction of our Marshalltown Generating Station. The outpouring of support from the community has been tremendous. We selected KBR as our engineering, procurement and construction contractor and Siemens turbines for the major equipment for the 650-megawatt combined cycle natural gas facility. This contract locks in approximately 80% of the plant and natural gas pipeline construction expenditures.","As a reminder, the IUB approved a return on common equity of 11% for the 35-year depreciable life of the Marshalltown facility, and the use of 10.3% return on common equity for the calculation of AFUDC. The order also established a $920 million cost cap, including AFUDC and the transmission upgrade costs. We believe that the cost cap is sufficient to complete the project, including the transmission upgrade costs. We anticipate ITC will self-fund the transmission upgrade and build IPL for the associated revenue requirement. We expect these costs to flow through the transmission rider.","We are truly seeing a transformation of our fleet to one that has lower emissions, while staying on the focused reliable and affordable power generation for our customers. The next generation resource we are planning is a capacity and energy addition at WPL for 2019. WPL is conducting a feasibility study of resource options, and we have recently received responses to the request for proposal we issued to determine what available options exist. The RFP was up to 600 megawatts to recognize the need of approximately 300 megawatts relating to the retirement of 3 coal units, as well as the need for capacity to replace the anticipated retirement of several older gas peaking units. Our current capital expenditure plan includes a new 300 megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle generating side facility as a placeholder until we determine the desired resource. We anticipate making the regulatory filing with the PSCW in early 2015.","Now let me update on you our recent regulatory activities. We have received a written order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WP&L to freeze retail electric base rates, which were set in 2011 at their current levels through the end of 2016. Also, retail natural gas customers' base rates will be reduced by $5 million in 2015, followed by a freeze of those rates through 2016.","The order includes the return of and on the significant investments made in our emission controls projects at Columbia and Edgewater, as well as our investments in the electric and natural gas distribution systems. The recovery of these investments is offset by changes in the amortization of the energy efficiency regulatory liability. This regulatory reliability comes from over-collections we received from customers during the past few years. We expect to have $64 million in this regulatory liability at the end of 2014 and we expect to use $17 million in 2015 and $32 million in 2016. The order provides for the continuation of the 10.4% ROE, a common equity ratio of slightly above 50%, and the ROE sharing mechanism starting at 10.65% that was established in the last base rate settlement. The fuel monitoring level will continue to set be set annually. We submitted the fuel-only filing for 2015 and it is currently under review by the PSCW. We expect to receive an order by year end.","In March, we announced a unanimous retail electric base rate settlement between IPL, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Iowa Consumer Coalition, and the Large Energy Group to freeze retail electric base rates for Iowa customers through 2016. This settlement includes a customer billing credit of $70 million for 2014, $25 million for 2015, and a final credit of $10 million for 2016. We had agreement from all the parties and the IUB to begin crediting customer bills in May. The credits are subject to a true-up based on the IUB's final decision. Today, we have responded to 2 data requests from the IUB and will be responding to a third set of data requests very shortly. We anticipate a decision from the IUB on this proposed settlement this quarter. Approval of the settlement will extend the retail electric base rates set in 2011 through 2016.","This multi-party settlement allows for the continuation of the energy adjustment clause, the transmission rider and the electric tax benefit rider credits through 2016. The settlement terms are based on maintaining the current authorized return on equity, common equity ratio, and earning a return of and on the 2014 year-end Iowa electric retail base rates of approximately -- rate base of approximately $3.1 billion. The rate base additions include the investments at Ottumwa, Neal, Burlington and, Prairie Creek, as well as investments in our electric distribution system. Pending the IUB's approval of this settlement, we anticipate that the next retail electric base rate case will be filed on the first half of 2017 to coincide with the in-service of the Marshalltown Generating Station.","On the federal level, the recent FERC decision on ISO New England's authorized return on equity may impact ATC's ROE. The range of ROEs and FERC's decision was from 10.57% to 11.74%. If those same bookends were applied to ATC's current 12.2% allowed ROE, we would expect Alliant Energy's annual earnings exposure would be negative $0.03 and $0.01 per share, respectively.","And finally, I would like to take a brief moment to discuss EPA's proposed carbon policy. EPA's Clean Power Plan would require states to develop plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 2030. The proposed reduction for Wisconsin is 34% and for Iowa, 16% from 2012 levels. We will advocate for our customers in 3 main areas: First, that the EPA's plan allows us to continue to provide safe and reliable power to our customers; second, that the EPA recognize the investments we have already made and thus, receive full credit for those investments toward future compliance goals; and third, for attainable goals on a reasonable timeframe.","So let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a successful first half of 2014 and we believe we are on track to deliver another solid year of earnings. We will continue to manage the company, striking a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. We have a plan to continue to meet our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective, and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We are making progress transforming our generation portfolio to one that is balanced, with lower emissions and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations. At the same time, we are focused on economically meeting the energy and capacity needs of our customers.","We continue to work closely with our regulators and stakeholders to obtain fair and timely outcomes. And finally, I must acknowledge and give thanks to our dedicated workforce which not only provides outstanding service to our customers, but also delivers the financial results that we are talking about today.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We announced second quarter 2014 earnings last evening with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.56 per share. These earnings are a $0.03 share decrease when compared to 2013 second quarter earnings of $0.59 per share. Comparisons between 2014 and 2013 second quarter earnings per share are detailed on Slides 2 and 3.","Second quarter 2014 earnings were lower than second quarter 2013, primarily due to retail electric consumer billing credits at IPL, higher energy efficiency cost amortizations at WPL, higher generation, O&M and interest expenses at IPL and higher depreciation expense at both IPL and WPL, resulting from placing environmental projects in service. These negative drivers were partially offset by lower capacity payments related to the renegotiation of the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchased power contract and the expiration of the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant PPA. The reduction of the capacity payments allows us to earn a return on and of rate base increases at both utilities while keeping retail consumer base rate stable.","Our current forecast for weather normalized sales, and a comparison to 2013 weather normalized sales is illustrated Slide 4. Based on our sales-to-date and our forecasted sales for the rest of the year, we have increased our projected industrial and commercial sales at WPL and have left the projected IPL increase unchanged when compared to our 2014 sales forecast for first quarter call. Several industrial customers have expanded their operations or have increased their production to meet demand. Industrial segments experiencing electric sales growth due to plant or production expansions include chemicals, health services and manufacturing. For our residential sales at both IPL and WPL, we are now forecasting weather normalized sales growth of approximately 1% to 1.5% when compared to last year.","IPL's tax benefit riders resulted in a $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter variation in the second quarter of 2014 when compared to the second quarter of 2013. The actual and projected quarterly earnings impact of the 2014 tax benefit riders are provided on Slide 5. The tax benefit riders are not expected to impact full-year 2014 results. The walk from the 2013 to the 2014 projected effective tax rates is provided on Slide 6. Please note that the 2014 effective tax rates include electric and gas bill credits of $97 million through IPL's tax benefit riders.","We expect cash flows from operations to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We also benefit given we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2016, nor do we expect to make any contributions to our qualified pension plans through at least 2016 since they were approximately 95% funded at the end of 2013. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics.","Our financing plan assumes the sale of our Minnesota distribution assets closes in 2014. The estimated gross sale proceeds of $130 million is expected to be used to reduce IPL's financing needs. The sale requires state and federal regulatory approvals. We filed for both the electric and gas sales with the MPUC earlier this year and are in dialog with the various stakeholders. These transactions also require IUB and FERC approvals. We plan to submit our filing to request IUB approval of the electric sale later this quarter.","Our current financing plans anticipate issuing approximately $250 million of long-term debt at each utility in the latter half of 2014. We also plan to refinance the $250 million, 4% debt at the parent and the $60 million debt at the Franklin County Wind Farm later this year. We currently anticipate issuing approximately $150 million in aggregate of new common equity in 2015 and '16. We do not plan to issue any material new common equity this year. We may adjust our plans as deemed appropriate if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets for 2014, which are summarized on Slide 7. We filed IPL's Emission Plan and Budget in April. As you may recall, the Emission Plan and Budget is the regulatory evaluation process for major environmental projects in Iowa. The plan we filed is consistent with our current capital plan.","In Minnesota, we filed the biennial 15-year Integrated Resource Plan for IPL. Included in the plan is the anticipated 10-year wholesale contract IPL will have with the Minnesota -- Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative as a result of the proposed energy distribution sale in Minnesota. Further, it reveals a need for additional energy later this decade. We will continue to evaluate our options to meet our customers' future energy needs.","In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority to install an SCR at Columbia Energy Center's unit 2. WPL's portion of the capital expenditures for this project is estimated to be approximately $70 million. Also, we plan to file for the approval of the proposed generation investment at WPL early next year.","On the third quarter call we plan on providing 2015 earnings guidance and updating our capital expenditure guidance and forecasted rate base. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting you throughout this year.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Andrew Weisel, Macquarie.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","My first question is on the usage trend, you sound incrementally more positive. Can you talk about the weather adjusted load growth in the quarter? Typically, you include that in the EPS bridge, but I didn't see anything about either weather or the weather-normalized trends.","Thomas L. Hanson","If you take a look at our earnings release, on the last page, we show some of the operating statistics for the quarter. Really, weather was basically comparable to the second quarter of 2013. So quarter-over-quarter, there's really no difference. The benefit that Pat referred to, really, was predominantly in the first quarter. And in terms of the sales forecast, as I did say, we are seeing some improvement in our industrial and commercial, and for all intents and purposes, residential is kind of still hovering at that 1% to 1.5% level.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Next question is on O&Ms. Last call, we talked about potentially accelerating some of that given how strong the winter was and that you had some flexibility both for the planned expenses in '14 and '15. How should we think about that now given that it sounds like July was not particularly good for you guys? Should we think of O&Ms going back toward what the original budget was before the year started, or have you already pulled forward some of the spending that would help 2015 earnings?","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure, Andrew. We did pull some of the O&Ms forward. However, we still have flexibility as the year unfolds. We still have August and September to get through, which are -- again, we're a third quarter company. But we still have flexibility to move the O&M around as warranted.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. So again, should I think about the full-year budget as of now looking similar to how it was when we entered the year and similar for next year's budget?","Thomas L. Hanson","Assume that the incremental O&M is in that probably about $7 million range of additional spending that was not originally intended in our forecast when we issued this last year.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great, that's very helpful. And then lastly, there's the comment about the WPL earnings deferral. What was the earned ROE at WPL you needed to take the deferral? And can you just remind how the process works, is that a one-time charge or could that reverse if the ROE falls in future quarters?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes. It certainly is metrical. So as, certainly, sales and weather would move up and down, certainly, that would go commensurate with that. But we were above the 10.65% for the second quarter, and that's why we needed to then take the reserve for the fact that we're now in the first year where there's a sharing mechanism with customers at 50% for each of the 2 parties.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Russo, Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Sorry if I missed this earlier, but I got on the call just before the Q&A started. I'm just curious, the $0.11 negative driver for the retail electric customer billing credits at IPL, is that just a first -- second quarter or is that something we're going to see throughout the year?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, Brian, that has to do with the $70 million credit going back to customers this year, and IPL is part of the settlement. So you'll be seeing that each quarter this year.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So roughly $0.11 each quarter or just relative to the seasonality of sales?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, seasonality because it's based on kilowatt hours.","Thomas L. Hanson","We did start this in May, Brian, and assume it's $70 million, then, for calendar year '14.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, I assume you reaffirmed your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes we did.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just can you remind me what the normalized sales growth assumption is?","Thomas L. Hanson","We did talk about that, Brian. In terms of the commercial and industrial, we're continue to see an improvement in the economy. So we're looking at about a 2% increase at IPL in terms of industrial and commercial and at WPL, a little bit higher at 4%. And if you look at Slide 4, we typically share the comparison to last year, so hopefully, that's a slide that you're familiar with, Brian.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And what about the residential?","Thomas L. Hanson","Residential, we're seeing about a 1% to 1.5% increase.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Levi, Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Sorry if we kind of go over some stuff that maybe was said. We've got a lot of different calls going on today. So anyway, just weather wise, I don't know if you covered this already. I know you talked about, there was $0.09 anticipated, at least for the third quarter that -- versus normal right, that's what you said?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. The impacts for the mild weather in July were estimating to be approximately a $0.09 drag. And that's just for July.","Andrew Levi","Just for July, okay. And...","Patricia L. Kampling","The first half of the year, we had a positive $0.14.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So right now, we're at probably about positive $0.05 versus normal, absent August.","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes.","Andrew Levi","Got it. And then, just on the comment on the $150 million of equity, which has obviously been in your forecast, how would you characterize that now? Because I know, I don't know, maybe there was some thinking that maybe you weren't going to need all of it, and obviously, you're still not on that phase of exactly whether you do or don't, I would still guess, or you're definitely going to do the $150 million?","Thomas L. Hanson","Our plan does assume that we're moving forward with the $150 million, Andy.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So that's definite, there's no kind of flexibility there?","Thomas L. Hanson","Well, our plan assumes that.","Andrew Levi","Could that plan change, or should we just assume that, that's kind of locked in?","Thomas L. Hanson","We always reassess our needs. But what we're trying to do is at least, as a planning assumption, provide an indication that right now, we would anticipate issuing up to $150 million of equity.","Andrew Levi","So let me ask the question another way. I'm good at that. What would cause you not to need to issue that much equity if there is anything?","Thomas L. Hanson","Certainly, changing cash flows would be a significant contributor. Recognizing the reason we're issuing the equity is to maintain our target equity ratios at the 2 equal utilities. So again, that's the primary driver. So to the extent that we would see incremental earnings at the 2 utilities, additional cash flows, certainly, that would suggest that $150 million could be potentially reduced.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Does bonus depreciation or the extension of that have any bearing on it?","Thomas L. Hanson","Very little, because our NOL positions now would take us through 2016.","Andrew Levi","Got it, okay. So it sounds like it's pretty locked in.","Thomas L. Hanson","It's a planning assumption, Andy.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other members of the senior management team.","Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy's second quarter 2013 earnings and reaffirmed 2013 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different.","Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We have had another good quarter. We continue to have solid earnings, constructive regulatory decisions, good progress on our construction projects and high customer satisfaction. Alliant Energy customers again ranked us high in the J.D. Power and Associates 2013 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study. We remain on the top quartile in the Midwest large segment, and our overall satisfaction score continues to improve. We are very proud of this J.D. Power recognition, and it is a tribute to all of our dedicated men and women that provide exceptional customer service every day. Pardon me.","On the regulatory front, we recently have had several positive developments. First, we received a good order at FERC addressing the complaint IPL filed in 2012 as it relates to who should pay for network upgrade cost driven by generator interconnects in our IPL service territory. We challenged ITC Midwest MISO Attachment FF, which allows generator owners to receive 100% reimbursement of these costs from ITC Midwest. While the new generators received favorable treatment, the ITC cost associated with these upgrades are passed through to our customers through higher revenue requirements. In Iowa and Minnesota, customers of the other utilities are not responsible for subsidizing network upgrades driven by generator interconnections in their service territories. With this FERC decision, our IPL customers will be treated the same as the other customers in Iowa and Minnesota.","The network upgrade costs already incurred are not insignificant. The revenue requirement included in IPL's customer rates for 2013 is about $25 million higher given the 100% reimbursement policy as compared to the standard MISO tariff. The FERC order does require MISO to revise the ITC Midwest FF tariff to conform with the standard MISO Attachment FF tariff. The new reimbursement policy will be in effect for all generator interconnect agreements executed or filed with FERC after July 18, 2013.","As typical with all orders issued by FERC, there is a 30-day window for intervenors to seek a rehearing and\/or stay. It is difficult to predict when this order will be final, given we are still in the 30-day window. Once the order is final, we will evaluate any potential changes to the rate base associated with future transmission projects and related capital expenditures.","I am also pleased to report that last week, IPL reached a partial settlement with the Office of Consumer Advocate and other interested parties in our 5-year energy efficiency plan for years 2014 through 2018. This partial settlement agreement is consistent with our goal of working closely with interested stakeholders to obtain fair and timely regulatory outcomes. Our plan includes spending approximately $400 million over the 5-year period for electric and gas energy efficiency programs in Iowa. The planned spending and energy efficiency savings are relatively the same as IPL's previous 5-year plan. The IUB is expected to make a decision on the plan by the end of the year, and the expenses will flow through IPL's energy efficiency cost recovery rider.","As we discussed in our first quarter call in April, Alliance Energy's Wisconsin subsidiary, WP&L, reached a settlement with the EPA and the Sierra Club, which was approved by the U.S. district court in June. The terms of the settlement are consistent with WPL's energy resource plan announced in 2012, and a majority of their emissions control are currently under construction or completed.","The SCR for Edgewater Unit 5 was completed last year, and the baghouse and scrubber have been approved by the PSCW at an estimated cost of $410 million excluding AFUDC. Construction is expected to begin in 2014 and be completed in 2016.","For our Columbia units, the construction of a baghouse and scrubber at both units is on time and on budget and is expected to be completed in 2014. The settlement also requires the installation of an SCR at Columbia Unit 2, which we plan to seek approval from the PSCW in the second quarter of 2014. Our share of the construction expenditure is estimated to be between $100 million and $125 million. The majority of the spend for the SCR occurs in 2017 and 2018 with an in-service date of 2018.","We are also continuing to evaluate improvements that will increase the efficiency and generating capacity of our existing generating units. Earlier this week we filed a certificate of authority application with the PSCW for authorization to replace 12 coal pulverizers and upgrade the 2 steam turbines at Columbia Units 1 and 2. The new technology will reduce the heat rate and expected to increase the operating capacity of the units. The total estimated cost of the project is $130 million and WPL's share is $60 million, excluding AFUDC. We anticipate a decision from the commission in the third quarter next year and completion of this project in 2017. This project is in our current capital expenditure guidance.","In Iowa, construction is also progressing well at the installation of baghouses and scrubbers at Ottumwa and MidAmerican's Neal 3 and 4 units. The Neal 4 project will be in service later this year, and the Ottumwa and Neal 3 projects are expected to be in service in 2014.","I'll now update you on the progress of our proposed Marshalltown Generating Station in Iowa. IPL and the OCA reached a settlement agreement, which includes a $700 million price cap, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The proposed settlement also includes the return on common equity of 11% for the depreciable life of the facility and the use of a 10.3% return on common equity for the calculation of AFUDC.","At the end of April, we filed a settlement agreement with the Iowa Utilities Board. In May, the hearing for Marshalltown was held and the only board member present was IUB Chair Libby Jacobs. Briefs and reply briefs have since been filed, and the record is complete. However, since the hearing, Nick Wagner and Sheila Tipton had been appointed as new board members. We do not believe that the absence of the full board at the Marshalltown hearing will significantly impact the timing of the IUB decision, which we expect to receive later this year.","The IUB's decision to grant us a certificate for construction will be contingent upon IPL receiving all necessary permits and other regulatory approvals, including the air permit from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and approval for construction of a natural gas pipeline.","As we have discussed in the past, an important piece of IPL's resource plan is the new Duane Arnold Energy Center PPA. All cost of the new DAEC PPA will flow through the Energy Adjustment Clause starting in February 2014. Intervenors raised concerns in the DAEC PPA docket about the potential double recovery of capacity cost if IPL does not file a new base rate case in 2014, since $135 million of DAEC capacity payments are currently included in base rates.","We continue to work with the various stakeholders on a settlement to extend the current 3-year electric base rate freeze that expires at the end of this year. We are proposing to stabilize electric retail base rates at the current levels until the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station is placed in service, which is currently expected in April of 2017.","The base rates stabilization proposal includes the utilization of approximately $230 million remaining tax benefit rider funds available in the regulatory liability to offset future retail electric bills for Iowa customers. If a base rate stabilization agreement cannot be reached, the electric base rate case filed in early 2014 will eliminate the revenue requirement of the DAEC capacity cost and would include recovery of and return on rate base additions of approximately $500 million, as well as other changes in revenue requirements since our last base rate case test year of 2009.","Depending on the outcome of the potential 2014 rate case, there could also be a potential need for additional rate cases before 2017 since the proposed base rates stabilization plan takes a multi-year view and provides base rate and Tax Benefit Rider certainty for our customers.","Let me summarize the key messages. We expect to continue to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout targets. We are making great progress transforming our generating portfolio to one that is balanced with lower emissions and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations. We are focused on working safely, providing exceptional customer service and improving reliability. We'll manage our company focusing on operational and financial discipline with the goal of earning our authorized returns while minimizing customer rate volatility and increases. And finally, we will continue to work closely with our regulators and stakeholders to receive fair and timely outcomes.","Thank you for your interest in Alliance Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, everyone. Today, we released our second quarter 2013 earnings. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $0.59 per share, which is $0.01 per share increase over second quarter of 2012. The lack of capacity charges related to the Riverside PPA in 2013 resulted in a positive variance of $0.11 per share for the quarter. Other positive drivers were a 2013 revenue requirement adjustment related to IPL's tax initiatives and lower energy conservation cost recovery amortizations at WPL. These EPS positive drivers were partially offset by lower earnings resulting from weather impacts on sales, higher WPL depreciation expense and quarter-over-quarter timing impacts from IPL's electric and gas Tax Benefit Riders.","Second quarter comparisons between 2013 and 2012 earnings per share are detailed on supplemental slides 2, 3 and 4. In our consolidated earnings guidance walk between 2012 and 2013, which has been provided in our investor relations presentations, we highlighted several drivers for the forecasted year-over-year earnings results.","One of the largest drivers is the forecasted $0.29 per share increase in earnings due to lower purchase power capacity cost, primarily related to the Riverside Energy Center, which WPL purchased on December 31, 2012. To assist modeling quarterly earnings projections, please note that of the $60 million annual Riverside capacity payments in 2012, approximately $6 million was paid in the first quarter, $20 million was paid in second quarter, $28 million was paid in the third quarter, and $6 million was paid in the fourth quarter.","We are reaffirming our 2013 consolidated earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.25 a share. While we were pleased with the results for the first half of the year, we are a third quarter company due to summer peak and summer rates, thus, we are not making changes to our guidance at this time. The 2013 -- the July 2013 estimated weather impact was normal. By comparison, the extremely hot weather in July 2012 had an approximately $0.18 per share positive impact on earnings.","The economy on our service territories continues to slowly improve. The forecasted 2013 total electric retail sales reflect relatively flat weather normalized sales when compared to 2012. Sales trends between forecasted 2013 and weather normalized 2012 by customer class are illustrated on supplemental Slide 5.","The forecasted decrease in IPL's industrial sales in 2013 over 2012 weather normalized sales is due to cogeneration customer outages last year, which increased IPL's industrial sales in the first quarter 2012. Excluding sales to IPL cogeneration customers, industrial sales would have -- would be relatively flat comparing forecasted 2013 to 2012.","IPL's electric and gas Tax Benefit Riders are expected to have no earnings impact for 2013, just like they had no earnings impact in 2011 or 2012. The forecasted quarterly earnings impact of the 2013 electric and gas Tax Benefit Riders, as well as the actual quarterly earnings impact of the 2012 electric Tax Benefit Rider, are provided in supplemental Slide 6.","Turning to our financing plans. Cash flows from operation are expected to remain strong. Please note that the 2013 cash flows are impacted by reduced customer build in accordance with IPL's Tax Benefit Riders. Our current 2013 financing plan anticipates issuing long-term debt of up to $300 million at IPL in the fourth quarter. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. Therefore, we do not plan to issue any material new common equity in 2013. Our future financing plans will be significantly influenced by the timing of construction expenditures, including the proposed Marshalltown facility Pat discussed earlier. We expect to announce our 2014 financing plan later this year.","Supplemental Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling our forecasted 2013 effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. Turning to our regulatory calendar. We have made significant progress to-date on the 2013 regulatory dockets, which are summarized on Slide 8. We are waiting 2 major decisions yet this year, which are the construction authorization and rate making principles for the proposed Marshalltown generating facility and approval of our 5-year energy efficiency plant.","In addition to these proceedings, we continue discussions with the OCA and other stakeholders regarding our proposed electric base rate stabilization plan, which would continue until the anticipated in-service date of Marshalltown generating facility, which is scheduled for April 2017.","We very much appreciate your continued support of the company. We look forward to meeting with many of you in August and September.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Maybe you could just comment on a little further on the weather normalized year-over-year sales changes on Slide 5 and there seems to be a divergence between IPL versus WPL. Just wondering if you can give a little color on maybe the different service territories.","Thomas L. Hanson","Well, as we look at the residential sector, we would not really see any significant differences. Simply there's a difference in the industrial sector. But as I stated, the IPL is somewhat artificially low because of the additional sales that we had with cogeneration customers that we had last year. So if you adjust for that, the profile would be similar between the 2 states. And again from our perspective, again sales are relatively flat. Certainly, we see some slight signs of improvement but nothing that would suggest that we change our forecast.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And correct me if I'm wrong, but the IUB granted an oral decision approving Marshalltown. Is that accurate?","Patricia L. Kampling","No, that's not accurate, Brian. We reached settlement with the OCA, and that -- part of it is proceeding right now but we have not received any order from the IUB yet.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is there a procedural schedule when that order is expected?","Patricia L. Kampling","No, there is not. But we still expect it in the fourth quarter, though.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then remind us what the drag on the merchant wind farm is in 2013, and are there any initiatives to maybe mitigate that in '14 and beyond?","Thomas L. Hanson","The amount that we have in our forecast here is a $0.05 drag on earnings for Franklin County. Much of that is attributable to the transmission congestion that occurred in 2013. There are steps underway that would remedy that, would suggest that, that certainly would have a probably less of a loss, if I can characterize it that way, going into 2014.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, just on the IPL rate stabilization plan, at what point to you just stop discussions and just prepare to file a rate case, and when would that occur? I believe you filed in March and also self-implement.","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, Brian, we'll be going down parallel paths on this. We need to be prepared to have to file a rate case, but at the same time, we'll continue discussions with all parties up to that point and even including after the point when we filed the case if we have to go down that path but it will be a parallel path at this point.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Revisiting on the Franklin County topic maybe, Pat, if you could just parse it into 2 topics. So if you were to resolve some of the transmission constraints that might allow you to sell the output. But maybe talk a little bit about efforts to contract the asset, which might make it a little bit easier to sell and potentially mitigate some of the equity needs in '15.","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. Jay, really nothing has changed on Franklin County at this point. We're pleased to report that the performance has been going very well and the transmission constraints are getting alleviated as we speak. But we're still looking at all the options on what to do with that facility at this point, so there's really nothing to report on that.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","But it's fair to say -- I guess, where I'm going and maybe I overstep my bounds there, it's fair to say you are attempting to contract it, but certainly you've got to resolve the transmission constraints in order to get those parties more willing to contract?","Patricia L. Kampling","I would say we're looking at multiple options at this point, Jay. It's not just one option we're looking at, at this point.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, fair enough. And then, Tom, to the $0.18 benefit on weather, if I take that and sort of assume normal weather for the third quarter but then say, well, Riverside is going to be $28 million benefit of the absence of the capacity charge netted obviously against some depreciation and then the sort of net benefit of the Tax Benefit Rider, which should be about $0.02 assuming sort of flat, but you ought to be able to offset that weather impact. Am I thinking about that right?","Thomas L. Hanson","I'm thinking, here, Jay. Well, let's look at individual pieces. Certainly, July was extreme last year in terms of -- for the quarter, it was $0.20. So for the month of July, it was $0.18. Our forecast assumes that it would be weather normalized. Certainly, we are getting a benefit because of Riverside. Again, that's in our guidance, and we also were a third quarter company, both in terms of sales and with our summer rates. So the third quarter always is the largest of the 4 quarters. And also if you go back to the guidance that we provided in terms of the walk going from '12 to '13, hopefully, we will try to identify those individual items, and really our focus is more on the annual basis as opposed to a quarter-over-quarter basis. The reason we just wanted to call out the July weather effect is because it was so significant last year.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Oh, yes, no, exactly, and I think that's great call out. I just want to weigh it against $28 million of the capacity charge absence would be about $0.16 a share, roughly, and then it looks like you get, roughly, $0.02 of benefit from the comparative benefit of the Tax Benefit Rider. So no, that's fine. And then maybe just last question on operating costs. I know you've had, Pat, a lot of focus on continuing to manage and reduce cost just from a continuous improvement and productivity point of view. So how are those efforts going? And sort of do you continue to see a lot of wood to chop there as far as opportunity to manage costs.","Patricia L. Kampling","I would tell you I think we've done a fantastic job over the last couple of years of identifying these items and reducing costs. We expect cost to be remain relatively flat. Again, a lot of the benefits from our cost reductions have been the conversion of our -- some of our coal facilities to gas. We don't have any of those coming down in next couple of years at least major savings, but we would expect our O&M to remain relatively flat until we add new facilities to the portfolio.","Operator","We'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Pat, I just wanted to get your view on M&A in the sector. One of your neighbors, since your last earnings call, went in and bought something on the West. I just wanted to understand how you look at M&A in terms of shareholders' return and everything from your perspective?","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure. No, firstly, I just want to say that we are very focused on our very large capital expenditure program that we have right now, and we have very good earnings growth just organically with all the work that we're doing here at the company. I could tell you the lens that we look at M&A's the same lens that our neighbors are looking at. You want to accretive earnings, you want to make sure that there's benefits to the share owners. In this environment right now a lot of the last few M&As, the regulators put some constraints on, savings that the utilities could achieve through synergies. So we're looking at it with the same lens that everybody else is, it has to be very good for the shareowner. But right now, really focused on deploying the capital that we have in our plans right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","I wanted to elaborate on the approval for the rate freeze related to Marshalltown. You mentioned that there are 2 new commissioners in Iowa. How involved will they be in approving the deal with the OCA? And will they need to be confirmed before they're able to rule? My understanding is that it won't happen until after next year. But will they be involved in this decision in the fourth quarter as you're expecting or by the fourth quarter?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. And just to be clear, they're actually -- they are able to vote. They'll have to be reconfirmed next year. That might be the confusion that you have on that, but they are standing members. Sheila won't be on the board until middle of August, but they will be able to vote on the proceedings. And again we don't expect any delays. The record is very clear. It's complete. So we'll just have to see how this progresses, but they are 2 very qualified board members that have been appointed.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. Great. That's helpful, and then lastly, you talked quite a bit about updated cost estimates for the environmental controls, but the slide showing the details wasn't there. I can go through the transcript later, but I was hoping you could just maybe point of some of what's changed since the last slide deck, particularly around the recent EPA settlement?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, actually nothing has changed on the CapEx for the environmental controls.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Bischof of Morningstar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for you this morning relating to strategy. Recently, the Wisconsin State budget called for the divestiture of state-owned generation assets. Is that something that Alliant will interested in looking at?","Patricia L. Kampling","No, we're not interested in looking at those, we're just really focused on improving the performance for our fleet. So we actually have no intention of looking at that at all.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Just a very quick question. There was, I mean, the call was very clear. There was just one thing that kind of piqued my interest, and I don't know if I heard it right or if it even was meaningful, so I just want to get some clarification on it. But you had made some reference about when you were talking about the transmission and the revaluation of rate base or CapEx relative to -- I guess was relative to the ITC FERC decision, but can you just explain what you meant by that, and whether it's significant or not significant?","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure. The question is that with this new FERC order, any new generation that we'd be placing in service, we could be responsible for the transmission, which would be a change to the rate base then. But again it's too early to speculate on that. But that's what the question is. So any new generation that we'd be putting in service could be our costs that would be paying for the transmission.","Andrew Levi","And that would kind of -- that would be additive to CapEx and additive to rate base.","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, yes, exactly.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So that was a positive thing that you were referring to?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Eli Kraicer [ph] with Millennium.","Steven M. Gambuzza - Longbow Capital Partners, L.P.","It's Steve Gambuzza. In your comments, you talked about the need for gas pipe infrastructure for the Marshalltown this GT [ph]. Is that included in the capital forecast? And do you have to go through a separate siting and approval process to construct that infrastructure?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, actually, the answer to both of those are yes. And the good news with that facility is we already have all the easements in place for the pipeline, but it's a separate docket at the IUB.","Steven M. Gambuzza - Longbow Capital Partners, L.P.","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Andy Levi's question. Are you currently evaluating this change in the FERC transmission structure? Will you provide some kind of update on what that change might mean for the generation investments you're making or is it not anticipated to be significant?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. No, I think in the transmission planning it's still in its early stages for the Marshalltown facility but our current estimate would be again this is our current estimate would be an increase of rate base if we were to pay for it about $145 million.","Steven M. Gambuzza - Longbow Capital Partners, L.P.","$145 million. And given that you don't own any transmission -- am I correct that you no longer own any transmission at IP&L, currently. Is that correct?","Patricia L. Kampling","That's correct.","Steven M. Gambuzza - Longbow Capital Partners, L.P.","So would that the -- would this $145 million be FERC jurisdictional rate base or would it be part of your state jurisdictional rate base?","Patricia L. Kampling","It would be state.","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we'll have time to take questions from the Investment community.","We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy's third quarter 2013 earnings guidance, updating 2013 earnings guidance and providing 2013 through 2017 capital expenditure guidance. We also issued 2014 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor Page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With Veteran's Day just a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy, to those veterans that are on call with us today. We thank you for your service to our country, and for protecting our freedom. This morning, we issued a press release that provided third quarter results, and increased our 2013 earnings guidance. We also provided earnings guidance and our targeted common stock dividend levels for 2014. As finally, we updated our capital expenditure plans through 2017.","Tom will provide more details on all the financial updates, but in summary, I am pleased to let you know that for 2013 we\u2019ve been successful at managing our company in accordance with our operating plan. The $0.13 increase in the midpoint of our annual guidance was primarily driven by $0.11 of positive weather impacts through the third quarter. Now looking at next year, the midpoint of our guidance for 2014 is $3.40 per share, 9% higher than a projected weather normalized 2013 guidance of $3.12 per share. This earnings increase comes from increased margins, created by our ability to use expiring fixed capacity payments at both utilities to offset rate impacts from rate-based additions. Our long-term earnings growth objective continues to be 5% to 7% based on 2012 weather normalized earnings and 2014's guidance is slightly above that range at 7.7%.","Supplemental Slide 2 provides the comparison to our 2012 weather normalized earnings base year, current midpoint of our 2013 estimated weather normalized earnings, and the 2014 earnings guidance midpoint. We also announced this morning, a targeted 2014 common dividend level of $2.04 per share, which represents an 8.5% increase from our current annual dividend of $1.88 per share. The dividend target is consistent, with our long-term targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. As we look at 2014, WPL will be in the last year of the approved rate freeze. They are currently analyzing our options for 2015, '16 test year and expect to work with other parties, as we did with 2013, 2014 test years.","Several key regulatory metrics will be addressed at IPL in 2014, including the treatment of the capacity payments related to the current DAEC PPA, the expiration of our 3-year Iowa Retail Electric base rate freeze, earning a return on a significant amount of capital we have deployed since 2009, extension of the transmission rider, and the determination of the timing of the electric tax benefit rate of funds to be credited to customers in future years. Also critical, is the approval and sort of construction of the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station. As part of the DAEC PPA approval, all the costs of the new agreement will flow through the energy adjustment clause and it will be effective in February 2014. In addition, we agreed to file a rate case without interim rates or reach a settlement with intervenors in early 2014. This agreement was meant to alleviate concerns that intervenors raised about the proceeds double recovery of the $135 million of capacity payments that were included in the 2009 test year base rates.","As we play for 2014, we are prepared to file an Iowa Electric base rate case in early March, based on a 2013 test year, and will include known and natural adjustments through 2014. This case will eliminate the revenue requirement for DAEC capacity costs, but would include the revenue requirements for the recovery of a return on the rate-based additions of approximately $500 million, as well as other changes in revenue requirements since our last base rate case test year of 2009. If the revenue requirement approved the 2013 test year case, is lower than current rates, than a refund would be required and will be calculated starting on February 22, 2014, which is when the existing DAEC contract expires. Depending on the outcome of this case, there could also be a need for additional rate cases before 2017 when the Marshalltown Generating Station is placed in service.","Although we are prepared to file a rate case, we will continue to work with various stakeholders on a settlement, which will provide multi-year electric base rate certainty for our customers. Let me provide a quick update on our proposed Marshalltown Generating Station.","Prior to the IUB hearing, IPL and the OCA reached a settlement agreement on the dockets that included a $700 million cost cap excluding AFUDC in transmission costs, a return on common equity of 11% for the depreciable life of the facility, and the use of a 10.3% return on common equity for calculation of AFUDC. At the May IUB hearing, only Chair Libby Jacobs was in attendance. 2 new board members, Nick Wagner and Sheila Tipton have now been appointed, but they were not in their roles at the time of the hearing.","Because of this unusual circumstance, Chair Jacobs will issue a proposed decision and order, which would become final -- which would become the final order unless the full board or another party appeals the decision within 15 days after issuance. If there is an appeal, IPL and other parties will then have 14 days to respond. Following these steps, the IUB can set up a particular schedule to address the appeals or it can enter an order. In addition to the IUB's decision to grant a certificate for the construction, an air permit must be received from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and the IUB must approve the construction of a natural gas pipeline for the facility.","These filings have been made and are now proceeding on schedule. I'm pleased to report that last month, we received the oral decisions for the IUB approving our energy efficiency plan for 2014 through 2018, which is consistent with both our initial filings and the partial settlement we reached with the parties. The plan calls for approximately $400 million to be spent over the next 5 years, and such expenditures will continue to flow through IPL's Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Rider. We expect a written order from this proceeding by the end of this year.","Both IPL and WPL have a long history of promoting and supporting energy efficiency, and our customers benefited from these programs for decades. I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made, and continue to make in transitioning the environmental profile of our fossil generating fleet. Recently, the Edgewater 5 SCR project was named for fast global energy award finalist in a premier project engineering category. Edgewater 5 SCR, which was completed at the end of 2012 was designed to exceed the required nitrogen oxide emission reductions, while sustaining its operational flexibilities.","The 380-megawatt nameplate Edgewater Unit 5 has one of the widest operating ranges of any generating unit in the industry, that the capability to operate from 13% to 100% of capacity. This is a well-deserved recognition and I applaud and thank the Alliant Energy employees and contractors that contributed to the success of this project. Now, let me quickly brief you on our current emission control construction activities. We currently have over 1,000 contract workers on our properties assisting with these important projects. The construction of the scrubber and baghouse at Ottumwa facility is approximately 70% complete and on budget and is expected to be in service in 2014. In addition, the mid-American is currently installing baghouses and scrubbers at Neal Units 3 & 4.","The Neal 4 project is 95% complete and will be placed in service shift this year. The Neal 3 project is approximately 80% complete, and will be placed in service in the second quarter of 2014. It was constant construction of the baghouses and scrubbers at Columbia's 1 & 2 is progressing well and is approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be in service in the first half of 2014 and was factored into WPL Electric rate case settlement for 2014. Since the project at Ottumwa, Columbia and Neal began construction prior to 2014, and will be placed in service in 2014, they all will qualify for 50% bonus depreciation, that was extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act earlier this year. The additional tax deductions from these projects of approximately $250 million will assist us in reducing rate base and thereby lowering costs for our customers.","The construction authorization from the PSCW for a scrubber and baghouse and Edgewater Unit 5 included a cost estimate of $410 million. We now expect this project to cost approximately $300 million, as a result of the successful execution of our competitive bidding process, contract negotiations, and favorable market conditions. The construction is still expected to begin in 2014 and be completed in 2016. We have reflected these lower capital expenditures and our updated capital expenditure guidance. In addition to the progress we are making on transforming our Tier 1 units, we're also making progress in preparing our Tier 2 plants to be compliant with the utility, mercury and air toxic standard or U MACT by the April 2015 deadline.","We are currently installing low cost controllers at our Prairie Creek and Burlington generating stations, and we continue to evaluate our other Tier unit options to comply with the rules. From an environmental perspective, we are fortunate that all of our coal facilities are in Powder River Basin coal, which is not only economical, but also makes environmental compliance less costly. We are well-positioned to ensure a balanced, flexible and environmentally compliant generating fleet, that will serve our customers well.","We provided an updated capital expenditure plan this morning, which is provided on supplemental slide 3. The walks on a previous to current capital expenditure guidance is provided on supplemental slide 4. Tom will provide additional details regarding these changes in a few minutes. The primary drivers for the capital expenditure changes are updated cost estimates for the environmental projects and the timing of the spend at Marshalltown Generating Station, and the transmission network upgrades that will now be our responsibility based on FERC's July 2013 decision on attachment FF, as supposed to collection through future transmission billings from ITC Midwest.","We are providing guidance based on these current rules and regulations, although FERC's decision on attachment FF matter has been appealed. The transmission network upgrades shown on our capital expenditure guidance relate to IPL's proposed Marshalltown Generating Station, and WPL's Bent Tree Wind project, which together are currently estimated at $195 million excluding AFUDC. Another addition to our 5-year capital expenditure plan is the potential new resource for WP&L. As a part of our long-term resource planning efforts, WPL is conducting a feasibility study of resource options to address future customer needs.","We believe that a new resource will be needed in 2019 with the previously disclosed retirement of at least 3 units and with constant over the next few years. Several options under consideration, range from conversion of an existing simple cycle facility to a newly built combined cycle facility. We anticipate the analysis to be completed next year, and the filing with the PSCW will be made at the end of 2014. Our capital estimates are based on a new 300-megawatt natural gas flight generating facility and truly determine desired resource.","The WPL and IPL split of our capital expenditures as well as the updated rate base estimates for 2013 to 2016 will be provided in the EEI Investor Presentation Slide deck, which will posted to our website yet this week. I'd now like to update you on some positive economic developments in our service territory. The economy remains stable for both Iowa and Wisconsin. Unemployment rates are below the national average with Iowa's rate at 4.9% and was concentrated at 6.2%. We are seeing improvement in the number of customers and a slight improvement in use per customer. During the past year, the number of electric customers are up by 0.4%, and for gas customers, 6.6%. Its good to see positive economic trends in our service territory, that are modestly affecting our sales volume. Let me summarize my key messages for today.","We will continue to manage the company striking a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost-impacted customers. We have a plan that will continue to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We\u2019re having a solid 2013, an increase in midpoint of our 2013 consolidated earnings guidance to reflect the benefits of weather and have provided earnings and dividend guidance for 2014. We're making progress transforming our generation portfolio to one that is balanced with lower emissions, and has a flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations, while economically meeting our energy capacity needs of our customers. We continue to work closely with our regulators and stakeholders to receive fair and timely outcomes.","And finally, I must acknowledge and give thanks to our dedicated workforce, which not only provides outstanding service to our customers, but also delivers the financial results that we are discussing today. We're also experiencing our safest year as company, and will continue to look out for one another and for our customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant's Energy and I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter earnings this morning, with our GAAP earnings from continuing operations at $1.43 per share. There are no earnings adjustments this quarter. 2013 third quarter earnings are higher than third quarter 2012, primarily due to purchase power capacity costs, related to the Riverside Energy Center, and lower income tax expense. The higher earnings were partially offset by lower quarter-over-quarter earnings attributed to weather, and higher depreciation expense, primarily resulting from the purchase of Riverside.","Comparisons between the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 earnings per share are detailed on supplemental Slides 5 and 6. The third quarter 2013 weather resulted in positive earnings from higher electric sales of $0.07 per share. However this is $0.13 lower than third quarter 2012 weather impact of $0.20 per share. Year-to-date, weather has increased earnings of $0.11 in 2013. As a result, we have increased the 2013 consolidated earnings guidance range to $3.15 to $3.30 per share. We have seen modest weather normalized sales growth in 2013.","Retail sales trends between 2013 -- 2012 and 2013 are illustrated in supplemental Slide 7. IPL's Tax Benefit Riders resulted in a $0.02 quarter-over-quarter variation in the third quarter 2013, when compared to third quarter 2012. The actual and projected quarterly earnings impact of the 2013 Tax Benefit Riders, as well as the actual quarterly earnings impact of the 2012 Tax Benefit Rider is provided in supplemental Slide 8. The Tax Benefit Riders have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated to impact full year 2013 results. The walk from the 2012 to the 2013 projected effective tax rates for IPL, WPL, and AEC, is provided on supplemental Slide 9. Now, let's review our 2014 guidance. This morning, we issued our consolidated 2014 guidance range of $3.25 to $3.55 earnings per share.","A walk from the midpoint of the 2013 to 2014 estimated guidance range is shown on supplemental Slide 10. Starting with our utilities, the 2014 guidance assumes normal weather, modest sale increases as profiled in supplemental Slide 11, and is based upon the impacts of WPL's previously announced electric and gas retail rate freezes and assumptions about IPL's expected electric base rate case outcome. In 2012, WPL froze base rates for 2013 and 2014.","The WPL rate freeze reflected electric rate base growth as a result of placing the Columbia's scrubber and baghouse projects in service in 2014. The increase in electric revenue requirement for 2014 for this and other rate base additions was offset by the net impact of lower purchase power capacity costs from the DAEC PPA, which expires at the end of 2013, and higher conservation expense resulting in no change WP&L's retail electric customers base rate in 2014. Our 2014 guidance range assumes that WPL earns its authorized return on common equity of 10.4%.","Now turning to IPL. The increase in rate base during our 3-year rate freeze has not allowed IPL to earn its authorized return on common equity. We have constructed our 2014 guidance based upon earnings, our current authorized return on equity, which resulted in inclusion of a regulatory reserve in our guidance. We have assumed the transmission and energy cost riders remain in effect. Our rate case filing will consider a number of factors, which could have affect the final revenue requirement, including changes in depreciation expense, a change in amortization amounts for regulatory assets, and\/or a lower total revenue requirement when compared to current rates resulting in a potential refund.","We plan to share additional details of our test year 2013 rate case, when filing the case. We expect to reach a constructive outcome in 2014 to a rate case or settlement, which allows us to earn an appropriate return -- rate of return on our investor rate base. Pension expense is currently expected to be approximately $0.05 per share lower in 2014 due to increases in the discount rates and asset returns. These amounts will be updated at year-end, when determining the actual 2014 pension expense. The current funded status of our pension plan is approximately 95%. Given the changes experienced in the income tax expense in 2014, supplemental Slide 12 has been provided to assist you in modeling our forecasted 2014 effective tax rates at IPL, WPL and AEC.","Finally, we turn to the 2014 earnings projections for the parent and nonregulated businesses. We expect the transportation business to maintain steady earnings between $0.11 and $0.13 per share. We also expect the Franklin County Wind Farm to sell power into the wholesale market with lower transmission constraints, resulting in a forecasted $0.02 per share pickup for 2014, when compared to 2013. In addition to our updated earning guidance, we updated our capital expenditures plans as shown on supplemental Slides 3 and 4. Our 2014 capital expenditure plan increased by approximately $200 million, primarily due to the changes in the timing of the Marshalltown Generating Station expenditures, and the addition of the transmission upgrade expenditures as a result of FERC's attachment FF decision in July 2013.","Cash flows from operations are expected to be very strong given the earnings generated by the business. We will also benefit given we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2016, primarily due to the additional bonus depreciation Pat noted earlier. These strong cash flows will be partially reduced by credits to customers billed, in accordance with IPL's Tax Benefit Riders.","Turning to our financing plans. We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our target liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. Our financing plan assumes we will receive IUB approval of the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station and that the sale of our Minnesota distribution assets closes in 2014. The estimated sales proceeds of approximately $128 million from our Minnesota asset sale are expected to be used to offset IPL's future financing needs.","The Minnesota distribution asset sale requires state and federal regulatory approvals. Our current financing plan anticipates issuing up to $300 million dollars of long-term debt at both IPL and WPL in the later half of 2014. We also anticipate issuing up to $250 million in aggregate of new common equity in 2015 and 2016. We do not currently plan to issue any material new common equity in 2014. We may adjust our plans as being prudent if market conditions warrant. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for the rest of 2013 and 2014, which we have summarized in Slide 13.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting you -- with you at EEI. The slides to be discussed at EEI will be posted on our website as we do with all of our Investor Relations conference slides.","At this time, I'll turn the call back to the operator to facilitate a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","If you could just reiterate about what you said earlier on the bonus depreciation, I think it was $250 million deduction to rate base. Where did that fall in the IPL or WPL?","Patricia L. Kampling","Both, it was the 3 projects at Neal, and some of which would be IPL and Columbia which would be WP&L.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that -- that's reduction to the '13 rate base?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. When they going into service.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","When they are going into service?","Patricia L. Kampling","Which should be end of '14.","Thomas L. Hanson","And Brian, the slide that we will be posting here either today or tomorrow will reflect that in terms of the rate base from the schedules you've seen before.","Patricia L. Kampling","And the $250 million, Brain, is the deduction.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right. It's a deduction in your rate base, and I guess that kind of offset by the incremental transmission spend?","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure, Brian. It's the tax deduction.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Oh, tax deduction. Got you.","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure, just want to be clear.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Tax deduction, not a rate base deduction.","Patricia L. Kampling","That's correct.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Does it have an impact on rate base?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. Of course","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I think you mentioned earlier that you going to provide the CapEx breakdown by the IPL and WPL also in the EEI presentation?","Thomas L. Hanson","That's correct, Brian.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the Franklin County, pickup in 2014, you mind sharing kind of like the year-over-year improvement in capacity factors.","Thomas L. Hanson","Through September, the capacity factor was approximately 25%, and that reflected in improvement in the transmission line that was completed in the second quarter, we're expecting further improvement due to additional transmission lines that will be done in 2014. So we would expect that cap factor is probably going to get certainly closer to 30%, if not slightly above the 30%.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the equity needs that you need in, I think it's '14 or '15 and '16, could that be kind of handled under some sort of driven[ph] program?","Thomas L. Hanson","Certainly that's an option. Whether it's driven, [ph] whether it's for a 1k needs and what not. So all those options are items that will need to be considering.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Pat just lastly, you've been spending quite a bit on environmental retrofits, et cetera, and I was just curious as to your thoughts on the EPA's carbon standards on existing fleets that are due in June of '14? I mean under what's proposed now, would your goal plans meet that standard?","Patricia L. Kampling","Again, what's proposed right now has to do with a lot of the new construction, which again we\u2019re not proposing any new coal construction. What's being discussed that I wouldn\u2019t even say proposed at this point, we'll be working with EEI and rest of industry, on what we think the rules for the existing plans need to be, Brian.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] .We will go next to Ela Gratia with Millenium.","Steven Gambuzza","It's Steven Gambuzza. I just wanted to follow up on Brian's question on the deductions for deferred taxes at the environmental units. I know there are differences in how you account for deferred taxes in Iowa, and Wisconsin. Can you just repeat -- is this a reduction to rate base? And if so, I know you had previously provided rate base forecast for 2015 in your last investor presentation, should we -- were those forecasts including the impact of these deferred tax benefits or not?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes, if you recall back in our January call that we made some reference that because of the of the enactment of Taxpayer Release Act that there would be continuing depreciation, so this is reflecting those projects that were started in 2013 that would be placed in service in 2014. As Pat mentioned in her script, the $250 million is the deduction that will take in the tax return, you multiply that times your tax rates. So it's about a $100 million reduction in rate base. Some of that will be split at IPL and WPL, and as I said, the rate base slides that we will be sharing reflect that reduction because of the incremental bonus depreciation.","Steven Gambuzza","So it's not in the old presentation rate base forecast, but it will be on a new one?","Thomas L. Hanson","It was footnoted in the old, it will be in the bar graphs with the new.","Steven Gambuzza","Okay. And then I just wanted to make sure, just clarify the comment on the -- you said you did not earn your allowed ROE in Iowa in 2013, and you would -- the midpoint of your guidance would reflect earning your allowed ROE in 2014? Is that correct?","Thomas L. Hanson","That's correct.","Steven Gambuzza","And it's -- and to the kind of parameters are 10% return on equity and a 48% equity layer? Is that right?","Thomas L. Hanson","That's reasonable, yes.","Steven Gambuzza","Okay. And then just the tax rate, 2014 versus 2013, is it -- is there any change in the -- I think you said 20% in 2014 effective, what was it in 2013?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes. If we go to, on Slide 9, the effective tax rate was 12%, and then on slide 12 for 2014, the estimate is 20%.","Steven Gambuzza","Okay. And the change in that tax rate, has some of that reflected in some of the regulatory riders you have? Or is that -- how did that...","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes. Certainly the biggest rider would be at IPL with the Tax Benefit Rider, and also we do have some flow throughs whether that relates to repairs or mixed up service cost that also influence that and given the fact we have flow-through in Iowa. That's what tends to move your IPL effective tax rate around more than you would see certainly in Wisconsin because of the tax treatment here.","Operator","We'll go next Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to ask the 2014 guidance, like you said is a 9% increase, obviously above your 5% to 7% long-term range. Should we think, I know you can\u2019t get specific beyond 2014, but should we think of that 5% to 7% as being sort of a CAGR, I believe you previously said from 12% to 17%, or should we think of years beyond '14 as being in that 5% to 7% range?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. This is Pat. We're still using 2012 weather normalize as our base for that. So if you still use that and use a 5%, that's the range we're talking about long-term.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","As a cager, meaning there maybe. Okay. So there may be some lumpiness between here and there, but that's the endpoint, right?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, absolutely.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. My next question is just maybe I need a reminder of the rate case process in Iowa, but if you do go ahead with a rate case rather than a settlement, when would the new rates take effect, and how big of an impact is that in your '14 guidance?","Patricia L. Kampling","We have it. Pretty well factored and what happened in Iowa is if we file a case, we will not be requesting interim rate. We will request final rates -- would be at the end of the year most likely. Again, there's not a set schedule. We would expect it to be the end of the year, and any refund, at all, would be retroactive back to the February date, when the DAEC payment changes from the old agreement to the new payment. And all of that is reflected in our 2014 guidance.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Meaning, retroactive refund is embedded in your guidance or potential?","Patricia L. Kampling","A Potential. Whatever the options are at the end of the case we have reflected in the guidance.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. I guess, maybe what I am a little confused about when is what would make your earned ROE increase in '14 if the new rates wouldn't take effect until say January of '15?","Patricia L. Kampling","It has to do with the math, Andy, about the -- capacity payments going away and additional rate base getting added. The earning on additional rate base and having lower capacity payments.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, okay. Maybe I'll follow up them offline. And then just lastly, the equity, was it $250 million over the 2-year period of '15 and '16 or in each of those years?","Thomas L. Hanson","No, it's in aggregate. So it's for both of those 2 years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no other questions in the queue at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

We appreciate your participation.","With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Larsen, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President and CFO, as well as other members of the senior management team.","Following prepared remarks by Pat, John, and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter financial results, and affirmed the consolidated 2019 earnings guidance issued in November 2018. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the investor's page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and our 10-Q which will be available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thanks, Su. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to share with you our first quarter 2019 results and highlight progress-to-date on key strategic priorities.","We had a solid start to the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, with an additional $0.05 per share benefit from higher sales due to colder than normal temperatures. With these results, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share.","In the first quarter, we also achieved a major milestone accelerating our progress towards cleaner energy with our English Farms and Upland Prairie wind farms being placed in service in late March.","As you are well aware, we filed our electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa on March 1 with electric interim rates effective on April 1. This was the first filing that included a forward looking test year.","The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the significant investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie wind farms, enhancements to our distribution network, and upgrades to customer service technologies. A large portion of this increase has been offset from the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel costs, from the new wind farms.","As part of the electric filing, we requested a renewable energy rider which would allow recovery of pre-approved investments in renewable energy when they are placed in service. If approved, this rider would reduce the likelihood of a 2021 test year rate review, seeking full recovery of our next group of wind farms.","For our gas customers, the rate review was based only on the 2020 future test year, so interim rates for gas were not necessary. This requested base rate increase will be offset by reduced energy efficiency costs and lower forecasted natural gas prices.","Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year end.","As you know, the first quarter brought very extreme weather conditions to the Midwest. Our employees did an excellent job maintaining the reliability of our generating stations, wind farms and electric and gas distribution systems during the Polar Vortex.","I would like to thank them for their dedication to excellent customer service, even in the toughest winter conditions.","Now to summarize. Our team is committed to again delivering on our financial and operational goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following:","Continue to complete large construction projects on time and at or below budget, and in a very sustainable and safe manner. Advancing affordable and cleaner energy through substantial investments in wind, construction of the West Riverside Energy Center, and enhancements to our distribution network. Delivering on 5% to 7% percent earnings growth guidance, and a 60% to 70% percent common dividend payout target. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers.","In closing, I invite you to participate in our second virtual only, annual shareowners' meeting on May 16. We look forward to expanded participation from our shareowners since you can join the meeting from any location, through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate.","On a personal note, it has been a pleasure working with all of you, and I greatly appreciated the support and confidence you had in me and my management team throughout the years","I'm leaving the company in very good hands with John taking over on July 1st. I am so proud of what we've accomplished at Alliant Energy in my seven years as CEO and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. I wish you all well and thank you for your support of our company.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Larsen","Thank you Pat, I appreciate the kind remarks. I would also like to thank you for your tremendous contributions and dedicated service to our employees, customers, and shareowners. We are all going to miss you and we wish you the very best in retirement.","Good morning everyone. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments in the first quarter. I will focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address the financial outcomes and regulatory matters.","We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, modern, and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 470 MW of wind into service for our Iowa customers.","These two new wind farms, Upland Prairie and English Farms, were on-schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators.","And we are on track to install an additional 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers in 2020. This added wind will complete the 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utilities Board. Construction is going well - and we plan to begin the turbine installation phase next month.","Our wind resources performed as expected in the first quarter, achieving an average capacity factor of 36%. Our newer wind farms are expected to achieve even higher capacity factors and provide energy production nearly 25% higher than existing.","Wind energy brings many customer benefits including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions, and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve.","Another major milestone in the first quarter was the completion of a selective catalytic reduction system at our Ottumwa Generating Station in Iowa. This environmental improvement project supports compliance obligations under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and advances our objective of improving overall air emissions. This project also represents the last planned air emission control system for our fleet.","As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are making great progress on the new West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730 megawatt highly-efficient natural gas resource is over 80 percent complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. The project is on track to be completed on time and on budget.","We're committed to providing reliable, economical energy in a sustainable manner. In addition to achieving on time and below budget project execution, we are advancing our environmental value through sustainable construction practices.","I am very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Upland Prairie and English Farms projects, Gold Envision Certifications. This certification recognizes our commitment to environmental stewardship and our collaboration with local communities and landowners.","I am also pleased to share that we were notified that two of our recently added generating facilities, our Marshalltown combined cycle natural gas facility and our Dubuque Solar project are two of three finalists for the Innovation in Sustainable Engineering Award that will be awarded at the International Conference on Sustainable Infrastructure this fall.","To be eligible for consideration, projects must demonstrate adherence to the principles of economic, social and environmental sustainability. It is an honor to be recognized for our sustainability efforts.","I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks John. Good morning everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share, compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Our utilities had higher earnings year over year driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and higher electric and gas sales due to the colder temperatures, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.","Our non-utility businesses had lower earnings year over year primarily driven by timing impacts of Tax Reform benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and higher interest expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on slide two.","Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 to $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including our wind expansion program in Iowa and WPL's West Riverside Energy Center.","First quarter earnings were in line with expectations. To assist with modeling, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will note be recognized consistently for all four quarters this year, as IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, thus skewing the earnings growth more to the last three quarters.","Slide three has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation to our portfolio, the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in low effective tax rates into the future.","Moving to our financing plans, please see slide four for details of our 2019 plan which remains unchanged. During the first quarter Alliant Energy issued 1.1 million shares of new common equity under the forward equity agreements. The remaining shares under the forward equity agreements are expected to be issued by the end of the third quarter.","To finance our wind expansion, we also issued our second Green Bond at IPL in early April. Green Bonds provide investors with an opportunity to invest in renewable projects and have helped to lower our overall cost of debt for our Iowa customers.","The 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our two utilities consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant, and as our external financing needs are reassessed.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on slide five with two notable developments in the first quarter. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board in March to implement a new energy efficiency plan for calendar years 2019 through 2023. Effective June 1st, our Iowa customers will start seeing direct financial savings from the new plan. And over the next five years, Iowa customers are expected to see approximately $180 million of lower energy efficiency costs compared to the previous five year plan.","Second is the electric and gas rate reviews filed by IPL on March 1st. On slide six we have provided the procedural schedules for the IPL retail electric and gas dockets so that you may monitor the progress of these rate review proceedings throughout the year.","These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2019. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open up the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within the one-hour time frame for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nick Campanella","Hey, everyone congrats on the quarter. It's Nick Campanella on for Julien today.","Patricia Kampling","Good morning, Nick.","Nick Campanella","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to talk about the Iowa rate case - cadence post the current proceeding that we have. If you get the renewable rider in this rate case is it safe to say that you could potentially stay out of future rate cases for the foreseeable future. How do how do we think about that?","Robert Durian","I think as Pat mentioned in here prepared remarks, I think there is a higher likelihood of us being able to stay out of a 2021 test year rate review if we get the renewable rider.","Nick Campanella","Got it. And I just want to confirm, I know we're kind of waiting on the rate case to decide for what the 2020 equity need would be. Just given we get an order by year end here, is this a third quarter or fourth quarter item for you guys to tell the market where the equity is going to be?","Robert Durian","I'd say most likely, its Robert again, Nick, most likely it will probably come up with something in the November timeframe as far as what the 2020 equity needs are.","Nick Campanella","Got it\u2026","Robert Durian","At that point, we'll open the indications of what the equity layer is for the IPL rate review which will give us kind of the final piece of the puzzle for us next year.","Nick Campanella","Great. That's it for me and congrats again to Pat. Thank you very much.","Pat Kampling","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question now from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint.","Andrew Levi","Hey, how are you guys?","Pat Kampling","Hey. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Levi","Actually, I wasn't going to - I do have one question, but first, I just want to say, Pat you did an amazing job. We're going to miss you. Investment community is going to miss you, greatly. And I know you were one of the best CEOs in my 25 year career. So you will be...","Pat Kampling","Thanks, Andrew. That's very kind. It's always been a pleasure working with you.","Andrew Levi","Great job. And then a little a little question kind of off the beaten path, not number related. I just want to get your thoughts on ATC and obviously you know, it's kind of like an annuity for you guys, it doesn't grow a lot. It's probably worth a good amount of money, that maybe someone else who may want the asset more than maybe you guys do. I'm not saying you don't want it, don't misunderstand me.","But and also you know, if you look at that versus the cost of issuing equity and that equity that you issue or that cash that you have gets put back into the utility and it grows versus ATC that doesn't grow. So if the price was right. Would that be something that you would consider kind of trading equity for ATC for no better way to put it?","Pat Kampling","You know, Andy again, this is Pat. You know, we've consider you know ATC a really good investment. As you said, it's a really good annuity income for us and it still has some growth in there and we're still optimistic about some other outside footprint growth opportunities that they have.","So you know, we consider this one of our - one of our crown jewels of our portfolio here so you know, we're definitely planning on keeping it.","Andrew Levi","Okay. That was my question. Have fun Pat with retirement.","Pat Kampling","Thank you. I will for sure.","Robert Durian","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

Today, I am pleased to share with you an overview of our 2016 results and our outlook for 2017. I will also share with you our progress and advancing cleaner energy, improving the power grid and often customer\u2019s innovative products and options.","Next, Rob will provide details on our 2016 results and 2017 guidance as well as review our regulatory schedule and comment on potential favorable tax reform. We had another good year achieving a $1.88 non-GAAP earnings per share consistent with the mid-point of our 2016 earnings guidance. This represents a 5% increase over comparable 2015 results on a non-GAAP temperature normalized basis.","Although 2016 had its share of interest and temperature swings it was on average normal for the year, so there is no need to temperature normalizes our 2016 results. Also please note on slide two, the 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the Franklin County charge of $0.23 per share recorded in the third quarter.","We also issued earnings guidance for 2017 with a midpoint of $1.99 per share a 6% increase over 2016 non-GAAP results, driven by earning on our growing utility investments. Our earnings objective remains at 5% to 7% through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. For some time growth objective is supported by continued robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and is on a temperature normalized basis.","We continued to make solid progress and providing cost effective clean energy for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We have a dynamic plan in process that gives us the flexibility to adjust our capital plans as opportunities arise.","So last evening we issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2017 till 2020 totaling $5.6 billion. The change from our November 2016 forecast was shown on slide three and are primarily due to the acceleration, the timing of utility wind generation and IPL smart meter investments, to enable customers to realize their benefits sooner.","We began a transition of a generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility owned wind and the planned retirements of our smaller, less efficient fossil generating stations. And since 2010, we have retired or converted one third of our coal-fired generation moving up towards a 2030 carbon emissions reduction target of 40%.","Our generation fleet continues to transition to a net that\u2019s cleaner and more efficient at major steps that are underway to expand our natural gas generation. In Wisconsin, we are in the early stages of construction of the Riverside expansion and in Iowa we were in the home stretch of Marshalltown construction.","The Marshalltown generated facility is now almost complete, testing is going well and is expected to go in service by early April. Forecast to capital expenditures for the facility are approximately $670 million excluding AFUDC and transmission and it will earn the authorized 11% ROE.","We anticipate Marshalltown will be included in IPL\u2019s retail electric interim rates which will be implemented 10 days after our rate filing in the second quarter. Marshalltown will be our most efficient facility to date and is expected to have 60% [less carbon] emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to [the 2005] levels for the generating units it will replace.","And Wisconsin we broke ground for the Riverside expansion last September and expect that it will supply energy to our customers by early 2020.","It\u2019s output will be approximately 730 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million excluding AFUDC and transmission.","Three courts signed their letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of Riverside and we expect PSCW approval of that agreement in the third quarter. These courts have been WPL wholesale customers for decades and we are delighted that they will be our partners at Riverside.","Our capital expenditure plan also includes some additional 900 megawatts of wind energy of which 500 megawatts was approved by the Iowa Utilities Board last year. Each term of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per KW including AFUDC and transmission, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and a [depreciable] life of 40 years.","We have selected GE as the wind turbine supplier for this expansion and acquired enough turbulence from GE during the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure all 900 megawatts of new wind is eligible for the full level of reduction tax credits.","Lower generation is the newest addition to our energy mix and we continue to gain valuable experience and help us to integrate it as well as storage into our electric system. We are currently receiving power from our three solar facilities including Wisconsin's largest solar farm located at our Rock River campus, a learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.","Solar investments such as these as well as our planned solar collaboration with the city of Dubuque work to meet our customers growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy.","The electric and gas distribution systems continues to be an area of growing investments as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardized voltages and selective reliability improvements such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network are just some of our targeted investments.","Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas system while at the same time continuing our pipeline safety programs.","This year we plan to begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real time information and data will allow us to manage outages two way energy flow and allow for remote connect and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019.","We are making good progress and offering our customers innovative solutions and options. The WP&L recently received approval for new residential customer offerings including simpler time-of-use pricing plans, a demand rate pilot, a fixed bill option and lower rates for renewable energy plans.","We are also offering both Iowa and Wisconsin customers rebates for installation of charging stations. When we filed the IPL retail electric base rate review, we plan to propose a number of product offerings for our Iowa customers as well.","As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to briefly comment on the federal initiatives and the impact they may have on our industry and specifically on Alliant Energy.","As I mentioned earlier, the transition of a generation fleet started almost a decade ago. Our plan has been based on economic monetization of our generation fleet to one that is more energy efficient and lower in emissions and water usage. Our plans were never predicated on a clean power plant, but rather they are based on providing our customers, safe, reliable and cost competitive energy while improving the environment of the communities that we have a privilege to serve.","The current debate on federal corporate tax reform is very important to our company and our customers and we are very involved in those discussion. In general, lower tax rates should be beneficial to all, however, we must look at any tax reforms in its totality and not react to specific items.","Robert will address how their current proposals would impact customers and share owners of Alliant Energy.","On the various legislature and regulatory proposals, we will continue to engage with key local, state and federal stake holders as well as customer industry groups such as EEI and navigate for our customers and share owners interest.","Let me summarize my key focus areas for the coming year. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid 2016 and will deliver 2017s financial and operating objectives. Our planning continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout is 63.3% based on our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share.","We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner.","Continuous focus on serving our customer and being partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impacted customers.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. Now I would like to turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. We released year end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for yearend 2015.","A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers may be found on slides four, five and six. The major contributors of the year-over-year earnings growth were higher electric and gas margins, and increased AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station.","I am pleased to report that temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% as forecasted. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth classes year-over-year at both the utilities. For 2016 our earnings were not impacted by temperatures, but milder temperatures in 2015 resulted in a negative $0.04 per share variance.","Before I move on to discuss 2017 guidance, I would like to point out that at the end of 2016, Alliant Energy\u2019s investment in ATC moved from WPL to one of our non-regulated subsidiaries in accordance with the PSCW order. There was no impact to Alliant Energy\u2019s consolidated financial statements as a result of this change, and we will continue including ATC\u2019s earnings with utilities in future earnings release table.","Now, let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening we issued our consolidated 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 earnings per share, a walk from the 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 estimated guidance range is shown on slide seven.","The key drivers for the 6% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments which are reflected in WPL\u2019s recently approved electric and gas retail rates, as well as the infrastructure investment for IPL which will be included in interim rates which will go in effect 10 days after we filed the retail electric rate case in the second quarter of 2017.","The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017 we expect most of the sales growth that come from commercial and industrial class.","During the past seven years we've been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions which include grid modernization, the Marshalltown generating station and investments to advance cleaner energy are driving the need for an electric base rate increase.","We expect interim rates will include an annualized electric rate base of approximately $4 billion with the blended ROE of approximate 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%.","Franklin County will be included in interim rate base since we received FERC approval for the transfer to IPL earlier this week. We're in the process of finalizing revenue requirements and supporting schedule, thus we are not disclosing the interim revenue requirement dollar amount at this time.","Customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 5% to 10% interim rate increase will be offset with tax benefit rider billing credits and refunds related to lower transmission ROE.","On slide eight we have provided the proposed regulatory schedule for the IPL electric rate proceeding as well as definitions of the key components that will be included in final rates which we expect to impact 2018 earnings.","2017 will be the final year that IPL expect to provide tax benefit rider billing credits through electric and gas customers to help reduce their cost. The 2017 credits are estimated to be close to the $76 million in credits in 2016.","As in prior years the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. The WPL retail rate case reflected electric rate base growth for our full year for the Edgewater unified scrubber and bag house which was placed in service in 2016, as well as performance improvement at Columbia.","The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As shown on slide nine, the 2017 approved retail electric and gas rate base was about $3 billion within authorized ROE of 10% and a common equity ratio 52%.","Slide 10 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 18% which is 5% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate.","Also to assist you in modeling, please note that IPL\u2019s interim rates will not be in effect until second quarter. In addition WPL\u2019s new rates are in effect for the full year of 2017, so we have eliminated the summer versus winter pricing differential for Wisconsin retail electric customers. Both are expected to result in changes to our quarterly earnings profile compared to prior year.","Turning to our financing plans, our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for 2019.","Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021 with additional tax payment reductions are expected after 2021 due to the additional wind included in our plan.","This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carry forward positions as well as future amount of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years.","Our 2017 financing plan remains consistent with our announcement last November. Our plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity later this year, as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and $300 million in WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed.","As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by renewable investments and the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision.","We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 which we have summarized on slide 11. For IPL we expect to file the next Iowa electric rate case and receive a decision on our emissions, plan and budget in the second quarter.","During the third quarter, we are planning to file the Advanced Remaking Principles for additional winds in the state of Iowa. For WPL, we plan to file a fuel-only case for 2018 by the third quarter which is customary in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed.","Also in the third quarter we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional winds for Wisconsin customers. Before I conclude my remarks I would like to share some information on potential tax reform.","There is still much uncertainty regarding the content and timing of potential tax reform. There is too early to provide details on the likely outcome. Instead, we are providing one set of assumptions from the various proposals for tax reform and the near-term directional impact of such assumptions to give some indication of how our customers and share owners could be impacted.","On slide 12, we have provided these assumptions and some of the issues that could differentiate Alliant Energy from our peers in the industry. These differences include our existing net operating loss position at our two utilities are low, non-regulated impairment debt, flow-through accounting in our Iowa jurisdiction and PTC credits generated by our wind farm.","First, we have deferred tax assets on a regulated books related to federal net operating losses that we currently expect to utilize to offset taxable income through 2021. These deferred tax assets are part of the rate base calculations for both IPL and WPL and are expected to decline over the next five years under current tax provision as we utilize such NOLs.","If 100% expensing of capital expenditures is included in tax reform, we expect the utilization of our NOLs would slow down and extend beyond 2021 resulting in modest increases in IPL's and WPL\u2019s rate base in the near-term.","Second, Alliant Energy has a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt at the parent and approximate $550 million of long-term debt at its non-regulated subsidiaries. If tax reform includes the loss of interest deductibility this relatively low debt level should not result in a significant impact on our results.","Third, we are monitoring if IPL\u2019s flow-through tax methodology will continue to be available to state commission following tax reform. If the requirements of the tax code provide no flexibility in how state commissions decide the recovery of certain property related timing differences. This could result in a slight rate increase for IPL customers over the near-term.","WPL\u2019s income taxes are normalized therefore WPL customers should not be impacted by this issue. Finally, we are advocating for the retention of production tax credit under the current phase-out rules, as well as other credits earned under the current tax code so that we may continue providing such benefits to our customers.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you throughout this year.","At this time, I will turn the call back over the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session",".","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time the company will call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning's call.

I would see a significant majority of the interim rate increase levels will be based on the Marshalltown generating station and the return on that investment.","Brian Russo","Okay. Good. Because that\u2019s been pre-approved, correct?","Robert Durian","That\u2019s correct.","Brian Russo","And you mentioned that the interim rate would be based on a blended 10% ROE, if Marshalltown is 11%, how do you get 10% blended?","Robert Durian","We have to use as precedence of what was used in the last rate cases, and because of the double leverage issue that we have to continue to apply until we can proceed with that issue in the next rate case. Really that double leverage brings down the non-advanced remaking principles down about 9.5% and therefore when you blend that with Marshalltown, Emery and Whispering Willow, that also have higher ROEs, it ends up being about 10% blended.","Brian Russo","Got it. And I may have missed this before, but did you say you have no parent debt now?","Robert Durian","That is correct. As of the end of 2016 we no longer have any parent company.","Brian Russo","Okay. So that the prior parent debt that created the double leverage at IPL no longer exist.","Robert Durian","That is correct.","Brian Russo","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next is Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you.","Susan Gille","Good morning.","Gregg Orrill","Good morning. I was wondering when for modeling purposes the -- I apologize if you said this, when the incremental CapEx on renewable projects in 2019 would go into rate base?","Robert Durian","This is Robert, Gregg. So right now were scheduled to try and put in the service the wind projects in 2019 in 2020. I would say a small portion of its going to go into 2019 and so it won't have a significant impact on the 2019 rate base. We are projecting to update our rate base information and present that as part of the information that we\u2019ll share next week, and so we\u2019ll be posting that probably sometime early next week if you want to look at that the online.","Gregg Orrill","Okay.

At this time, all lines are in a listen only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.","With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Durian, Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; and John Larsen, President; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter financial results and affirmed the consolidated 2018 earnings guidance issued in November 2017. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2018 results and updates on several of our key strategic priorities. After my remarks, Robert will provide details on our first quarter financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.","We had a solid start to the year, with first quarter results in line with our expectations. Winter temperatures returned to normal, and higher margins in both our Wisconsin and Iowa utilities resulted in quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, a $0.09 per share increase versus last year. With these results, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share.","I would also like to brief you on several developments on our strategy to deliver cleaner, cost-effective energy to our customers. The Iowa Utilities Board recently approved our additional 500 megawatts of wind generation, which brings our total approved wind generation to 1,000 megawatts. The advanced ratemaking principle for Iowa wind projects are included on Slide 2. As you can see, it was a very constructive order and our Iowa customers and communities will benefit from this expansion of clean, affordable energy.","Construction is already underway at the Upland Prairie Wind Farm and later this year, we anticipate beginning construction at English Farm. These two sites total 470 megawatts and are expected to be in service in 2019.","I would like to thank the welcoming communities that are collaborating so well with our project teams, as we work to minimize the disruptions that can come with any large scale construction project. We are finalizing site selection for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which is expected to be placed in service in 2020.","In Wisconsin, we completed the purchase of our 55 megawatt share of the Forward Wind Energy Center last month after receiving approvals from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and FERC. Our customers will benefit from lower costs, as we transition a 10-year-old wind farm from a Purchase Power Agreement to utility owned. This purchase was included in the capital expenditure plan we released in November, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WPL customers.","We are currently evaluating the different choices for additional wind generation for Wisconsin customers and anticipate making a regulatory filing later this quarter. Our plans to add up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers, with approximately 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity coming from renewables by 2024.","Wind energy brings many benefits, including annual lease payments to fund families and property tax payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. Our existing wind farms had strong performance in the first quarter, shaping an average capacity factor over 40%. Our new wind farms, we believe are more efficient, as we anticipate the energy production to be as much as 25% higher than our existing wind farms.","We're also very pleased that last month, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Dubuque solar project, the first Envision Platinum rating for solar installation. This award recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects that highlight our environmental stewardship, our collaboration with local communities and that deliver cleaner, affordable energy to our customers. This is our second Envision Platinum Award. As you might recall that the Marshalltown combined cycle facility received the same award last year.","We're making good progress on the construction of the West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730 megawatt, combined cycle facility is approximately 30% complete. It is on time and on budget and is expected to be placed in service by early 2020. The combustion turbines and generators have been set on the foundation and all the major pieces of equipment are on the site. There are approximately 500 skilled workers employed on this project and they will remain there through this fall.","As our industry evolves, the policies that govern the way we do business must also change. The Iowa legislation recently passed a bill, which includes updates to energy policy in Iowa. If signed by the Governor, the new law will increase regulatory efficiency, help Iowa families and businesses save money and provide more opportunities for business growth and job creation. Some of the provisions of the legislation include: an optional forward-looking test year to better align customer benefits with energy investments; statutory language providing for a transmission rider to promote regulatory efficiency; and an improved process for extending natural gas service to help grow Iowa's economy. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders for the benefit of our customers.","I'm excited about our achievement so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company for 2018; complete our large construction projects on time and at or below cost and in a very safe manner; continue our generation fuel transition, with traditional fossil plant retirements; advancing clear energy through the completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and our substantial investments in wind generation. Deliver on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target and we'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","In closing, I invite you to participate in our first virtual only Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 17. We look forward to extended participation from our shareowners, since you can now join a meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate.","Now I will turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2017. The key drivers for the $0.09 increase were higher electric and gas margins at our two utilities and increased customer demand caused by colder temperatures in our service territory compared to last winter. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers on Slides 3 and 4.","Excluding temperature impacts, we saw relatively flat retail sales in our service territories in the first quarter. Slightly higher temperature normalized sales at IPL were offset by slightly lower temperature normalized sales at WPL year-over-year. The lower temperature normalized sales at WPL are primarily a result of two industrial customers experiencing unplanned outages in the first quarter, which we anticipate will be resolved by the third quarter of this year.","In summary, first quarter 2018 earnings of $0.52 were consistent with our expectations. As a result, our consolidated earnings guidance of $2.04 to $2.18 per share remains unchanged for 2018.","Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impacts of tax reform and the tax benefit riders. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018. Also, note that our forecast for ATC earnings assumes an ROE of 10.2%, once the FERC's decision for the second MISO ROE complaint is issued, which is currently expected sometime during the second quarter of 2018.","Turning to our financing plans. Our 2018 financing plan remains unchanged, including up to $200 million in new common equity, an additional long-term debt at IPL and Alliant Energy Finance. Consistent with this plan, Alliant Energy Finance issued a two-year term loan of $300 million last month. As a reminder, this is part of the total planned issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance this year. The remaining up to $700 million of debt will primarily be used to refinance $595 million of term loans that are coming due in the second half of the year.","Our future financing plans continue to be driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities as well as future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefits beyond 2018 and proposed changes to the capital structures at our two utilities to maintain strong balance sheet. We currently expect to provide our 2019 financing plan as part of our second quarter earnings call in August.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 6. These recent regulatory decision and planned regulatory filings are important components of our 2018 operational and financial results. Last week, both the Iowa Utilities Board and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued their decisions on how utilities will provide the 2018 federal tax reform benefits to their customers. For our Iowa retail customers, the annual savings due to lower federal taxes are expected be approximately $75 million for 2018, including tax-related savings from IPL's electric transmission providers. Our Iowa Retail electric customers will begin receiving these credits earlier this week, and our Iowa Retail gas consumers will receive the impacts of tax reform benefits with interim rates that we implemented later this month. Our Wisconsin retail customers are expected to receive approximately $45 million of credits on their bills for 2018, beginning in July. Both state commissions deferred the decision on the utilization of excess deferred taxes created by federal tax reform to future rate filings.","Turning to our key regulatory filings for the remainder of 2018. IPL filed a test year 2017 retail gas rate review in Iowa yesterday. This filing requests recovery of investments in IPL's gas distribution system over the last six years to ensure continued reliability and safety of our system and to support economic development in our communities. A summary of the test year 2017 Iowa retail gas rate review filing and its proposed regulatory schedule may be found on Slide 7.","In Wisconsin, we expect to file a 2019, 2020 test period electric and gas rate review later this quarter. This rate review will reflect recovery of new capital investments, including the West Riverside Generating Station. Additionally, we plan to include in our filing a proposal to use excess deferred tax benefits created by the federal tax reform to help stabilize customer rates over the next two years.","Lastly, WPL plans to file a construction authority request for new wind generation for its Wisconsin customers later this quarter.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Campanella","So if you could discuss the legislation quickly and the implications to the forward plan. You guys have a very robust rate base growth CAGR, but there is still a wide delta between that and the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR. Obviously, some of that is driven from the equity issuance. And then as I understand it, the historic test year does drive lag at IPL. If you were to apply for test year to IPL, where would that put you within your 5% to 7% range?","Pat Kampling","Yes, Nick, and that's a good question. And a couple of other things that are included in that delta. Keep in mind, it's the AFUDC calculation as well. So we'll probably update that slide the next time we hit the road. But we still believe it will be in the 6% range. This whole legislation was really to help with some regulatory efficiencies, and it really wasn't intended at all to increase our earnings projections at all. So really just stick to the middle of our guidance range. This is really just an regulatory efficiencies that we're going to get out of this legislation.","Nicholas Campanella","And then just given it's an optional test year, do you have any idea of how the commission is positioned here?","Pat Kampling","No, that's some of the details we need to work out once the legislation is approved. So you know, the commission has been very proactive in the state as you're well aware. So we're fairly confident we'll get very solid rules on how to work with the forward-looking test year in the next few cases.","Nicholas Campanella","Thanks so much. Congrats again.","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

","At this point, I will turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thanks, Sue. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another solid quarter with second quarter 2015 earnings in line with our expectations. Tom will discuss the financial details of the quarter. I am pleased to let you know for the first time in years temperatures did not have a significant impact on earnings per share for the first seven months of 2015. Therefore our year end earnings guidance is trending toward the midpoint of our guidance issued in November 2014. ","Environmental regulations are in the news again and it is very important to step back for a moment and review the orderly transition of our generating fleet during the past six years. We have been planning for sweeping environmental rules that would impact our industry and developed a strategic plan that would position us and our customers well for that future. ","We completed many components of that plan, including installing of our 500 megawatts of wind, spending over $1 billion related [ph] emissions controls to our largest and most efficient generating stations and have decided to either close or convert to natural gas several older less efficient coal generating stations. To further diversify our generating fleet, we added natural gas fired generation with the purchase of the 675 megawatts Riverside Energy Center and have another 650 megawatts under construction in Marshalltown, Iowa. ","And in Wisconsin, we are proposing to build another 650 megawatt natural gas fired generating station. We\u2019ve had a very deliberate plan that transformed our generating fleet to one that is diversified, flexible, has lower emissions but ensuring that we continue to deliver reliable affordable energy to our customers. ","2015 is a significant year for our industry in how we utilize and dispatch our generating fleet. We experienced some remarkable performance at our Riverside and Emery combined-cycle natural gas generating stations. During the first half of the year, they achieved capacity factors averaging approximately 45% which is about doubled they experienced in the first half of 2014. Also, our wind generation has remained consistent with capacity factors for the first half of 2015 averaging over 35%. Lastly, our coal units have operated well with the recently installed environmental controls. ","We have a robust capital expenditure plan for 2015 which totals over $1 billion. Approximately 35% of this year\u2019s capital budget is for improvement and expansion of our electric and gas distribution systems, including bringing natural gas to underserved communities. Approximately 30% of this year\u2019s capital budget is to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of our generating units. Also, approximately 30% of this year\u2019s capital budget is for the construction of the Marshalltown Generating Station. ","Now let me update you on our large construction projects. In Wisconsin, the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 is approximately 65% complete. It\u2019s expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures forecasted for this project are approximately $300 million. ","At Columbia, comprehensive asset management program to improve the efficiency of the units started with the installation of two new cooling towers completed in 2014 and the remaining projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. ","WPL's share of the total estimated capital expenditure for these projects is approximately $60 million. We also expect to start construction of the PSCW approved Columbia Unit 2 SCR during the first quarter of 2016. Our estimated capital expenditure for the SCR is approximately $70 million. ","In Iowa, the Lansing Generating Station dry scrubber has been placed in service at a capital expenditure of approximately $55. As we previously announced, in order to replace retiring facilities and further increase the amount of natural gas fired generation, we are constructing the Marshalltown Generating Station and have proposed the Riverside Energy Center expansion. In Iowa, site construction is well underway at IPL 650 megawatt combined cycle natural gas fired Marshalltown generating station as you can see on Slide 2. ","Lehmans [ph] delivered the first combustion turbine in June and we expect delivery of the second CT this month. We plan to complete the construction of the gas pipeline to the facility this month and the transmission upgrades are underway. The transition upgrades for Marshalltown are projected to cost less than $25 million. So we now expect the total project to come in over $100 million below the $920 million cost cap. The reduced cost for the transition upgrades will not have an impact on our capital expenditure or rate base forecast since ITC will be funding the transmission. Marshalltown is expected to be in service by the second quarter of 2017. ","In 2013, WPL announced that it would require several older coal facilities and natural gas peakers. The forecasted accredited capacity loss from this retirement is approximately 640 megawatts. As a consequence, WPL evaluated a wide range of alternatives to meet the long-term energy and capacity needs for its customers. ","In June 2014, WPL issued an RFP from market-based options. After evaluating all of our options, we concluded that expanding the Riverside Energy Center was in the best interest of our customers. The proposed Riverside Energy Center expansion located at our existing Riverside site near Beloit, Wisconsin is approximately 650 MW highly efficient natural gas generating facility at an estimated cost of $750 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. ","This past April, WPL applied for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or CPCN with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for the proposed expansion. During a recent prehearing conference, questions arose over Wisconsin Electric Power Company\u2019s intervention and whether WEPCo will be allowed to propose for the first time a short-term PPA as an alternative to Riverside. Later this morning, the commission will decide WEPCo\u2019s intervention request. ","Our competitive RFP and alternative analysis with diligence, and we believe Riverside is and will be found to be in the best long-term interest of our customers. The current procedural schedule for the CPCN is provided on Slide 3. ","The proposed Riverside Energy expansion includes an approximate 2 MW solar on the properties. We also have several other solar projects under development. We\u2019re doing them for us to gain valuable experience on how to best integrate solar on a cost-effective manner into our electric system. We will own and operate the solar panels at the Indian Creek Nature Center in Iowa as well as our Madison Corporate Headquarters which are our two projects currently under development. These solar projects were part of the capital expenditure guidance we provided in November 2014. ","In July, IPL announced a settlement with EPA, the Sierra Club in the state of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa to resolve potential Clean Air Act claims and to avoid unnecessary delays and ongoing uncertainty associated with litigation. The terms negotiated in the settlement were consistent with our long-term plan for cleaner energy and most of the projects included in the settlement have already been completed or at plan. ","The EPA meetings earlier this week issued its final rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric utilities. This rule is widely referred to as the Clean Power Plan. We understand that this is just one more step on what will be a long process that includes legal challenges and the development of compliance plans. As we work with our state regulators to develop strategies to comply we will continue to take the approach of doing what was best for our customers. We are fortunate that we operate in states that have a long history of energy efficiency programs, environmental stewardship and support for renewable energy. ","How we spend our capital dollars and the pace of our capital spend is focused on ensuring we manage costs, use our resources responsibly while providing energy services and solutions to our customers. As we plan for future rate cases and work with stakeholders in developing the state clean power plants, these goals will be top of mind. ","Let me summarize the key messages for today. We had a solid first half of the year and are well-positioned to deliver on this year\u2019s financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for a 5% to 7% annual earnings growth objective and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2015 dividend increased by 8% over the 2014 dividends paid.","And we continue to successfully execute on our capital plans, completing projects on time and at or below budget. We will continue to work with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups and customers in a collaborative manner. We will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. ","And finally, I must acknowledge and give thanks again to our dedicated workforce which not only provides reliable energy to our customers but also delivers the financial results we are discussing today. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom. ","Tom Hanson","Good morning everyone. We released second-quarter earnings last evening with our adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.67 per share. Second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings are $0.11 higher than second quarter 2014. Comparisons between second quarter 2015 and 2014 earnings-per-share are detailed on Slides 4, 5, and 6. ","The adjusted or non-GAAP second-quarter earnings from continuing operations exclude a charge of $0.06 per share from the sales of IPL, Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets. The premium over the property, plant and equipment book value was more than offset by the elimination of the applicable tax related regulatory assets resulting in the charge recorded in the second quarter. We estimate the second quarter 2015 temperature impact on sales when compared to normal temperatures resulted in lower earnings of $0.03 per share. This was $0.05 lower than second quarter 2014 temperature impact of a positive $0.02 per share. ","On a temperature normalized basis, Alliant energy's residential electric sales were flat whereas commercial and industrial sales increased approximately 1% quarter over quarter. Taking into consideration the first half results, we are currently forecasting modest increase in temperature normalized sales of approximately 1% for IPL and WP&L when compared to 2014. ","The 2015 EPS guidance range factors in retail rate based settlements at IPL and WP&L. These settlements reflect rate-based increases at both utilities, offset by a reduction of energy efficiency cost recovery amortization at WPL and the elimination of the Duane Arnold Purchase Power capacity payments at IPL. ","IPL will credit customer bills by approximately $25 million ratably over 2015. By comparison, the billing credits in 2014 were approximately $70 million and occurred from May through December. Also included in WP&L\u2019s rate settlement was an increase in transmission costs related primarily to the anticipated allocation of SSR costs. As a result of a FERC order issued after the settlement, the amount of the transmission costs billed to WP&L in 2015 will be lower than what was reflected in the settlement since the PSC approved escrow accounting treatment for transmission costs. The difference between the actual transmission costs billed to WP&L and those reflected in settlement will accumulate in a regulatory liability. We estimate that this regulatory liability will have a balance of approximately $40 million at the end of 2016. We view this regulatory reliability as another mechanism we can use to minimize future rate increases for our Wisconsin retail electric customers. ","During 2015 IPL will provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers of approximately $72 million compared to $82 million in 2014. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2015 results. ","The IUB has approved a second tax benefit rider. Like the first tax benefit rider, we will accumulate benefits from two accounting method changes and a regulatory reliability which will then be passed through to customers as billing credits. The total expected billing credits are approximately $75 million. These accounting method changes are still subject to final IRS approval. ","We propose a credit customer bills with the second tax benefit rider after 2016 which is when the regulatory reliability related to the first tax benefit rider is expected to be fully utilized, and when we expect to file our next electric rate case in Iowa. ","Drivers to the difference between the statutory tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC, and the 2014 actual and 2015 forecast effective tax rates are provided on Slide 7. The consolidated AEC effective tax rate for 2015 is forecasted to be 16%. ","Turning to our 2015 financing plan. Cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We also expect to benefit from not making any material income tax payments in 2015 and 2016. These strong cash flows will be partially reduced by IPL tax benefit riders and customer billing credits. ","In our 2015 financing plan, we anticipated issuing approximately $150 million of new common equity. In March and April of this year, we issued approximately 2.2 million shares of new common equity with proceeds to $135 million through the at-the-market offering. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $15 million of new common equity through our shareowner direct plan throughout the remainder of the year. ","In June, IPL retired $150 million of long term debt. The 2015 financing plan assumes we are issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt at IPL. We may adjust our financing plan as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed. ","We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plans, we will maintain the appropriate targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. The 2015 financing plan assumed the sales of our Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets which were completed last month with proceeds of approximately $145 million, including working capital adjustments and a $2 million promissory note. ","Turning now to the ROE complaint filed against MISO transmission owners. In December 2014, FERC ordered formal proceedings to begin. To-date, various parties have filed testimony with FERC. A final decision from FERC on the complaint is currently expected in 2016.","Year-to-date impact of the anticipated reduction to APC\u2019s authorized ROE has lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. We have summarized our planned regulatory dockets of notes on Slide 8. In Wisconsin, we anticipate receiving a decision on the 2016 fuel monitoring level in the fourth quarter of this year and we anticipate receiving a decision on the Riverside expansion CPCN in the second quarter next year. ","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you throughout the year. At this time I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. ","Andrew Weisel ","Good morning guys. Couple questions on the generation fleet. First, I know the governor of Wisconsin is certainly making a claim against the EPA as part of his presidential bid. Any thoughts on how the CPP might impact your specific portfolio and CapEx plans?","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Andrew. This is Pat. The CPP rule is very different than the one that was originally proposed. So we\u2019re still analyzing this and I can\u2019t speak on behalf of our governor of course but we come from a state that has had always very good environmental rules, renewable and energy efficiency standards. So we will work with our states to make sure that we get implementation plans that work for us but right now we really need to spend the time understanding this new rule because it\u2019s very different than the proposed rule. ","Andrew Weisel ","Then the second question is on coal to gas switching, I mean in the short term, not the long term, I understand your gas plants have been running very efficiently at very high capacity factors year to date. What kind of impact does that have in terms of the near term and longer term dispatch plans and financials?","Pat Kampling","No, it really doesn\u2019t impact anything whatsoever. As you are aware, the transition on our smaller coal fleet to natural gas and keep in mind we actually had natural gas already located at those sites. It\u2019s really a transition for us to get us through the next few years as we talked about. That\u2019s not a long-term solution. The long-term solution is to add new combined cycle generating facility to our fleet. ","Andrew Weisel ","Then one other question on the load growth, I appreciate the high level of detail but maybe just an update on the trends in your local economies, especially the Wisconsin industrial side. ","Tom Hanson","Andrew, this is Tom. If we kind of look at it more broad-based we continue to see a modest number of additional residential customers being added to our system but recognizing we are seeing residential use each go down. But we are seeing some expansion in the industrial sector of our business. So that gives you kind of a sense of where we\u2019re at. So as I stated, we are anticipating about a 1% increase in sales year-over-year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Paul Patterson of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson ","Just sort of circle back on Riverside. I guess what the question I sort of had is first of all, I mean this is more of a question for Wisconsin electric. But with the merger, it seems that they are saying that they are now coming up with a lot of extra capacity and that \u2013 as you indicated previously in the call, that they can replace Riverside. But I guess what my question is \u2013 what is it in Wisconsin that prevents utilities who were not merged from engaging this kind of what would seem to be a savings methodology, do you follow what I am saying? I mean this could have been done without a merger and I am wondering just in general how we should think about that.","Pat Kampling","Paul, we\u2019ve been very deliberate in our process to make sure we have the lowest cost long-term solution for our customers. And I cannot speak on what WEnergy is thinking right now. And all we really know is what they filed at the Wisconsin Commission, believing that they have a short-term solution to offer to us which we have not seen, where they provided no details. So this is just a very new news and we\u2019ve got to work through the process here and Wisconsin Commission is going to rule later this morning on if they're allowed to be involved in the case with another proposal. ","Paul Patterson ","I mean I guess, basically get interviewed in the cases [ph] I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I mean is that fair to give a utility in the neighborhood \u2013 I mean how much of a gating factor should we look at that being in terms of what their proposal is. I don\u2019t get it. I mean that means that their proposal is unlikely to \u2013 but I mean in general though, I mean assuming that they are giving it, how should we think about that?","Pat Kampling","Yes, and Paul, it\u2019s common that other utilities get interviewed in the status in the cases, that\u2019s just very common as you follow the cases. So that\u2019s not unusual. The unusual thing here is that at the 11th hour they want to provide another proposal and they were not part of the RFP process, they did not reply to any -- they did not provide any offers when we did the RFP. So this is a little unique.","Paul Patterson ","Now you said that you\u2019ve \u2013 just to clarify this. You did say that basically you looked at all these things and this is the cheapest cost. What about this idea of combining with the utilities I guess is what I am sort of wondering here now, like it seems kind of that Wisconsin with the merger with WPL was able to come up with some savings. I am just wondering, is there something that doesn\u2019t allow utilities to cooperate in that manner without a merger?","Pat Kampling","Paul, just to be clear they merged with WPS. ","Paul Patterson ","I am sorry, WPS. I apologize.","Pat Kampling","That\u2019s okay. No but they were \u2013 and again I prefer that you address this with WEnergy but we are not part of their IRP planning process. ","Paul Patterson ","But I am just wondering \u2013 generically, I am sorry to harp on this. I am just speaking generically. Is that something that you guys look at and when these plans are put forward, the idea of partnering with \u2013 ","Pat Kampling","Now our IRP relates to our Wisconsin customers, Paul. We\u2019ll talk to you later on this if you want to follow up.","End of Q&A","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions this concludes our call.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are John Larsen, Chairman, President and CEO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night, announcing Alliant Energy's year-end and fourth quarter financial results and affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance range issued in November 2019. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions, include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and will be in the 10-K both of which will be available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Larsen","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers. And recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate National Engineers Week. Our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. And we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners, with a total shareowner return of more than 33% in 2019.","In 2019, we raised our annual dividend by $0.08 per share, which was the 16th straight year, we increased our dividend. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $2.26 per share grew by 7% over 2018's comparable number. This was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5% earnings per share growth. We continue to make great progress as we execute our customer-focused strategy. I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements, and Robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes.","First, as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet, we're proud to report we met our 2020 SOx, NOx and mercury emission reduction goals one year early. In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40%, and as of the end of 2019 we've achieved a 35% reduction in CO2 from 2005 levels.","Our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials. Our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves. We look forward to highlighting our strong ESG performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals, when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year.","We are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments, putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities. One example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200-megawatt Whispering Willow North Wind project. We now have nearly 70% of our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind, placed into service for our Iowa customers producing clean, efficient renewable energy. We are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year.","An important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas facility located in Southern Wisconsin is over 98% complete and expected to be in service producing low-cost energy for our Wisconsin customers in the coming weeks. The expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades.","Our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly $80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments, solid operational performance and lower commodity prices. Another example of our strategy in action. An efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy.","In 2019, we completed our AMI meter installations in Iowa, providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices. We also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs.","Making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy. An example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application, we call My Account. Once fully launched, customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage. This refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice, convenience and control over their energy use.","I'll highlight one last area before I turn it over to Robert. Last fall, we announced the results of a year-long voluntary resource planning process, we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. This plan balances many important goals including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees. The blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio, by building up to 1000 megawatts of solar.","In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our Wisconsin facilities. I'm excited about our accomplishments in 2019. Our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus: continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy, customer-focused investments completed on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors, balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks, John. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides.","The non-GAAP adjustment in 2019 is related to an ATC equity earnings adjustments as a result of the November FERC decision regarding MISO transmission owners return on equity complaints. The $0.02 per share of non-recurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period. Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales declined 1% in 2019 when compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers.","A few of our largest customers in Iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019 and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production resulting in a lower industrial demand. Since industrial sales generate our lowest margins, these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results.","Turning to this year's earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. Based on our current forecast, we are trending to the upper half of the range. We are also reaffirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. We have rebased our long-term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS of $2.26 per share.","Our long-term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return. The key drivers of the 7% growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review order received last month. A walk from our 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on Slide 7.","The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales, which includes the impact of leap year. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers, as they resume normal operations in 2020.","Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. These investments include the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be in service in the coming months.","In Iowa we are forecasting average residential electric bills for Iowa customers who will also remain relatively flat in 2020. As the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by $35 million of billing credits, we will provide to Iowa electric customers, related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019.","Also more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020. As we look to the future, we have also added new low-cost wind PPAs and we'll be ending the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, which will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021.","Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers.","The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral.","Our 2020 financing plan summarized on Slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $250 million of new common equity. $225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in November 2019. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities. We expect the remaining $25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our Shareowner Direct program.","Lastly, we have included our key regulatory initiatives on Slide 10. We have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation. In December and January, we received decisions regarding the first forward-looking test year rate filings in the state of Iowa. In the electric rate review decision, the IUB approved a new renewable energy rider, which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1000 megawatts of new wind after they're placed in service.","With the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls, our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in Iowa for at least the next few years. In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. This request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020.","In the second quarter, WPL also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. Key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the Kossuth wind farm we expect to place into service later this year. We will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments.","Lastly in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1000 megawatts of new solar generation we announced last fall. We continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost-effective clean energy for our customers in Wisconsin.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conferences available on our website.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within the one-hour timeframe for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning to you. Can you hear me?","Susan Gille","We can.","John Larsen","We sure can. Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. Good morning to you guys. So I wanted to follow-up in the same vein of many of your comments earlier and just ask you to elaborate a little bit first. With respect to Iowa and solar, I'm thinking more specifically on the legislative side there's been some development. And I know there was a carryover bill. I know there was perhaps a deal in the last day here at least in the local news teams. Can you talk about what any of it in Iowa from what city perspective may mean ultimately to you specifically knowing that not all of it is necessarily focused on Alliant utility-scale solar in terms of what was contemplated there?","And then separately, I'll throw my second question out there at the same time. Coming back to Wisconsin, you alluded in your remarks to some development coming up ahead in the next months. I wasn't quite sure if that pertained directly to the solar filing you're making, or with respect to the voluntary filing you made earlier is there something else in parallel we should be anticipating here? So again, I just want more of a clarification from the earlier comp -- prepared remarks.","John Larsen","Yeah. Hey, Julien. Thanks for the question. I'll touch on the first couple and I might turn it over to Robert as well. As it relates to Iowa and the build relating to solar, it's very early in the process, so as you can imagine this can change a bit.","We are evaluating that and certainly talking with stakeholders in MidAmerican. So I would hesitate to go beyond identifying the direct impacts on that right now. It's something we're keeping a close eye on. And in Wisconsin, we do have our rate filing that we'll have in the second quarter and then we're putting together the application for our first tranche of the solar investment. Those would be two that we talked about and I'll ask Robert here to add anything else to that.","Robert Durian","Yeah. So as a reminder last November we announced plans to build up to 1,000 megawatts of new solar by 2023. Think of this filing that we're going to make here in the next couple of months as the first tranche and that will -- maybe think of roughly half of that will come out with a filing in early April time frame with many more details regarding the nature of the transactions and the sites and all the details that have to go along with that types of filings.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then perhaps just if I can ask you to follow-up on the solar filing coming up here in 2Q. Some of it -- or is there anything different that we should expect in this filing versus that of your peers in the state who also pursued a similar early, let's call it, a pilot effort on the floor coming awhile. Just trying to think about different -- potentially a different set of issues, or is it pretty comparable in your mind?","Robert Durian","I'd say the one area where it may be different from what you've seen in the state historically is, we are contemplating doing some type of tax equity structure that is different from what some of the previous filings in the state event. We're still in the early stages of kind of determining exactly what that's going to look like, but expect when you see the filing come out in that early April time frame, there will be some type of partnership with the third-party to help us really try and monetize those tax benefits booked for our customers. And we see this as a great opportunity to lower the cost for our customers with these new solar projects.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Excellent. Thank you guys. Thanks for the time. Have a good day.","Robert Durian","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everybody.","John Larsen","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","First question on the emissions front, you made very impressive progress to-date and I'm glad to see you emphasizing that a bit more in the slide deck. Thanks for that too. John, I think you mentioned you'll update the corporate sustainability goal later this year.","Do you have any sense of what that means for a longer-term carbon reduction goal? You got your 2030 target. What might it take to get even bigger reduction say for carbon dioxide by 2040 or 2050? Would it be coal plant retirements more renewables energy efficiency? I imagine it's all of that but where do you see the biggest opportunities?","John Larsen","Yes. Thanks Andrew. We are excited by being able to continue to update our sustainability report in a number of environmental improvements that we've made. We do have a current 80% reduction goal that we have in there in addition to our 2030 goal.","So what we'd be looking at is, as we update our resource planning efforts and we take a look at some of our continued fleet transition, we'll review that and make further adjustments in our sustainability report.","In addition to that some of the areas for example water reduction with our West Riverside plant, our addition of wind and solar and some of the retirements we've already had, we've made significant progress in reducing the amount of water usage. Then obviously we've done some work with habitat meaning pollinator plant things in conjunction with solar installation. So very excited about the story and I appreciate you asking about that.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. Thank you that\u2019s correct.. Next question in Wisconsin, you'll be filing the rate case in the coming months for WPL. You've been holding rates flat. You mentioned some offsets, but how do you think about the potential to either keep rates flat for two more years or have a minimal increase? And then possibly related how do you think about the potential for yet another settlement? And similarly, are there any atypical issues that might come up in the filing?","Robert Durian","Andrew this is Robert. Yes I think when we look forward to the 2021, 2022 forward-looking test periods, we do believe that there will be a modest increase to our customers, but given the ability for us to use excess deferred taxes and various other regulatory liabilities that we've accumulated over the past few years and we'll see a pretty significant mitigation of any increase. So I would think of those in the kind of single digits maybe low single-digit percentage increases on an annual basis, so nothing very significant.","And so we'll continue our strong track record of maintaining pretty low or relatively low rates for our customers in Wisconsin. And as far as settlement process, we do have a long history of constructive settlements and outcomes. We would continue to look forward to working with the stakeholders to try and reach a settlement with that after we make the initial filings sometime in that second or third quarter of this year.","Andrew Weisel","Sounds good. Then just to clarify, I think in Iowa you said you're planning to stay out for at least the next two years. Just to really be explicit, does that mean that you'd file in 2021 for rates in 2022 or file in 2022 for rates in 2023?","Robert Durian","Just as a reminder with the renewable energy rider that was approved with the last rate case, we have a mechanism now to be able to get all of the rate base additions from the new wind generation that we're putting into service in 2020 in that rider which will become effective or get renewed I guess on January 1, 2021. So with that mechanism we actually think that we can stay out of rate cases for probably over a couple of years out. So at least probably into that '23 timeframe, if not beyond, depending on how well we can control costs.","Andrew Weisel","Fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.","Michael Sullivan","Hey, everyone good morning.","John Larsen","Good morning.","Robert Durian","Good morning.","Michael Sullivan","I just wanted to clarify and make sure I heard right. I think you guys had said, you were trending within the upper half of the range for 2022 -- 2020 guidance already. Was that right? And what's driving that if so?","Robert Durian","Yeah, good question Michael. You are correct that we are trending to the upper half of the range. We really have had some beneficial developments here probably in the last couple of months. We saw favorable pension costs. And we had a pretty strong year when it comes to the returns of our pension assets, which translates into lower pension costs in 2020.","We also are starting off the year very well when it comes to a fuel cost perspective. As a reminder in Wisconsin, we've got a fuel sharing mechanism where both the shareowners and the customers benefit from lower fuel costs and given how low natural gas prices are and how well our natural gas facilities are running we're able to generate some savings both for our shareowners as well as our customers.","And then we're also benefiting from lower interest expense given interest rate environments that are currently there. So those are the primary drivers that we started out the year very well with.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. Thanks. And then my other one was just -- I think you may have alluded to this a little bit, but just wanted to clarify. As far as the future of your coal fleet, I think in Iowa you're saying by the end of this year you'll come up with a new plan. But in Wisconsin is that going to happen in conjunction with the solar filing where you laid that out, or what's the avenue where that gets disclosed or discussed?","John Larsen","Yeah. Thanks, Michael, this is John. We -- when we file as Robert had noted in the second quarter as what we're expecting for the solar, we will be informing a bit more about our plans for our Wisconsin coal facilities at that time. And you're right, we are going through that process in Iowa, which would be -- I think of that more towards the end of the year.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Thanks, guys.","John Larsen","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Verition.","Ashar Khan","My questions were answered by Wolfe. So thank you.","John Larsen","Thanks, Ashar.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions this concludes our call.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.","With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Larsen, President; and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat, John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's second quarter financial results and reaffirmed the consolidated 2018 earnings guidance issued in November 2017. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our Web site at www.alliantenergy.com.","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available on our Web site at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thanks Lu, and good morning and thank you for joining us.","I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then discuss a few recent events. After my remarks John will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. And then, Robert will provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule.","So, for the headlines. First, we achieved another solid quarter of performance including benefits from weather. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance range and based on our year-to-date results, we are trending towards the top half of the range. Third, we announced our financing plans for 2019, which includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. And fourth, things are really busy here, but everything is going well.","Let me now speak to some recent events. On Thursday, July 19, an AF-3 tornado tore through Marshalltown, Iowa causing catastrophic damage to the downtown business district and many homes and businesses around it. Needless to say that most of this town's 27,000 residents with damaged homes and businesses without electric and gas service. It was a true miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured.","We were so thankful that our Marshalltown generating station operations center and training center were not damaged. So our employees were able to immediately begin their restoration efforts. But, the sheer dedication and determination of our talented teams, they replace 200 poles, strove many miles of wires and restored power to over 10,000 electric customers and released 5000 homes in under a week.","The local support of our crews has been tremendous. We greatly appreciate the patience of our customers especially as they are dealing with their own damage. We are working closely with our customers and the various agencies in Marshalltown to help the area recover as soon as possible. The total cost of our restoration efforts will not have a material impact on our third quarter results.","And last week, we announced our agreement with NextEra Energy to shorten the term for the purchase power agreement for the Duane Arnold Energy Center by five years with the new expiration date at the end of 2020. Details of this agreement can be found on Slide 2. The savings will flow back to customers and they are significant.","Starting in 2021 customers will save approximately $40 million annually which translates to a $42 per year reduction in a typical residential customers' bill. This agreement not only allows us to pass these savings on to our Iowa customers, but it also includes four new PPAs from NextEra, increasing our wind energy in Iowa. It was important to us that we replace one emissions free resource with another.","Including this additional wind, we estimate renewables will make up over 40% of our Iowa energy mix in 2021. Alliant Energy did initiate a docket with the Iowa Utilities Board requesting recovery of the one-time $110 million buyout payment to NextEra. The request includes earning a return on the payment at our weighted average cost of capital. We expect approval before year-end and based on our resource planning forecast this agreement does not increase our generation resource needs.","And the last item I want to mention is that yesterday, we launched our 2018 corporate sustainability report on our Web site. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and also shows our alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","A few key items to note include, our plan includes retiring our remaining coal facilities by 2050, a reduction in our carbon emissions for our 2005 levels of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. And renewables will be nearly a third of our total energy mix by 2030. I encourage you to review the report and see the progress we've already made for creating a better tomorrow for our customers, community and investors.","I'm excited about our achievements so far this year. Our team will continue to focus on the following goals for our company in 2018. Completing large construction projects on time at or below budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner. Advancing cleaner energy through additional wind and additional fossil plant retirements, completion of the West Riverside Energy Center and substantial investments in wind energy, deliver on our 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target, and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.","With that, I will turn the call over to John, who will provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities.","John Larsen","Thanks Pat. Good morning everyone.","Our results this quarter reflect increased earnings due to warmer than normal temperatures. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated very well responding to the increased demand for energy. In the month of June, our Riverside and Marshalltown natural gas plants experienced capacity factors above 70%. And for the quarter, our generated energy was 45% higher than second quarter 2017. Higher margins due to increased generation, lowers the customer fuel costs, controlling customer cost is always top of mind.","As we shared with you last quarter, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our request to construct 1000 megawatts of wind generation for our Iowa customers. Not only are we partnering with customers and communities despite this wind we are sourcing materials locally as well.","We are progressing towards your plan to have 470 megawatts of wind generation placed in service in 2019. At our first site Upland Prairie Wind Farm in Clay and Dickenson counties powers have been delivered and construction is underway. The turbine blades are fabricated in Newton, Iowa. At our second site, English Farms and Poweshiek County, we anticipate power deliveries and started construction in the fourth quarter of this year. The towers for these two sites will be constructed in Newton, Iowa and Clinton, Illinois. Also we have finalized and announced the site selected for the remaining 530 megawatts of the approved wind, which are expected to be placed into service in 2020.","We intend to provide additional renewable energy for our Wisconsin customers as well. In May we filed a plan with a Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to build a 150 megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa, an area with consistently strong wind resources. We anticipate a decision from the Wisconsin Commission in the first quarter of 2019. This will allow us to put the wind farm in service by 2020 qualifying for 100% production tax credits, which will provide cost benefits for our Wisconsin customers.","We're making solid progress on the construction of our West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730 megawatt combined cycle natural gas facility is over 40% complete. It's on-time, on-budget and expected to be placed into service by the end of 2019. All major pieces of equipment are onsite and we have over 500 skilled workers safely constructing this highly efficient generating facility. The West Riverside facility is the main rate base addition in the WPL retail rate review settlement for 2019 and 2020 which was approved by the PSCW yesterday. Settlement details are provided on Slide 3.","The settlement holds electric and gas customer rates flat through 2020. Our ability to hold customer base rate flat while bringing the West Riverside facility into service as a result of our success at controlling operational and fuel costs along with returning benefits from federal tax reform to our customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy.","I will now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Thanks John. Good morning everyone.","Yesterday we announced second quarter 2018 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.41 for share in the second quarter of 2017. The key driver for the $0.02 increase was higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers caused by warmer than normal temperatures in May and June in the upper Midwest.","Additionally, we are pleased by the strength of the industrial sales in the second quarter which grew 2% year-over-year. These sales increases were partially offset by the timing of income tax expenses and timing of cost incurred at our generating facilities in the second quarter. We provided additional details on our earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 4 and 5.","For the first half of 2018, temperatures in our service territory have increased Alliant line Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.07 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism we currently expect a majority of the higher margins resulting from temperature impacts at WPL will be given back to our Wisconsin customers.","As a result, the year-to-date temperature impacts, net of a reserve for WPL earnings sharing mechanism are estimated to be a $0.05 per share increase in margins.","With another quarter of solid earnings, we have reaffirmed our full year 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 per share to $2.18 per share. Due to the increased margins from temperatures in the first half of the year and assuming normal temperatures in our service territory for the remainder of the year, our full year earnings forecast is trending towards the top half of our earnings guidance range.","Five, six has been provided to assist you in modeling this year's effective tax rates for Alliant Energy and our two utilities, including the impacts of federal and Iowa state tax reform and the tax benefit writers. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 12% for 2018.","Moving to our financing plans, which we have summarized on Slide 7; our 2018 financings are progressing according to plan. During the second quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy Finance and used the proceeds to retire $595 million of term loans maturing in 2018 and to reduce commercial paper borrowing. Through July, we have completed approximately 2\/3rds of the $200 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2018. Lastly, we still plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPO later this year with $350 million being used to refinance maturing debt and the remainder to fund WPL's wind expansion program.","As we look to 2019, our plan includes issuing up to $400 million of new common equity up to $500 million of long-term debt at IPO and up to $400 million of long-term debt at IPL. This 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers, and the recently approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by the PSCW. These 2018 and 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our two utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plans if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.","Lastly, we have included our regulatory dockets of note for 2018 on Slide 8. Our regulators have issued several constructive decisions so far this year that support our wind expansion program and authorized us to provide our customers 2018 tax reform benefits with billing credits. These recent regulatory decisions and regulatory filings are important components of our near-term operational and financial results.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several months.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Durian. At this time, the company will open up the call to questions from members of the investment community. Alliant Energy's management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning's call. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Campanella","Hey, good morning.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Nick.","Robert Durian","Good morning, Nick.","Nicholas Campanella","Hey. So, I was just curious, can you give us an idea of where the $400 million of equity for '19 puts you in terms of your consolidated cap structure or the consolidated funded debt metrics?","Robert Durian","Yes, sure. I appreciate the question. And maybe to give just a little bit of background as to the '19 equity and what drove that at the $400 million level is a little precursor. So first off, there's really three key drivers for the new equity in 2019. First is the robust capital expenditure plans over the next couple of years led by the wind expansion program in Iowa and the West Riverside natural gas facilities Wisconsin. The recent IEB decision approving the second half of the 1000 megawatt wind expansion program at IPL's solidifies our deal for that 2019 equity to finance that wind expenditures.","Second, our 2018 and 2019 financing plans have also been impacted by the regulatory decisions in the second quarter by our two state commissions authorizing billing credits for the customers for the federal tax reform benefits. We've decided not to adjust our 2018 equity plan to finance these lower cash flows, but instead catch up the equity components of these lower cash flows for 2018 and 2019 with the 2019 equity plan.","And third, we've adjusted our 2019 equity plans based on the new capital structure at WPL that was approved by the PSCW yesterday. The new capital structure at WPL reflects a higher equity percentage and will issue a common equity in 2019 to achieve that higher equity percentage at WPL beginning in '19.","So with the new equity in '19, we're still going to be within that 40% to 45% common equity ratio that we target at the consolidated level. And for the FFO to debt, we're probably in the mid-teens is how I would characterize it.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it. Okay. And then with the capital program itself for the wind kind of scaling down probably more of a normal run rate here post the in-service dates. Is it safe to assume kind of minimal equity in 2020 onward or how would you kind of characterize your ongoing needs [ex-big] [ph] capital projects?","Robert Durian","Yes. So as we probably told you guys on the road, we're re-evaluating our capital expenditure plans beyond 2019 and we'll give you a better look at that when we get to the November meeting. And so I would say to be determined yet because it's still in flux. We are also pursuing higher equity layers in our Iowa regulatory capital structure and that decision most likely won't be until probably sometime in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe.","So that's still yet to be determined. And finally, we have still decisions regarding the tax reform benefits beyond 2018 that need to be decided by our regulators. And so all three of those factors will likely need to be determined or factored into what we're going to do for future equity issuances. So you need to give us a little more time to sort through that and we'll give you some more information if not later this year sometime into 2019.","Nicholas Campanella","Awesome. Just one last question on the Iowa rate proceedings that are going to be coming up here. How do you think about forward versus backward looking test year there given the new legislation for Iowa?","Robert Durian","Yes. So the legislation has been passed in May. But we're still working through the procedures on how the filings will work for a future test period. That'll probably take it through maybe the end of this year into early next year. So we probably will have a better sense of that when we get closer to the next regulatory filing date which we're targeting right now to be probably sometime in early second quarter of 2019 with the first round of wind expansions that we're targeting.","Nicholas Campanella","That's it for me. Thank you so much.","Robert Durian","Thanks Nick.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Pat Kampling","Good morning, Andrew.","Robert Durian","Good morning.","Andrew Weisel","Firs, was probably going to be a quick question here. The corporate sustainability report, appreciate all the detail and some pretty ambitious targets at least through the next decade, is that consistent with the CapEx outlook that you previously planned or might we see changes in the near term relative to a plan through 2050?","Pat Kampling","No, that's a good question. Now what's consistent with our current capital plan and also our strategic plan that's been out there for the last couple of years, we just really firmed up our statements.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. That's what I figured. Next question is on wind, how do you think about the potential for upgrades to the existing assets to get additional [PTC] [ph]. I believe that was part of the new Iowa legislation to get advanced rate making right?","John Larsen","Yes, I think. This is John. Certainly that's another part of the law that was passed back in May that the details are still being sorted out. But we do see that perhaps opportunity down the road for some wind up rates. But that's still really a work in progress for us.","Andrew Weisel","Is there a scenario where you'd be able to get that in time to qualify for the 100% or might be something more like one of the scaled down things for the following few years?","John Larsen","I think the latter.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, got it. Then one last one if I may on solar, obviously, you guys are much more focused on wind, some of your neighbors have been looking to jointly develop solar. Any thoughts on why maybe that didn't work out for you and your customers and sort of how you view solar as part of the plan going forward?","Pat Kampling","Sure, Andrew. We just had such a great opportunity with wind. We focused on that first. We're good at wind; we know how to do wind. So that was our top priority. There's definitely a role for solar. We do have several solar farms in our service territory already that we're -- I consider the more R&D for us. They're all slightly different and there's a picture of them in our investor deck, but that's something we're still evaluating as everybody needs to especially as the cost of solar technology declines.","Andrew Weisel","Appreciate the details.","Pat Kampling","Thanks Andrew.","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today\u2019s call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.

The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our investor presentation, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com. At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thanks Susan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we\u2019ve made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were, on average, normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share.","With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter\u2019s results a bit later. Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range.","So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility\u2019s robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities.","At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and size availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 400% PTCs. But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility- owned wind.","This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year.","We are in the early stages of that process, and I will discuss that in a few minutes. Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast.","Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years in the plan. As a result, we don\u2019t expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital energy plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%.","We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract with [indiscernible] to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in the Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites totaled over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of Upland Prairie site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and Bent Tree sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plant contractor for that portion of our wind expansion.","We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind for Wisconsin customers. There\u2019s a lot of interest in the RFP, and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received.","This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource, which normally enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 560 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts.","In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility-owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy\u2019s rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our supportive rural communities and farm families, and they are great partners in fueling our future.","In addition to our utility-owned wind, we recently announced a non-regulated wind investment in the Great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition on a 30% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and now finance the acquisition through a term loan.","We are being very thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing non-regulated growth opportunities, with low risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our non-regulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. Moving on to our gas generation investments. We\u2019re making good progress with Wisconsin\u2019s West Riverside Energy Center.","We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. Its outflow will be approximately 703 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter.","These co-ops have been WPL\u2019s wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The West Dubuque project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September.","Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters, and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.","Solar investment such as these, as well as the Beyond Solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us meet our customers\u2019 growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments.","On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid.","Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and offer remotely connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. We continue to execute to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid.","We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity.","Additionally, we will now retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. We are on a solid path toward a carbon emission target of 40% by 2013. We\u2019ve also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 25% by 2013 from 2005 levels. I encourage you to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our other sustainability targets by reading the 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month.","Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during the last couple of months. I\u2019m extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees, all by keeping safety top of mind. Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target.","Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner.","Continued focus on serving our customers and being the partners with our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. We released second Quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1st , and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL.","Let me turn on Alliant\u2019s retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. Now let\u2019s briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016.","Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL\u2019s and WPL\u2019s recent base rate review. Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers.","The recent rate base addition, which include electric distribution investment, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last three quarters of 2017.","Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the tax benefit rider. The 2017 electric tax benefit rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion \u2013 or $68 million. As in prior years, these tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results.","Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a tax benefit rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. Shifting to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater five scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia.","The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions reflected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan.","This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to 150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter.","We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as being prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project.","Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6.","For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel-only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received the decision on our emissions plan and budget for the second quarter. And yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500- megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers.","We are requesting rate- making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind project. In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony.","Some of the key issues addressed in the interim testimony were: return on equity, rate design and the recovery of certain capital and deferred costs. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days have been made public. The Office of Consumer Advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases proposed by the OTA and the IPL relate to different return on equity amounts.","To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Campanella","Good morning. Congrats on the recent announcements. I was just curious. I understand there\u2019s additional wind coming into focus at IPL, I think 300 megawatts is not in the forecast. And you commented a little bit about wind costs and just the magnitude of contribution that we should expect to your upcoming forecast in 3Q. Could you just comment a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the cost side?","Pat Kampling","Yes, what we\u2019re seeing is not only the install cost coming down but we\u2019re actually getting wind sites that are probably a little better than we initially forecasted. So the combination of the two, we think the overall capital plan of the \u2013 that were already issued last November, those dollars will be coming down in total, and the timing might be shifting between the years, again, depending on the construction cycles. So we come out with the new guidance in November. Don\u2019t expect it to be a full cost for additional 300 megawatts of wind. All the megawatts are going to be coming down in price. So it\u2019ll be slightly different, but don\u2019t expect it to increase by the full 300 megawatts of \u2013 if you do the math that way.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it thanks. And then just in terms of opportunities outside of wind, kind of as we bump up against the PTC roll-off here. Can you just expand on what you\u2019re seeing for gas or electric infrastructure kind of beyond 2019, 2020?","Robert Durian","Yes, Nick. This is Robert. We\u2019re focused on that right now. We\u2019re going through a part of our strategic planning process in evaluating different opportunities. Pat alluded to a few of them with the AMI foundational work that we\u2019re going to do in Iowa to try and develop some of these grid modernization opportunities that we have. We probably will be able to give you some more details and information on that one until we get to the November time frame. And we\u2019ll probably meet with you guys in the EEI conference in November to try and give more detail.","Nicholas Campanella","Great thank so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo","Hi, good morning.","Pat Kampling","Hello, Brian.","Brian Russo","I appreciate all the insight on the CapEx and shifting CapEx to fill in the wind. But why not increase your CapEx? Is it a question of rate pressure or stretching the balance sheet? Just curious.","Pat Kampling","Yes, it\u2019s a little bit of both. We always make sure, as we put our capital plans together, that it\u2019s also through the customer lens, because we don\u2019t want to be driving rate increases when it\u2019s not necessary. But the additional winds, we\u2019re still within the 5% to 7% earnings growth. We\u2019ll have more transparency and clarity for you in November as we come out with the entire CapEx plan, not just the additional wind, but the additional infrastructure investments. But it\u2019s a balance, Brian, as you are well aware, between rate increases and earnings growth.","Brian Russo","Got it. So in terms of the 5% to 7% CAGR, it seems like you\u2019re adding a lot more incremental wind than when they initially put out this guidance. And the wind has \u2013 the existing wind has 11% ROEs. I would imagine that the new filing in Iowa would also capture 11%. So are you kind of gravitating towards the higher end of that CAGR, given the higher ROEs of the incremental CapEx?","Pat Kampling","Brian, we\u2019ll just give a range. And I just want to also be very clear, the reason we\u2019re increasing our wind investment is because we have confidence that, that will qualify for the 100% PTC and that does have a time frame, a limited time frame. That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving forward with the wind at this point.","Brian Russo","Got it. Okay. And just the Oklahoma wind project acquisition. What was the thought process around that? And can you provide any details, like what term parameters?","Pat Kampling","No, we can\u2019t provide the details. When we file our Q, you\u2019ll see a little bit more information but the terms are confidential. But we\u2019re looking at investments that are close to our core, things that we\u2019re actually \u2013 we know very well. We know wind very well. We know the Midwest very well. So we\u2019re looking forward. We\u2019ll be very opportunistic. We want good partners. We want low-risk projects that have a long-term PPA with a very qualified customer at the other end. And it\u2019s just to learn, learn more about these different investment strategies. But again, we\u2019re staying very close to our core.","Brian Russo","Got it. And I don\u2019t know if testimony was filed in the IPL rate case. I think previously, the assumption was the case is unlikely to be settled because of a cautious and rate design. Is this still the case?","Pat Kampling","All right. Brian, as we talked in the past, we have a very solid and very straightforward case. However, we\u2019re very open for discussions, but we\u2019re willing to take this case through the full process. But if there is an opportunity to settle, we\u2019re definitely willing to partner in any discussions. But at this point, we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to have the full litigated case.","Again, there were no surprises in the intervenor testimony that was filed though. So we need to keep that public in maybe a couple of days. So you\u2019ll have the same takeaway that there\u2019s really no surprises in any of the testimony.","Brian Russo","Understood. And then lastly, recall if I\u2019m correct, but the 500 megawatts of preapproved wind that will be included in a general rate case to be filed in the first quarter of 2019, why not include this existing 500 megawatts in that rate case as opposed to a separate docket?","Robert Durian","Yes. Right now, Brian, we\u2019re planning on the first piece of the initial 500 megawatts to be in service in the first quarter of 2019, and then some of the remaining portions of the first 500 megawatts in the first quarter of 2020. This last 500 megawatts that we just filed for yesterday, we don\u2019t know the exact timing of that. We\u2019re still working through that. So \u2013 but we\u2019ll, obviously, make the regulatory filings in conjunction with the in-service dates and to ensure we don\u2019t have any regulatory lag and also, as Pat indicated, be very cognizant of the customer cost impact here.","Brian Russo","Got it. Okay thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ben Budish with Jefferies.","Ben Budish ","Hey good morning everybody.","Robert Durian","Good morning.","Ben Budish","Yes, I think you kind of answered this, but just on the CapEx cost shifting. In addition to some of the wind cost shifting, can you give any color on like where other spending might be shifted out? Is it other generation, distribution, anything like that?","Pat Kampling","No, not at this point. We\u2019ll give you a lot more transparency in November as we \u2013 as I said earlier, not only we do the capital plan, we also do rate case planning at the same time to make sure we\u2019re mindful of that. So as you know, we have a very flexible capital plan. We are very proud of the fact that it\u2019s very flexible. But our priority is to make sure we get this wind and that it qualifies for the 100% PTCs.","So again, as we get more details on construction cycles and sites, et cetera, we will be able to give you more color on the rest of the CapEx.","Ben Budish","Okay. Its great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill","Yes. Hi, thank you.","Pat Kampling","Good morning.","Gregg Orrill","Good morning. Just in terms of the unregulated guidance. You talked about getting up to 10% of earnings. Will the wind investments that you announced in Iowa, does that affect the unregulated goals at all? Do you think you\u2019ll get to the 10% of earnings?","Pat Kampling","Yes. No, the wind that we just filed for yesterday, that\u2019s totally regulated wind. So that\u2019s 2 very different investment profiles here. I mean, we say 10%, it\u2019s really no greater than 10%. So we don\u2019t want you to think we\u2019re going to get to 10% for the unregulated side. We just \u2013 we capped ourselves at no greater than 10%, but they\u2019re 2 totally different investment profiles.","Gregg Orrill","So you\u2019ve got the incremental 300 megawatts of wind in Iowa and the unregulated plan, how do you reconcile that with the 5% to 7% earnings growth?","Pat Kampling","Yes, they\u2019ll be all inclusive, so both the regulated wind investments and the unregulated investments in the unregulated wind is all part of the 5% to 7% earnings growth.","Gregg Orrill","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Hanson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Robert Durian, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Tom, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.","We issued a news release this morning announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter 2013 earnings and reaffirmed 2013 earnings guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com","Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued this morning and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the supplemental slides which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patricia L. Kampling","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We had a solid first quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.22 per share over the first quarter of 2012. $0.14 per share is due to a return to near-normal temperatures in the first quarter 2013 and to experiencing a record warm winter a year ago. Tom will go further -- Tom will go over further details regarding our year-over-year earnings drivers a bit later in the call.","We've experienced very interesting weather so far this year, and yesterday was no exception. Some areas of our service territories received over a foot of snow, while other areas experienced nice summer weather only a few days ago. This spring, we went from dredging the river near one of our generating stations to ensure an adequate water supply, to repair and to implement flood plans at our river stations. Today, we've managed the wet spring very well and using insights from our 2008 floods to guide our actions.","We are pleased to report that the ice, snow and the spring flooding have had little impact on our facilities or on our financial results. Even more impressive is the fact that our employees worked through these challenging conditions while improving our safety record when compared to the first quarter of 2012. Hats off to our crews. Another first quarter positive was our wind generation. Our first quarter utility-owned wind capacity factors increased from approximately 32% in 2012 to 40% in 2013.","Now I would like to take a few moments to discuss a number of positive outcomes from our regulatory efforts. Last week, WPL announced the settlement with the EPA and the Sierra Club. The terms are consistent with WPL's energy resource plant announced in 2012 and many of the commitments and the settlement are already underway.","For Edgewater Unit 5, the settlement requires the addition of an SCR, which was completed late last year and adding a baghouse and scrubber to the unit, which was just approved by the PSCW yesterday. The estimated cost approved by the PSCW is approximately $410 million, excluding AFUDC, and construction is expected to begin in 2014 and be completed in 2016.","For our Columbia units, the settlement requires the installation of a scrubber and baghouse at both units, which construction is currently underway and is expected to be completed in 2014. The settlement also requires the installation of an SCR at Columbia Unit 2, which requires PSCW approval. We plan to file a Certificate of Authority in the second quarter of 2014 and estimate that our share of the construction expenditures to be between $100 million to $125 million. The great majority of the spend for this project will occur in 2017 and 2018. We expect to place the SCR in service in 2018.","All capital expenditures associated with this settlement for the 2013 through 2016 period has been in the capital expenditure guidance we have previously provided and as shown on Slide 2. Construction is also progressing well on the installation of baghouses and scrubbers at Ottumwa at MidAmerican's Neal 3 and 4 units in Iowa. The Neal 4 project will be in service later this year and the Ottumwa and Neal 3 projects are expected to be in service in 2014.","A summary of the expected construction expenditures for our Tier 1 units over the next 4 years, the total project cost and the in-service dates for the controls is provided on Slide 3. We have now included $20 million in 2016 for the Columbia Unit 2 SCR on Slide 3. We have also added the midpoint of the estimated total project cost and in-service date for the SCR to this slide. However, we proved we have this $20 million in our 2016 overall environmental capital expenditure guidance shown on Slide 2. The 2016 totals have not changed.","Now I'll update you on the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station in Iowa. On Monday, we filed with the Iowa Utilities Board a settlement agreement with the Office of Consumer Advocate regarding ratemaking principles. IPL's initial filing was for approval of 8 ratemaking principles prior to the beginning of construction. Of these principles, the OCA and IPL were in agreement on 5 of the 8 principles, including the $700 million price cap for the project. The OCA and IPL originally had differences on 3 of the principles which will result in the proposed settlement. The proposed settlement includes our acceptance of the OCA's recommended return on common equity of 11% for the depreciable life of the facility, the use of 10.3% return on equity for the calculation of AFUDC and both parties have withdrawn their respective positions on double leverage and have agreed that these issues can be addressed in the context of future rate cases or other proceedings. On May 21, the IUB will hold a hearing for all intervening parties in the proceedings. We expect to receive an IUB decision later this year.","The IUB's efficient to grant a certificate for construction would be contingent upon IPL receiving all necessary permits and other regulatory approvals, including an air permit from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and approval for construction of a natural gas pipeline, which was filed this week with the IUB.","An important piece of IPL's resource plan is the Duane Arnold Energy Center PPA. We are pleased to receive the IUB's order for the new 11-year DAEC PPA effective in February 2014. All costs of the new DAEC PPA will flow through the Energy Adjustment Clause. Interveners raised concerns in the DAEC docket about the potential double recovery of capacity cost if IPL does not file a new base rate case in 2014, since $135 million of DAEC capacity payments were included in 2009 base rates, which was last base rate case.","We are continuing to work with various stakeholders to extend the current 3-year electric base rate freeze that expires at the end of this year. We are proposing to stabilize electric retail base rates at the current levels until the proposed Marshalltown generating station is placed in service, which is currently expected in April of 2017. Our proposal would avoid the need for multiple rate cases over the next few years and eliminate electric base rate volatility for our customers. We will continue to work with the parties and have the ability to utilize the remaining funds available from a tax benefit rider to facilitate base rate stabilization. At the end of 2013, they'll be approximately $203 million available to refund to electric retail customers.","The IUB acknowledges IPL's commitment to work with the Consumer Advocate and large customer groups to resolve this issue before the DAEC charges start flowing through the Energy Adjustment Clause. However, if the parties cannot resolve this issue, IPL will file a general rate case proceeding in the first quarter of 2014, along with the refund obligation, with an effective date of the new DAEC agreement of February 22, 2014. Any required refund will be based upon the IUB's final rate order in late 2014 and applied retroactively to February 22, 2014. We remain committed and look forward to working with the parties to reach agreement on a rate stabilization plan by February 2014.","If a rate stabilization agreement cannot be reached, the base rate case filed in early 2014 would include recovery of and return on base rate additions of approximately $500 million and other changes in revenue requirements since our base 2009 test-year case. As we discussed in the past, the DAEC capacity payment and base rates would offset the increase in revenue requirements related to higher rate base, depreciation, interest and associated operation and maintenance expenses. We also anticipate that we would likely need additional rate cases before 2017, when selected rate cases are expected to increase during that period.","So let me summarize the key messages for today. We expect to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend target. We are making great progress transforming our generating portfolio to one that is balanced with lower emissions and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations. We are focused on working safely, providing excellent customer service and improving reliability. We will manage our company focusing on operational and financial discipline, with the goal of earning our authorized returns while minimizing customer rate volatility and increases. And finally, we will work closely with our regulators and stakeholders to receive our remaining approvals in a timely manner.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. And I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, everyone. Today, we released our first quarter 2013 earnings. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $0.72 per share, which is a $0.22 per share increase over first quarter 2012. First quarter 2013 weather resulted in a positive earnings of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2012. This resulted in a $0.14 share positive variance.","Other positive drivers were quarter-over-quarter timing impact of IPL's electric and gas tax benefit riders, elimination of capacity charges related to WPL's Riverside PPA, a 2013 revenue requirement adjustment related to IPL's tax initiatives and lower energy conservation cost recovery amortization at WPL. These positive EPS drivers were partially offset by higher WPL depreciation expense, reduced retail gas base rates for WPL starting in January 2013 and losses with AER's Franklin County wind farm. First quarter comparisons between 2013 and 2012 earnings per share are detailed on Slides 4, 5 and 6.","We are reaffirming our 2013 guidance of $2.95 to $3.25 a share. While we are pleased with first quarter results, we are a third quarter company due to our summer load -- summer peak load. Thus, we are not making changes to our guidance at this time.","In our consolidated earnings guidance walk between 2012 and 2013, which has been provided in our Investor Relations presentations, we highlighted several drivers for the forecasted year-over-year earnings results. One of the largest drivers is the forecasted $0.29 per share increase in earnings due to a lower purchase power capacity cost, primarily related to the Riverside Energy Center which WPL purchased on December 31, 2012. To assist with modeling quarterly earnings projections, please note that of the $60 million annual Riverside capacity payments, approximately $6 million was paid in the first quarter, $28 million -- excuse me, $20 million was paid in the second quarter, $28 million was paid in the third quarter and $6 million was paid in the fourth quarter.","The economy in our service territories continued to slowly improve. The forecasted 2013 retail electric sales reflect relatively flat weather-normalized sales when compared to 2012. Sales trends between forecasted 2013 and weather-normalized 2012 by customer class are illustrated in Supplemental Slide 7.","The forecasted decrease in IPL's industrial sales in Q1 over 2012 weather-normalized sales is due to cogeneration customer outages, which increased IPL's industrial sales in the first quarter of 2012. The decreased sales to cogeneration facilities resulted in less than $0.01 per share impact to first quarter 2013 earnings.","Excluding the IPL cogeneration variances from industrials would have resulted in a forecasted slight increase of industrial sales growth resulting from plant expansions and general industrial forecasted increase use.","IPL's electric and gas tax benefit riders are expected to have no earnings impact for 2013, just like they had no earnings impact in 2011 or 2012. The forecasted quarterly earnings impact of the 2013 electric and gas tax benefit riders, as well as the actual quarterly earnings impact of the 2012 electric tax benefit rider are provided in Slide 8.","Turning to our financing plans. Cash flows from operations are expected to remain strong, since we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments until 2015. Please note the 2013 cash flows are impacted by reduced customer builds in accordance with IPL's tax benefit riders.","During to first quarter, we redeemed IPL's 150 million, 8 3\/8% preferred stock and issued 200 million of 5.1 preferred stock. During the first quarter, we also redeemed WP&L's 60 million of preferred stock and have no current plans to replace the preferred stock at WPL.","Our current 2013 financing plan anticipates issuing long-term debt up to $300 million at IPL. The impact of these financings are included in the 2013 guidance. However, the onetime charges related to the redemptions are excluded from our 2013 guidance.","We believe that with our strong cash flows financing plan, we can maintain our targeted liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. Therefore, we do not plan to issue any material new equity in 2013 and we expect to announce our 2014 financing plans later this year.","Our future financing plans will be significantly influenced by the timing of the construction expenditures for the approved Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse project and the proposed Marshalltown facility. We expect a regulatory decision on the Marshalltown Generating Station in or before the fourth quarter. Slide 9 has been provided to assist you with modeling our forecasted 2013 effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC.","Turning to our regulatory calendar, we have made significant progress to date on the 2013 regulatory dockets which are summarized on Slide 10. We are awaiting one major decision yet this year, which is on the construction authorization and the ratemaking principles for the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station. The next major milestone in these proceedings is the May 21 hearings for all intervening parties.","In addition to these proceedings, we continue discussions with the OCA and other stakeholders regarding our proposed rate stabilization plan, which would run from January 2014 until the anticipated in-service of Marshalltown Generating Station, which is scheduled for April 2017.","We very much appreciate your continued support for the company. You are invited to join us at our Annual Meeting next week, which will be held on May 9th in Cedar Rapids.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate question-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just curious on Slide 7, you have your full year weather-normalized sales outlook, and it just looks like the WPL sales forecast is just a little more positive, I would say, than IPL's. You mentioned the cogen, I think, at IPL, but maybe you could just kind of comment on maybe the different trends you're seeing in each service territory.","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes. Brian, to be honest with you, we're cautiously optimistic when we see these numbers as well. But we have had 4 years of extreme weather, so we're still predicting that sales are going to be flat because weather normalization is part art, part science. But we're still predicting flat, but we are encouraged with these numbers on the slide as well.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what does the Marshalltown spending profile look like? Could you be more specific by year?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes. Brian, if you would go to Supplemental Slide 2, it's highlighted beginning in 2014 with the green bars, and then it continues in '15 and '16 as well.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Will your Q have the actual breakdown?","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes, our 10-K has it by year.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And lastly, the Franklin wind farm, I think you mentioned what the loss on a per share basis was in first quarter of '13. What are you kind of assuming in your annual guidance for that?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, we're still assuming $0.05, Brian. And the $0.02 that's in the -- the walk [ph] in press release was over last year and we had some capitalized interest last year.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Continuing on the Franklin County wind, can you talk a little bit about your contracting efforts there and sort of how those are advancing, and then just your sort of latest thoughts on monetization possibilities for that asset?","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure. As I mentioned in the past, the critical path around right now with Franklin County is to make sure the transmission constraints get alleviated. We don't expect that to be complete probably till the third quarter, so we're working on that as our first priority. I would like to tell you, though, in the first quarter, even with the constraints, the capacity factor at the site was 34%. We're pleased with the production at the facility, but right now, we're not actively looking at any PPAs or selling the facility.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the Iowa settlement, maybe just -- and I know it's a fluid situation, but give us sort of your latest thoughts on the potential for a settlement before you'd be filing that rate case.","Patricia L. Kampling","Sure. The discussions are definitely still ongoing. I'm encouraged by the discussions, but too early to predict any outcome at this point.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. And timing would still be -- I mean, we should see some advancement on that throughout the year, but it would really come to a head as we get towards the fourth quarter, I would imagine, since you'd be filing that rate case, if you were, certainly very early in the first quarter '14?","Patricia L. Kampling","Yes, this is a top priority of ours, Jay, so we're working this very, very hard. But again, it's too hard to predict what the timing will be at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Just one more clarifier on the load growth forecast. It looks like WPL was taken up and IPL came down a little bit relative to the 4Q slides. How much of that is the actual results from 1Q versus a change in the outlook?","Thomas L. Hanson","It's first quarter activity. And as Pat said, again...","Patricia L. Kampling","Weather-normalized first quarter.","Thomas L. Hanson","Yes, weather-normalized. And just to reiterate what Pat said, given the fact that we've had 4 years of restrained conditions in terms of our weather normalization calculation, and we recognize that we do go out 1 decimal point to the right here. It might imply a level of accuracy that may not exist, but we continue to look at that, and as Pat said, we're cautiously optimistic with the sales.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that makes sense. And then just one I wanted to clarify. I understand that the cogeneration outages last year may have sort of inflated the industrial volumes at IPL. But the forecast for the full year came down even relative to the February slide deck. So just wondering, is that all 1Q coming in lower than you expect? Or is that the dust settling on some of the cogen numbers from last year?","Thomas L. Hanson","No, it's the 1 quarter.","Operator","Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Manager of Investor Relations at Alliant Energy.","Susan Gille","Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Robert Durian, Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. ","We issued a news release last night, announcing Alliant Energy's third quarter and year-to-date financial results. We updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com. ","Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in our investor presentation, which are available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com. ","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Kampling","Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release, which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. It also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2021 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2022 through 2026. ","Before the quarter, I am pleased to report that excessive mild temperatures, our results were according to plan. Like many others in the region, we experienced a very cool summer, which followed a very warm winter. This negatively impacted our year-to-date earnings by $0.06 per share. As in the past, this is the quarter that we update this year's earnings guidance to include the temperature impacts for the first nine months. So the new guidance is now -- has a midpoint of $1.93 per share, which is $0.06 per share lower than the midpoint of earnings guidance provided for 2017 last November. Robert will provide details for the quarter later in the call. ","Let me now focus on 2018, which you will be pleased with. We announced a 6% increase in our targeted 2018 common dividend to $1.34 per share. We also announced a 6% increase of earnings guidance with a midpoint of $2.11 per share. As shown on slide 2, the 6% increase is based on temperature-normalized earnings for 2017 of $1.99 per share and not the revised 2017 guidance that includes this year's negative temperature impact. I also want to reaffirm that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%, and our dividend payout ratio remains at 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. ","We also issued our 2017 to 2021 capital expenditure plan totaling $6.9 billion, as shown on slide 3. In addition, we provided a walk from the previous plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the CapEx increase is driven mostly by the additional 300 megawatts of wind that we've been discussing with you. This increase was partially offset by lower maintenance expenditures in generation. ","Our updated capital expenditure plan includes 1,200 megawatts of wind energy. Under current tax law, we expect all of the wind projects to qualify for the 100% federal production tax credits. Also, our CapEx plan includes additional lead beyond 2020, which we anticipate would be a combination of grid enhancements, solar and natural gas generation. And as energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment plans to best serve the needs of our customers. Approximately one half of our $11.9 billion, 10-year capital plan is for enhancing our electric and gas distribution systems, including smart meter deployment in Iowa. ","Our customers and communities expect us to not only maintain a safe and highly reliable system, but now expect us to adapt to a system that is more interactive and dynamic. We continue to make exciting progress on the development of our wind expansion. Our existing utility wind portfolio includes owned wind farms of 568 megawatts, plus approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. Our plans to reach 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity would be from renewable sources by 2024. ","Let me now share with you some of the key activities underway to expand our energy resources. In August, we filed a new advanced rate-making principal application, or RPU, with Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for up to 500 megawatts of additional utility-owned wind. In the RPU, we requested the same return equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kilowatt including AFUDC and transmission, which is lower than the cost cap approved in the last proceeding. We expect approval in the first quarter of 2018. ","In construction, we'll soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm. We are also making good progress on acquiring additional wind farms, which is all part of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion in Iowa. Our forecast assumes that 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019, and the remaining 700 megawatts of wind will be placed in service in 2020. ","Recently, we signed an agreement with We Energies to purchase a stake in the forward wind energy center, along with WPS and MG&E. We will file a joint application with the PSCW for the purchase of this Wisconsin wind farm before year-end. If approved, customers are expected to realize a savings from the transfer of this wind farm for an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. We anticipate closing in the spring of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. ","WPL's share of the facility will be 55 megawatts, with a purchase price of approximately $74 million. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released last evening, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L. We are also completing our evaluations from the request for proposal for additional wind energy options to benefit our Wisconsin customers. We anticipate filing a request for additional wind investments with the Public Service Commission before the year-end. ","We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our support of rural communities and farm families that are great partners in fueling our future. We cannot do this without them. ","Moving on to our gas-generation investments, we are in the early stages of making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will be in service by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, including AFUDC and transmission. The three electric cooperatives that signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside have received PSCW approval. We expect FERC approval of the wholesale supply agreement within the coming months. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades, and we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. ","Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on two solar projects with the city of Dubuque, which are now producing energy for our customers. These projects are in addition to our 300 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our running laboratory at our Lansing headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments, such as these, will help meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. We are also planning to install solar at West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. ","Before I wrap up, I would like to briefly address the tax reform bill released in Congress yesterday. It's too early for us to know the potential impacts of tax reform on our company and customers, especially given that changes are expected in the coming weeks. We will remain involved in the process and will continue to advocate for our customers for the economic growth in the communities we are privileged to serve. ","I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for the storm recovery assistance not only at home, but also in Florida. I'm extremely proud of their quick response and great customer care during challenging restoration efforts, all while keeping safety top of mind. With Veterans Day just a week away, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks to appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home.","Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017 and 2018. Our dedicated employees delivered solid third quarter results and will deliver on full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide the 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very safe manner. ","We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; continue focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster; and we will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. ","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. And I'll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Durian","Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share non-recurring charge from write-downs of regulatory assets due to the recent proposed settlement reached with the major intervening parties and IPL's retail electric rate review. Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the impacts on electric sales of cooler summer temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. ","IPL interim retail electric base rates and new WPL retail electric and gas base rates continue to contribute to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2017. However, as expected, these increased earnings were offset by the impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown facility, AFUDC earned on Marshalltown in 2016 and higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found on slides 5, 6 and 7.","Turning to our updated 2017 earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings generated through the first three quarters of this year have been consistent with our original earnings guidance, allowing us to narrow the range. The updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $1.89 to $1.97 per share. The change to the midpoint of our updated earnings guidance is due to the $0.06 of losses from the impact on electric and gas sales of the much milder temperatures in our service territory during the first three quarters of 2017. Excluding the impacts of these much milder temperatures, we continue to see modest sales growth in our service territories, driven by increased sales through our commercial and industrial segments. Through the first three quarters of this year, temperature-normalized sales, excluding the impact of leap year, increased approximately 0.5%.","","Now, let's review our 2018 earnings guidance. Last night, we issued our consolidated 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2018 earnings guidance range is shown on slide 8. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are infrastructure investments in our core utility business, reflecting WPL's 2018 approved electric and gas retail rates; and IPL's final electric retail rates as proposed in the settlement currently under review by the Iowa Utilities Board. IPL's interim rates will remain in effect until the IUB approve final rates by issuing a written decision expected sometime in the first quarter of 2018. ","Also, IPL plans to file a retail gas rate review next year to recover investments in this gas distribution system since its last gas rate review filed in 2012. We are forecasting IPL's interim gas base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail electric sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to temperature-normalized 2017 sale. Similar to this year's increase in sales, we expect most of the electric sales growth for next year to come from commercial and industrial classes. ","Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 15% for 2017 and 24% for 2018. This 9% year-over-year increase is primarily related to changes in tax credits, associated with IPL's tax benefit riders. Please note that the tax benefit riders have no impact on annual earnings. Also, to assist you in modeling, we would like to provide you with information concerning the assumed MISO ROE's embedded and forecasted ATC investment earnings. ","The 2017 earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.82% through the end of this year. For 2018, earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.2%. We currently expect FERC will resolve the second MISO ROE complaint sometime in the first half of 2018. Finally, we have forecasted a flat O&M trend in 2017 through 2018 as we continue to focus on cost controls for the benefit of our customers. The forecasted flat O&M trend excludes the fluctuations we expect from energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations, which were included in WPL's most recent electric and gas rate order.","Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation reductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the tax credits from wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. ","There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. In August, we entered into a new 5-year $1 billion master credit facility. And in October, we completed the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at WPL. Our 2017 plan continues to assume we will issue up to $250 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year. Our 2018 financing plan assumes we will issue long-term debt of up to $700 million at IPL, which includes refinancing $350 million of long-term debt maturing in 2018. We also plan to issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy finance, which includes refinancing $595 million of term loans maturing next year. ","Finally, our plan assumes we will issue up to $200 million of new common equity in 2018 through a combination of an ATM program and our share on the direct program. The financing plan will allow us to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL included in the most recent retail rate decision. We may adjust these financing plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. ","Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on slide 10. For IPL, we await a decision concerning the retail electric base rate review filed in April of this year. We anticipate an oral decision from the IUB before the end of this year and a written decision early in 2018. ","Also, we expect a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board concerning the advanced rate-making principals for the second 500-megawatt of wind investment for our Iowa customers at the end of the first quarter of next year. For WPL, we plan to submit a retail electric and gas rate review filing for test years 2019 and 2020 next year. The rate filing will seek recovery of the West Riverside gas facility currently under construction.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI finance conference next week. For your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2021 as well as updated rate base and construction work-in-progress estimates.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Merrill Lynch.","Nicholas Campanella","I was just curious given the 2018 guidance, what earned ROE does that reflect at your base electric businesses for WPL and IPL, respectively?","Robert Durian","Yes. This is Robert, Nick. It will be close to our authorized returns. They're both roughly in that 10% range.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it. And then I apologize if you touched on it already, but the wind expansion proposal, it seems that you're past the settlement deadline. Is there still an ability to settle prior to the hearing? Or do you see it playing out fully?","Pat Kampling","At this point, we see it playing out fully. We're still, of course, having active dialog with all the parties. But at this point, we see it as being fully litigated. So we'll expect a decision in early 2018.","Nicholas Campanella","Got it. And then just real quick, last question on the financing, I think you said $200 million of equity in '18. Is there any way that we should kind of be thinking about your forward needs kind of 3-year, your forecast period through 2021?","Robert Durian","Yes. This is Robert again, Nick. The way I would look at it is we're trying to maintain the capital structures approved or included in our most recent rate reviews. And so given the height in CapEx that we see in 2018 and 2019, we should expect some modest level of common equity there.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Pat, can I ask you the -- 2020 rate base is a huge move-up based on the slides deck you provided in the EEI deck. Can you just remind us, in terms of rate activity, will there be new rate cases in effect for you, so you would be earning on that higher rate base, which steps up significantly from '19 to '20? Could you just remind us on the rate case time frame in the Iowa and Wisconsin jurisdictions, if you can?","Robert Durian","Yes. Ashar, this is Robert. Yes, I'm assuming you're pointing to the slides that we posted for the EEI finance conference. And as you will note, the IPL specifically increased about $900 million from 2019 to 2020. And a lot of that's the wind expansion that we're proposing to put into service in early 2020. And, so yes, that would require us to go in for a rate review with a test year 2019 rate review at this point in time. And so assuming we cannot get to some type of settlement agreement before then, that's what our current plan assumes. ","And then if you turn over to the WPL increase, you'll see about a $500 million increase from '19 to 2020. And a lot of that is based on the West Riverside plant that we're currently expecting to put into service late in 2019 and early 2020, as well as some modest levels of winds on the WPL side, too. And we expect to go in for a rate review or file for a rate review sometime most likely in the second quarter of 2018 for that 2019 and 2020 test period.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So can we assume that for the -- if we add the two rate bases together, if I'm right, $10.4 billion or so, so can we assume, based on rate activity, that we should be earning pretty much equal to our allowed ROE in that year?","Robert Durian","I think that's a fair assumption, yes.","Ashar Khan","And then on to that, we can add the AFUDC, right? The AFUDC is separate, right, if I understand the way you do it. Correct?","Robert Durian","You are correct.","Ashar Khan","Okay, okay. And then just going back to your comments. You said that equity is only required in '18 and '19, because then the CapEx needs to go down in 2020, right? And you get the rate increases. Is that fair? So it's really these two years as we go to the 2020 time frame. Would that be fair?","Pat Kampling","So we only really guided just for 2018 equity needs. We haven't guided you yet on '19. But it is fair to say in the years with expensive CapEx, in order to maintain our equity ratios at the utilities, historically, we've needed to issue some common equity for those. But you're absolutely right. As you see the CapEx starting to decline, the need for equity will definitely decline with that as well.","Ashar Khan","Okay, okay. So Pat, based on this forecast, it seems like you couldn't easily be on the high end of your growth rate, especially as you approach 2020. Am I missing something?","Pat Kampling","I knew you were going to say that. Robert and I would really like to get people to really just focus on the midpoint. We've been very consistent on our 5% to 7% growth targets, and we would prefer that everybody just kind of guide to the middle because that's where we've historically been and that's what we're historically planning to. But I appreciate your enthusiasm in the organization.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","I know it's a bit early for you to actually gauge how the proposed tax reform is going to impact your wind CapEx. But give us a sense for your projects, so especially the ones that would start operation in 2020, how would they fare under the changed safe harbor provision as you needed to demonstrate that continuous construction? And also, if there were to be a change in the PTC, how would that change the economics of these projects, of the ones actually already announced and the ones that you might be pursuing in the future?","Pat Kampling","Sure, Angie. No, thanks for the question, and you opened the question up very appropriately. It's really too early to understand all this. As you understand, the tax reform was issued yesterday. That's what we consider the first phase of the debate. We'll be very involved, not only in the process and the discussions, but advocating on behalf of our customers. And we know what was issued yesterday is going to change, so it's really too early for us to speculate exactly how this is going to impact our current construction program. But I'd give you my word that we'll be very active in the debate and the discussion on all of these very important matters. And as soon as we have more clarity, we'll be definitely willing to share that with the investment community.","Angie Storozynski","I understand. But is there something you could do, frankly, before the end of this year? I don't know, just hide yourselves against that construction progress of acquirement? To be honest, I have no idea what it would entail. I mean, I don't know, any type of construction work on the sites that are cited for the future wind farms?","Pat Kampling","Yes. Angie, I can guarantee that we're looking at all of that right now. And when we have more clarity on that, we'll definitely share it with you. So that's something that we're actively looking at right now.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Greg Reiss with Millennium.","Greg Reiss","Just a quick question. I know you guys said you're targeting the authorized equity [indiscernible] with the utilities. Can you tell us kind of what the plan is for the consolidated entity? It sounds like a debt -- I guess, an equity to cap perspective?","Robert Durian","Sure, Greg. This is Robert. I would think of it in the context of we're trying to maintain the current credit ratings we have at the consolidated level. And so, right now, I think we're in that probably 40% to 45% equity percentage for the consolidated group. And I'd say we're going to stay pretty consistent with that.","Operator","And Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","If no more questions, this concludes our call.

We thank you for your service to our country and for protecting our freedom. Enjoy your special day.","Yesterday we issued two press releases. The first press release described our plans to build a combined cycle, 650 megawatt natural gas fuel facility, which we are referring to as the Riverside Energy Center expansion located on our property in Beloit, Wisconsin. The estimated capital expenditure range for this facility is between $725 million and $775 million excluding AFUDC and transmission.","The second press release provided third quarter and year-to-date results, our revised 2014 earnings guidance range and our 2015 earnings guidance and targeted common stock dividend. That release also updated capital expenditure plans through 2017 and provided our capital expenditure plans for 2018 through 2023.","Let me start with year-to-date 2014 financial results. I am pleased to report that we\u2019ve had another solid quarter as our employees continue to manage our operations in a manner that has allowed us to meet our operating plan, objectives for safety, reliability, customer cost, and financial performance.","In fact, our weather-normalized earnings are in line with the midpoint of our earnings guidance of $3.40 per share. However, we have increased and narrowed the midpoint of our earnings guidance range to $3.48 per share to incorporate the positive $0.08 per share weather year-to-date. The $0.12 per share weather benefit realized in the first quarter of the year, mostly due to the winter that we all want to forget, still far outweighed the $0.04 per share cooler than normal weather experienced during the second and third quarters.","Now looking at next year, the midpoint of our guidance for 2015 is $3.60 per share, a 6% increase from our projected weather-normalized 2014 guidance of $3.40 per share. Our long-term earnings growth objective continues to be 5% to 7% based on 2013 weather-normalized earnings and 2015\u2019s guidance is within that range as detailed on Slide 2.","The earnings guidance increase in 2015 is a result of our ability to earn our authorized turns on rate base additions of book utilizes, which was incorporated in both retail base rate settlements. These settlements provide increased certainty for customers as well as allow us the opportunity to earn on an increasing rate base without the inherit uncertainty of traditional contested rate cases through 2016.","The IPL settlement utilize the capacity payments that are included in base rates under the prior DAEC purchase power agreement to more than offset rate-based growth and other traditional changes and revenue requirements. The result allowed us to refund the difference to customers for each year of the settlement. The customer refunds will flow through the energy adjustment clause, offsetting some of the expense related to the new energy-only DAEC contract that was effective in February 2014.","The WPL settlement utilized excess energy efficiency recoveries to offset increases in revenue requirements. A balance of approximately $50 million will be amortized over the next two years to offset increases in electric revenue requirements, including the return on and off rate base additions.","To summarize, both retail rate case settlements allow us on our increasing rate base while keeping retail electric base rates stable. These retail rate settlements are an excellent example of the creative and prudent means by which our state regulators, consumer groups and customers have worked together in a collaborative manner to create rate certainty for customers and our ability to earn authorized returns.","Yesterday we also announced an 8% increase in our targeted 2015 common dividend level to $2.20 per share from our current annual dividend of $2.04 per share. The dividend target is consistent with our long-term target dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings.","We issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2014 to 2018, totaling $5.2 billion, shown on Slide 3. In addition, we have provided a walk from the previous 2014 to 2017 capital expenditure plan to our current plan shown on Slide 4. As you can see on Slide 4, the increase in our forecasted 2014 to 2017 capital expenditure plan is driven primarily by investments in our electric and gas distribution systems and the proposed Riverside Energy Center expansion at WPL, which I will discuss in a few minutes.","There are two main reasons for the increased capital needs in our gas distribution business. First, we are anticipating the new gas pipeline safety rules will be issued in 2015 and we expect that these new rules will likely require an acceleration of older pipeline replacements. Second, we are working with several communities that are requesting new or expanded natural gas service. One example is the new 13 mile pipeline to serve a several large industrial customers in Iowa. In Wisconsin, we have an application at the PSCW for a pipeline to expand natural gas service to the Oakdale, Wisconsin area for economic development and to service sand mines in that area. The total capital expenditure associated with these two projects is approximately $40 million.","The other press release issued yesterday described our proposed expansion of the Riverside Energy Center to replace approximately 700 megawatts of capacity, currently provided by several aging coal-fired and natural gas fuel power plants for which retirement is planned in the next few years. We believe that a new resource will be needed in 2019 due to the previously announced coal plant retirements of Nelson Dewey 1 and 2 and Edgewater 3, as well as our plants to retire certain other aging facilities if this new resource is approved.","As you may recall, the previous capital expenditure plan included a placeholder for a 300 megawatt combined cycle facility. We anticipate filing our application with the PSCW and the first half of 2015 to construct a new 650 megawatt high efficiency gas resource at an estimated cost between $725 million and $775 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. This facility is similar to a Marshalltown generating station currently under construction in Iowa. As part of our long-term planning, the Riverside Energy Center will also be evaluated for the integration of solar energy as we continue to expand our renewable portfolio.","As I indicated earlier, citing studies have concluded that the proposed location of the facility will be Beloit Wisconsin near our existing Riverside and Rock River generating station. This site has access to gas with multiple natural gas pipeline options, solar electric transmission, and will enable economic development within our service territories. If this facility is approved, we plan to retire the Rock River and Sheepskin peaking units, which are near the end of their useful life as well as the retirement of Edgewater Unit 4. Our evaluation of converting a 45-year-old Edgewater Unit 4 to run on natural gas has shown that such conversion would not be economical for our customers.","And analyzing the need for WPL resource, we follow the same process to use in our last several new resource applications. We issued an RFP earlier this year and engaged a third party to evaluate their responses. We also compare the proposals against possible gas conversion of existing facilities and we considered construction of a new facility. Our analysis has concluded that the construction of a new combined cycle gas facility would be in the best interest of our customers and the analysis will be fully described in the application we filed with the PSCW.","On slide 5, we have provided a 10-year view of our forecasted capital expenditures. As you can see, our plan includes additional generation needs beyond 2018 which we anticipate will include gas, wind, and other renewable resources. These additional renewables in our plan will fulfill customer energy needs and assist us in complying with EPAs Clean Power Plan.","When reviewing on Slide 5, it is also important to note that approximately 25% of the 10 year capital plan will be spend on our electric distribution system to ensure reliable delivery of energy to our customers. Please note that the WP&L and IPL split of the updated capital expenditures through 2018 as well as updated rate-based estimates for 2013 through 2017 will be provided in the EEI investor presentation slide deck, which will be posted on our website later today.","Now, let me brief you on our current construction activities. As year-end approaches, this has certainly been one of our busiest construction years. I thank the employees and almost 1,000 contract workers on our property for working safely and for their assistance with these important projects. I\u2019m extremely proud of the achievements we have made and continue to make and transitioning the environmental profile of our fossil generation fleet.","We are committed to the goal of reducing NOx emissions by approximately 80% and SO2 mercury emissions by approximately 90% by 2020 as well as reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In Wisconsin, construction of baghouses and scrubbers at Columbia Units 1 and 2, a substantially complete and the environmental performance to date is better than the contractual guarantees. I\u2019m very proud to report that this project came in approximately $30 million below budget and the additional performance improvement work is currently underway. Recently, Columbia\u2019s baghouse and scrubber project was name one of the two finalists for Power Engineering magazine\u2019s project of the year and one of the seven finalists for Platts 2014 Global Energy Premier Project Award construction.","This is a well-deserved recognition and applaud and thank the Alliant Energy employees and contractors that contributed to the success of this project. The installation of the scrubber and baghouse of Edgewater Unit 5 is in-process with approximately 20% of the work complete. This project is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2016. In Iowa, the scrubber and baghouse and turbine upgrade at our Ottumwa facility as approximately 90% complete and approximately $10 million below budget and is expected to be placed in service before the end of this year.","In addition, the Lansing Unit 4 scrubber project is approximately 40% complete and the tie-in outage is planned for the third quarter 2015. Construction of IPL 650 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas-fired by Marshalltown generating station is in progress. Site construction activities are underway and this project is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2017. KBR is the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor for this project will includes Siemens\u2019 combustion turbine technology.","In addition to the progress we are making on transforming our Tier 1 units, we are preparing our Tier 2 units to be compliant with the Utility Mercury and Air Toxics Standards or UMATS by the April 2015 deadline. Based on our testing and training this year, we believe we are well positioned to be in compliance with these new regulations and to ensure flexible and environmentally compliant generating fleet that will serve our customers well.","I\u2019ll close my remarks today with a brief mention of two federal topics we are monitoring: the Clean Power Plan and the MISO ROE challenge. EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan would require states to develop plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 2030. The proposed reduction for Wisconsin is 34% and for Iowa is 16% from 2012 levels. We have been advocating on behalf of our customers for a plan that is flexible and can be implemented cost effectively and then show reliability.","The public comments we will be submitting by December 1 will have three main areas of focus. First, the EPA\u2019s plan allows us to continue to provide safe, reliable and cost effective power to our customers. Second, that the EPA recognizes the investments we are planning to make and receive full credit for those investments we have already made, no matter the location of the investment. And third, the plan must be based on attainable goals that can be achieved in a reasonable timeframe.","Turning now to the transmission ROE challenge at MISO, last month FERC sent the pending ROE challenge in MISO to settle in conference and then to hearing. FERC denied the challenge to equity rich capital structures, and upheld the existing transmission ROE incentive. During this meeting FERC stated that total ROEs, including incentives, would be capped at the top end of a reasonable range. The range of ROEs on FERC\u2019s discussion on ISO New England\u2019s authorized return on equity was from 10.57% to 11.74%. If those same bookends were applied to ATC\u2019s current 12.2% allowed ROE, we would expect Alliant Energy\u2019s range of annual earnings exposure would be a reduction of $0.03 to $0.01 per share respectively.","So let me summarize the key messages for today. We will continue to manage the company, striking a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. We have a plan that will continue to meet our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We\u2019re having a solid 2014, and increased the midpoint of our 2014 consolidated earnings guidance to reflect the benefit of weather and have provided earnings and dividend guidance for 2015.","We are making progress transforming our generation portfolio to one that\u2019s responsible with lower emissions, and has the flexibility to comply with all existing and currently proposed environmental regulations, while economically leading the energy and capacity needs of our customers. We will continue to work with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups and customers in a transparent manner as we advocate for safe, reliable and cost effective energy for our customers.","And finally, I must acknowledge and give thanks to our dedicated workforce, which not only provides outstanding service to our customers, but also delivers the financial results that we are discussing today.","Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy and I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter earnings last evening with GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.40 per share. 2014 third quarter earnings are lower than third quarter 2013 primarily due to electric customer billing credits at IPL, lower quarter-over-quarter earnings due to cooler summer weather, higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations to WPL, and higher depreciation expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by lower purchase power capacity costs related to Duane Arnold and Kewaunee. Comparisons between third quarter 2014 and 2013 earnings per share are detailed on slides 6 and 7.","With approximately 20% fewer cooling degree days compared to normal, the third quarter 2014 weather resulted in lower earnings from electric sales of $0.06 per share. This is $0.13 lower than the third quarter 2013 impact of a positive $0.07 per share. We have modest weather normalized retail sales growth in 2014. Sales trends between 2014 and 2013 are illustrated on Slide 8. You will see that the growth we are experiencing in our industrial and commercial class \u2013 customer class it partially offset with residential sales declines year-over-year. The extreme weather volatility we experienced over the last years has increase the difficulty in estimating the impact of weather has on customer usage.","IPL\u2019s tax benefit riders resulted in a negative $0.02 per share variance in the third quarter of 2014, when compared to the third quarter of 2013. The actual and projected quarterly earnings impact to the 2014 benefit riders, as well as the actual quarterly earnings impact to the 2013 tax benefit riders is provided on Slide 9. The tax benefit riders have a quarterly impact, but do not anticipate to impact full year 2014 results.","Year-to-date earnings are tracking in line with 2014 earnings guidance range in our operating plan. Comparing earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2014 versus 2013, earnings were up 9% year-over-year. Drivers of the differences between the statutory tax rates for IPL, WP&L and DAEC, and the actual forecasted tax rates for 2013 to 2014 is provided on slide 10. Please note that our projected 2014 effective tax rate has decreased to 12% versus the 16% we previously forecasted. This change in estimate resulted from higher than expected mixed service cost deductions at IPL, which immediately flow through the income statement due to flow through tax accounting methodology prescribed by IO regulators.","Now let\u2019s review our 2015 guidance. Last evening we issued our consolidated 2015 earnings guidance range of $3.45 to $3.75 earnings per share. It walked from the mid-point of the 2014 to 2015 estimated guidance range is shown on Slide 11. The 2015 guidance range assumes normal weather and modest retail sales increases of approximately 1.5% for IPL and 2% for WP&L when compared 2014. Also the earnings guidance is based upon the impacts of IPLs and WP&Ls previously announced retail electric base rate settlements and WP&Ls gas base rate decrease. The IPL settlement reflected rate base growth primarily from placing the Ottumwa baghouse and scrubber and performance improvement in service at the end of 2014. The increase in revenue requirements related to rate base additions is offset by the elimination of Duane Arnold purchase power capacity payment.","In 2015, IPL will credit customer bills by approximately $25 million by comparison the billing credits in 2014 are approximately $70 million. The WP&L settlement reflected electric rate base growth as a result of the construction in progress for the Edgewater 5 baghouse and scrubber and placing the Columbia baghouse and scrubber in service during 2014. The increase in revenue requirements in 2015 for these and other rate base additions was completely offset by lower energy efficiency costs recovery amortizations.","WP&Ls electric settlement also reflected higher forecasted transmission expenses for 2015 and 2016 and the approval of escrow accounting for transmission expense. Subsequent to the approval of the electric settlement, FERC issued an order requiring MISO to change how it allocates SSR expenses. As a result WP&L will no longer allocated certain SSR expenses which will reduce its forecasted 2015 transmission billings. But because the escrow accounting approved by the PSCW, this reduction in transmission billings will not impact earnings as WP&L must match it to 2015 transmission expenses to the recovery level reflected in the settlement. Any reduction in transmission billings below the level reflected in the settlement will be accumulated in a regulatory liability to be refunded to WP&L\u2019s customers in the future.","Retirement plan expense is currently expected to be approximately $0.05 per share higher in 2015 due largely due to anticipated reductions in the discount rate and asset returns during 2014. These amounts will be updated at year-end 2014 affirming the actual 2015 retirement plan expense. Given the changes expected with income tax expense in 2015 supplemental slide 12 has been provided to assist you in modeling forecasted 2015 effective tax rates for IPL, WP&L and AEC.","Turning to our financing plans, cash flows from operations are expected to be strong given the earnings generated by the business. We will also benefit given we do not expect to make any material federal income tax payments in 2015. These strong cash flows will be partially reduced by credits to customer bills in accordance with IPLs tax benefit riders and IPLs customer billing credits resulting from the settlement.","We believe that with our strong cash flows and financing plan, we will maintain our target liquidity, capitalization ratios and credit metrics. In October, we issued $250 million of 4.1% long-term debt at WP&L maturing in 2044 and refinanced $250 million of 4% long-term debt at the parent with a two year variable rate term loan. Before the end of the year, we plan to issue $250 million of long-term debt at IPL and we\u2019ll refinance the $60 million debt for the Franklin County wind Farm.","Our 2015 financing plan assumes we\u2019ll complete sale of our Minnesota gas distribution assets by the end of the first quarter of 2015, and the electric distribution assets by the end of the first half of 2015 and receive sales proceeds of approximately $130 million. The 2015 financing plan also anticipate issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt at IPL with a $150 million of the proceeds utilized to refinance maturity of debentures. We also anticipate issuing approximately $150 million of new common equity in 2015 through our shareowner direct plan and one or more offerings. We do not currently plan to issue any material new common equity in 2016. We may adjust our plans as being prudent if market conditions warrant and as our debt and equity needs continue to be reassessed.","We have several current plan regulatory dockets of note for the rest of 2014 and 2015 we have summarized on Slide 13. Yesterday, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission issued its oral decision to approve the sale of the gas distribution assets and determine that public common hearings were necessary in order for the commission to make a decision on the sale of the Minnesota electric distribution assets.","Next year, we anticipate it will be a decision by the IUB on the IPL emissions planning budget and we anticipate it will be a decision from the PSCW on our application just to construct the Columbia unit 2 SCR. And finally, in the first half of 2015, we will define application for a Certificate of Public Convenience Necessity to construct the proposed 650 megawatt Riverside expansion that Pat discussed previously. We will anticipate the PSCW issuing order by mid 2016.","We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with you at EEI. The slides to be discussed in EEI will be posted on our website as we do with all of our investor relations conference slides. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you, Mr. Hanson. At this time, the company will open up the call to questions for members of the investment community. Alliant Energy\u2019s management will take as many questions as they can within the one hour timeframe for this morning\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions)","And we will take our first question from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Good morning, everybody.","","Patricia Leonard Kampling","","Good morning, Andrew.","","Thomas L. Hanson","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","My question is on the increased CapEx, very impressive numbers. Tom, I think you said that you\u2019re now expecting a $150 million in 2015 and nothing in 2016. So over the two years, no change to the equity needs even though you\u2019re adding almost $350 million of CapEx. Can you sort of walk me through what\u2019s going to plug that difference? And then the second part of that question is, given that you\u2019re in rate freezes in both states for the two years, any impact on your ability to earn the lot ROEs.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","","First, you should expect that we will be earning our ROEs during the next two years. So that was a key component of the settlements in both states, with respect to the equity, we are expecting to meet the equity need to 2015, as I stated there will be no incremental leads in 2016. And the delta really will be offset with the expectation, we\u2019ll have additional cash flows from operations.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, great. Next question is on the new Riverside plant that you are talking about to help me understand the numbers in the sense that you are replacing 300 megawatts, you had been using 300 megawatts as a placeholder, did that RFP for up to 600 and now you are coming out with the plan for 650. Why \u2013 how did you lend on a significantly bigger number for the Riverside project?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Sure, I\u2019ll handle that one. First, we did our analysis with more economical for us to retire some of these older peaking units as well, that\u2019s what really made the difference between the 300 to the 700.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, great, yes. Sorry, if I missed that. And then lastly, when I go through the walk for 2015 guidance, I see $0.09 per other mostly low growth, what percentage increases that assume?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","We are assuming a 1.5% growth in retail sales at IPL and 2% growth at WPL.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Alright, thanks a lot.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Andrew, if I could just clarify something, the additional retirement of Edgewater unit 4 is also in the calculation of the megawatts.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","And how many megawatts for that one?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","225.","Andrew Weisel \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Great. That definitely fills the hole then, thank you.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Exactly, thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Brian Russo with Ladenburg Development.","","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Hi, good morning.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Just in terms of the 2015 guidance, should we assume like that the midpoint of that guidance is both utilities earning their loud ROE. I know there is upside to the earn returns at IPO and sharing bans, would that kind of get you to say the upper core tile of that range versus the midpoint?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","","You are right. Brian so the midpoint is established with those earning or authorize returns any difference from that would be within the range of the guidance.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","","Okay, great. And I would imagine in the EEI presentation, you also disclosed your updated AFUDC forecast?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","We will be providing update rate base as well as equip balances and the equip balances you will be able to calculate the incremental AFUDC.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Okay. So can we talk now about the incremental AFUDC associated with the Riverside CCGT or you just rather way for the presentation?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Yes. Brian, we are going to be posting those at the end of the day today.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Okay. Fair enough.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Thank you.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","And then I\u2019m just curious you conducted the RFP process, you\u2019ve now chosen to self build the CCGT. I would imagine Brown Field development is just competitive on a variety of different levels than any newbuild scenario that may have been submitted in the RFP is that the kind of way to look at it?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","There were a lot of different options Brian. This location and we actually own this land as part of our Riverside facility right now. It\u2019s just a really good location for gas transmission, et cetera. So that was one of the key factors in this.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Got it. Okay. And then is it also the way to look at the CCGT is that the rate impact of the added resource in base rates is going to be partially offset, or more than offset or more than offset by the capacity contracts that roll off or partially?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Yes Brain there\u2019s no capacity contracts rolling off with this new facility. But it will be a gradual, the way in Wisconsin where you earned during construction will be a gradual increase to customers over several years.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Okay. So it won\u2019t be like the magnitude as the rate increase that you are going to see from Marshalltown in IPL?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","No it\u2019d be for multiple years.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Development","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll take a question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management, LP","What happens if bonus depreciation is extended, does that have any impact on the financing or anything?","Robert J. Durian","With respect to the equity financing it would not, because of the NOLs that we have, certainly with bonus depreciation it will result in additional NOLs, but currently we are not expecting to be a taxpayer, till 2016. So with the potential extenders, that could push us in 2017, so that would not be impacting the target equity that we have planned for 2015.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management, LP","Okay. And secondly can we look at this, I guess, like the dividend hike. Can we look at this new rate as this kind of was kind of like 8% or something, can we expect now 7% to 8% growth in dividend going forward?","Patricia Leonard Kampling","The dividend will be growing as earnings grow. What we\u2019re doing is just slightly moving up in the range. And we\u2019ll evaluate that each year though.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management, LP","Okay, okay, thank you Pat.","Patricia Leonard Kampling","Sure, we\u2019ll see you next week.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management, LP","Thanks.","Thomas L. Hanson","And Miss Gill there are no further questions at this time.","Susan Gille","With no more questions, this concludes our call.
